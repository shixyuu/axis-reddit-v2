        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'I think that RTO makes people less productive at first. There’s a lot of stopping by and catching up, chatting about non-work related topics, and a healthy dose of complaining about RTO. I’ve been back to the office 3 days a week for quite a while now. My wife went back to the office in June of 2020 and has been full time in office since then. For some jobs fully remote just doesn’t make sense. Sometimes it does. Most of the time leadership is still trying to navigate this relatively new culture and are trying to please everyone. Which in turn upsets everyone.'"
