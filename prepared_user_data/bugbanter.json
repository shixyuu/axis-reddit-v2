[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/hqym09xm89j91.jpg', a user said: 'These articles never bring up \"quiet firing\", where they train your replacement and fire you on a random Friday afternoon with no notice or chance to resolve any issues. The quiet firing where employers try to find sneaky, \"legal\" ways to push people to quit so they don't have to pay for unemployment. Quiet firing that tries to get 40+ year loyal employees to quit before the company has to pay out a pension.'"
