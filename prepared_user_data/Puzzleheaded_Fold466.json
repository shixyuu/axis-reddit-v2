        "In response to 'If your experiment failed, your write up changes to “You might think x, but in fact the experimental data did not corroborate x”.', a user said: 'Indeed, Negative results that prove a hypothesis wrong are also valuable results (assuming not a failure in execution).'",
        "In response to 'Tell that to the reviewer and good luck if you're in an engineering field like computer science', a user said: 'There’s no guarantee that it will be accepted for publication of course. It depends how important the hypothesis and how convincing the falsification. As you mention, it is also surely field dependent.\nSome theories are difficult to test experimentally and devising an experiment that proves it wrong, or proves one of the possible solutions wrong, is already something.\nEven if it doesn’t lead to a publication, at minimum internally to the team, it can inform the direction of future experiments.'",
        "In response to 'Sure it is valuable but from the view point of the PI it is usually not a good idea to publish negative results of an ongoing project. There is a good chance that this will result in your funding being wasted for the benefit of another research group.', a user said: 'Good point.'",
        "In response to 'hasn't been my experience but based on content from this sub, it's fairly clear to me that many advisors are the precise reason certain students fail at obtaining their doctorate.', a user said: 'I think that is a true statement generally, however that comment from the OP washing their hands and putting the responsibility for what will follow their disappointing experimental results on their advisor is a little strange.'"
