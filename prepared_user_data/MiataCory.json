        "In response to 'You may know this offhand, can a bank directly send your paycheck to collections without warning you of garnishment or collections then mail you the remainder in a separate check? PA btw\n     Edited: answered, thanks fellas, can always count on you!', a user said: 'Usually collections can only collect a certain percentage of your check, but that's probably very state specific. My state they can only hold 60% in most cases, so you'd get a check for 40% (with all taxes and whatnot taken out still).\nThe way collections work is that they go get a judge to say \"Yep, take his money\" and then they go to your money sources (bank, job, tax return) and file garnishments on those accounts. Lots of times they skip the bank because that makes people homeless and they stop paying or having accounts to take from.\nBut, your job will garnish it before the bank sees it. HR has no choice where I'm at because once they get the court order it's out of their hands.\nIf you don't have a job or are under the table, they might go after a bank account but that's beyond my life experiences. ;)'"
