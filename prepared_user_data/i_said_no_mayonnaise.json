        "In response to 'As a recent grad who started a career this year, I'm so confused by \"quiet quitting\" and why anyone would be upset at it. I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'My old clinic closed at 7:30 but they wanted us to stay until 8:30 if we had walk-in patients at the end of the night. It pissed me off so much… if you want me to stay until 8:30, schedule until that time instead of 8:30-7:30. I never stayed that late.  It was a “minute clinic” that saw ppl for mainly vaccines and physicals, not emergency room type visits.  There was an ER one mile away and anyone that showed up after 7:20 was told to go there or I’d schedule an appointment for them the following day.'",
        "In response to 'Completing hard work, earns you more hard work.\nI'm in my 40s and work with a lot of folks younger than me as I switched careers a few years back.  I keep telling them to never get in the habit of doing other's work, or 'just helping out' without being asked.  If you do something long enough without being told to, that just becomes your job and you get reprimanded for not completing it if you ever stop.\nNo one is every going to take things off your plate, you're never going to get that help they are looking into, and they aren't going to rehire that guy who has been gone a month.  All you're doing by doing someone else's job is teaching them that they need less people to get more work done.  You're not going to get the money you save them.  All you're going to get is over worked.', a user said: 'Minimum work for minimum wage'"
