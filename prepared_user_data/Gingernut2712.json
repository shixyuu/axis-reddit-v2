I do the same hours over four days instead of 5 days. Time away from work is just as important as work. I’ve also been that person that works his ass off and you don’t get better thought of. You just get taken advantage of. So no Susan. Once I’ve hit my hours I’m going home. You don’t pay overtime,and I no longer work for free.'"
