        "In response to 'Original Post: I for one am grateful for APDs quiet quitting bc my vehicle tags are 3 years expired with no plans for renewal on the horizon. Living dangerously over here.', a user said: 'Can confirm.  Currently have the same 2022 sticker that came with my 2020 vehicle.  Incidentally, I did have it inspected and registered and got a 2023 sticker but never put it on.  Would have expired in Jan 24, and I did, in fact, intend to pay the registration.  But...I have not.\nI used to get pulled over all the time for that.  If I had an expired sticker, and I was at an intersection opposite a patrol car, I knew he was coming after me.\nI don't think I've been pulled over for anything at all in nearly 10 years.  Last time I remember was for speeding way out on, I think, 1431 near marble falls.\nAt some point it just becomes a game to see how long I can make it on the old sticker.'"
