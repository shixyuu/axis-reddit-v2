We are willing to pay and we just can't get people to apply.', a user said: 'There are plenty of talented people out there looking for jobs, your boss isn't doing one or more of the following:\naren't paying enough for the skillset they're expecting\nunwilling to allow 100% remote work\nhave a poor hiring/interview process\nThe fact is the demand for skilled/knowledgeable IT workers is out growing supply by a wide margin, and people can do simple math on inflation, if you're not getting a 10+% raise last year and 10+% this year, you're loosing income because of inflation.  The only way to fix that for most employees is to change companies.'"
