        "In response to 'Original Post: What leaders need to know about quiet quittingâ€¦ aka the labor rebellion [External Link]: https://v.redd.it/xravs6qh8ot91', a user said: 'I would also add in the significance of fragmented jobs, including job security. Straight up, I have 3 jobs, all are P/T and temporary and whilst this suits me a similar set-up is widespread and does not suit many people. It is not a 'good' situation out there in the job world. Why would I keep quiet about badness in job practices (not talking about the substance of the jobs, more the endless fixed term contracts that may get extended, though quality of a job is another thing too) when I barely benefit from the job? If it gives me such partial security? I am a researcher of sorts and mainly satisfied with the transient nature of my roles, although it is for sure relevant to note I have financial stability so don't panic each month with bills.'"
