        "In response to 'As a recent grad who started a career this year, I'm so confused by \"quiet quitting\" and why anyone would be upset at it. I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'They're upset because the whole system is built on scamming you out of time and money. You aren't a good manager/boss if you aren't squeezing every ounce of productivity out of an employee and banking the difference. When employees shirk that mindset that they have to do extra/be there more to \"earn favor/promotions/wage increases\" because they come to realize its all a lie. The employers have no other option, short of firing you, but to label you a quiter or lazy to pressure you to get back with the program.'"
