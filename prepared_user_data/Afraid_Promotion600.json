        "Quiet quitting Me male HL wife LL Have you reached that stage ? Quiet quitting not leaving because of kids or what not but just quitting on the idea of romance in your head letting go of the resentment for your own mental health  and accepting that she’s just a roommate now ? We had yet another talk yesterday about it which she acknowledged the situation made promises again and that night it was just heavy snoring, told her today that I’m disappointed that our discussion led to no improvement even after her promises she said but we both agreed to make efforts ( because yeah I turned LL4U after all this time) I told her it’s ok I don’t even want to talk about it, I’m not even pissed as usual , she’s snoring as I’m typing this next to me and i don’t even care i don’t want her anymore and the sad part is the idea of getting to this point used to scare me but now I just don’t care, I don’t even think I love her anymore just that I’m used to her.",
        "In response to 'Holy hell- are you me?  Everything you just said went down with me.  The only difference is the last time we had 'the talk' was 4 months back and nothing changed.  My mindset started to shift from frustrated to roommate after Valentine's day, and now I feel exactly like you do.\nIn a way, it's nice to know others are out there going through what I am.  In another way, I hate that others are going through it because nobody should be married and be this lonely.', a user said: 'Yeah man it sucks, we’re not alone it’s more common than you think that’s why communities like this one can help you feel slightly better, and there’s success stories in here, so there’s still hope but I don’t know for me I’m good I don’t even want to save ir or what not, and that shift is just a protection mechanism from the brain imo, because expectation=disappointment. I even told her all of this yesterday, like yo you might not see it but this situation  is killing the whole dynamic of the relationship, just so you know, after the usual gaslighting telling me she doesn’t get her princess treatment so she doesn’t feel like my wife I told her what did you expect. It’s sad but most of the time it leads to divorce, what are your thoughts on that ?'",

        "In response to 'Yes, I fully quiet quit 2.5 years ago.  I’m happier this way.  I have zero expectations of anything outside of parenting together and being buddies.  And I have the master suite to myself now, which I LOVE.  It’s my retreat.  He doesn’t know I’m done with him in that sense, but he’d be a fool to think otherwise.', a user said: 'That’s cold'",
        "In response to 'Well that's the thing....I dont bring up the issue. It's always her complaining  about my not initiating, the snide roomie remarks, then I try for a kiss or a hug and it's the dont touch me thing....I'm fucking over it..why would I want to initiate with that shit going on', a user said: 'It’s called gaslighting, making you question\nYour own sanity at times. It doesn’t work with me anymore. It’s liberating to just not care anymore'",
        "In response to 'I've been this way for over 2 years.\nI've started to miss physical connection, so I've decided to start initiating more physical contact, basically just more hugs. She almost never initiates hugs. I think it just doesn't cross her adhd mind.\nWe did have sex twice in a weekend while the youngest was having a sleepover. It was after I suggested \"just snuggles\" in bed, really not expecting more. For whatever reason she amped it up until we had sex. Maybe the same thing will happen in another 2 years...\nIt is what it is. Biding my time...', a user said: 'Isn’t this abuse to withhold sex at this point ?'",
        "In response to 'No. I don't think not wanting sex is abuse.', a user said: 'I was trying to make a joke'",
        "In response to 'Done this openly and honestly where I stated point blank, I’m not chasing, not initiating, not engaging in flirting or anything that remotely looks like intimacy or sexual tension.\nHer look was basically ok then carry on, that was the moment I gave up all aspects of any forfillment from her.\nI was gone after 12 months.', a user said: 'Might be heading that direction too sadly , I’d be\n Gone if it wasn’t for the kids'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Feel for you 10 years is crazy'",
        "In response to 'I relate so much. Like we’ll just sleep in separate rooms at this point lol', a user said: 'Might as well 🤷‍♂️'",
        "In response to 'It’s so hard to keep loving someone when you lose all intimacy.  But even harder when you do continue to love them, hoping anything you do will at least get a hug from it.  DB’s suck after investing so many years with someone.  Sorry you’re going through it.', a user said: 'And that’s the thing, I have no hope\n Anymore after today. I guess we all know where\n This is going to end'",

        "In response to 'Called checking out, and yes, very.\n I'm trainable, after 20 years, you learn funny words like why-should-I... and \"that's nice, but I'm fine thank you\"\nShe's trained me, my problems are mine, and should be kept to one's self, her problems are hers... and not mine, so I'm fine thanks.../s', a user said: 'Oh I’m sorry for you man, I wasn’t directing the comment to you but that other person « defending » the LL perspective. I can feel lot of resentment in your words'",
        "In response to 'I’m there. It took a long while but three years ago I finally moved into a spare room. I’m not going back because if I share a bed with her, I’ll think that there’s the faintest bit of hope that things could improve and hope is far worse.', a user said: 'Why haven’t you left yet ? The\n Kids ? Cause it’s the only thing holding me back at this point'",
        "In response to 'Yes. We have a disabled child. For all that’s wrong, we are good friends. But that’s it.', a user said: 'Im sorry man'",
        "In response to 'Yup. Eventually you just can't take the rejections and stop all attempts at intimacy. The DB slowly poisons the rest of your relationship and one day you discover your love for them has died, too.\nResentment comes crashing in like the Kool aid man, and you realize you don't even particularly LIKE your spouse anymore.\nI independently discovered grey rock, before learning the term. Highly recommend if you've given up.\nI stay for the kids, and because I'd have to live in an apartment with roommates instead of the dream house we have now.\nSo here I sit in my golden prison, with my co-parenting roommate.', a user said: 'I think that’s sadly where I’m getting at…\nwhat is grey rock ?'",
        "In response to 'That’s a big thing to come to terms with. I feel for you big time. I try communicating similar things to my LLBF… and I’ve just worked on coming to terms with my DB until I decide to make that final change. Thank you for sharing. As you stated in another comment this community has really opened my eyes to things and I’m thankful you posted.', a user said: 'That final change is scary and sometimes almost impossible because of all the consequences that go beyond you, kids finances etc, you really feel trapped'",
        "In response to 'Yep, reached it a long long time ago.  She claims that she has since tried to \"save\" the relationship...  but, as I point out I've tried everything I knew, and was rejected for it, not simple failure, shot down in flames.\nSo, until she picks up the relationship she tore down and does the work to rebuild it, and tells me the what and how to participate (after all, I obviously fail at this)\nWell, I just dont know what to do, so I'll do the minimum.  Even sex these days is just a passing mention like the weather.  Sometimes it actually happens, mostly not, because romance is dead, pleading is repulsive, asking is denied...', a user said: 'Those last lines summed up it, sad still. Is she actually trying or she’s fine with the status quo'",
        "In response to 'According to her she hates the status quo, she's finally realized no matter how hard she doesn't talk or insists she's fine, that dont fix anything...\nas for trying... yeah, well... \nTLDR: past has consequences even if you refuse to recognize them.\nI once ran across a definition of frustration as the space between your expectations and your perceived reality.  I long ago gave up expectations of her when it comes to me.  I don't expect her to be sexually available to me, I don't expect any form of intimacy from her...\nSo when she asks me what I want/expect from her, I answer honestly: NOTHING.  She doesn't seem to know where to go from there.  I gave up, this is the shit show it is, I'm not fine with it but, I promised her to give up, she's freed of expectations that she found so unwanted, what more can I do for her, I killed love, killed intimacy, pretty much everything that differs an intimate relationship from that of a familial/relative/acquaintance.\nShe thought that it didn't come with a cost.  When I try to tell her about what it costs, the mountain of built up issues...  but, it's fine, these are my problems and have nothing to do with her, and I have no expectations of her concerning them, just letting you know however that they make this fantasy relationship of \"putting the past behind us\" impossible.', a user said: 'Damn man, I don’t even know what to say other than I understand you, and I’m sorry . I think you’ve pretty much worded our situation better than anyone else could. The question is when do you draw the line and call it quits because what’s the point, and I want to pause on the part of past has consequences because it is exactly the thing, years of frustration lead to this today, and all those years there were warning signs there were conversations , empty promises well here we are now, don’t tell me I became ll4u one day because xyz, that’s what I told her , it’s the consequences of all the years of neglect, me my problem outside of rejection was mostly the quality of the sex, no enthusiasm , same mechanical repeatable predictable.'",
        "In response to 'One person can rarely fix a DB.  If one party wants to fix it and the other does not then it's not getting fixed.  Like a lot of HL spouses I have done everything I can to fix it myself and we'll they all fail.', a user said: 'That’s actually true, I’m so deep in this that I even forgot that perspective, mines doomed anyway so because I’m done trying to fix things'",
        "In response to 'This is exactly where I am. We just went six months without sex. She says all the right things — she misses her libido, she misses sex — but actions speak louder than words. Now, she finally told me that penetration had started to hurt. She says she will look into doing something about it but I’m not holding my breath. Last week, she brought up the subject again and mentioned that we should aim for “quality, not quantity.” I just didn’t have the heart to tell her that the quality isn’t great either. After six months, we tried to have sex and it was unbelievably awkward. I had a hard time even getting aroused.\nSo I just don’t bring it up and the issue will likely die a slow death. Every other aspect of our marriage is good, so I don’t want to divorce.', a user said: 'Exact same thing on the détails and the quality.'",
        "In response to 'I quiet quit in the sense that I’ve no longer asked for sex and don’t even bring it up. Brush it under the rug.', a user said: 'How long has it been'",
        "In response to '6 years plus', a user said: 'You didn’t have sex for 6years what you still doing with him'",
        "In response to 'Because there’s no divorce where I live, because it’s all not black and white like that.', a user said: 'I don’t know what to say other than I’m genuinely sorry for you'"
