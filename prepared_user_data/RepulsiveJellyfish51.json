        "In response to 'I would also suggest sending an email to the boss asking for written clarification about your performance review. Ask for specifics about why you've been downgraded, with each individual point. Say you want to make sure so that you can work on the necessary areas bla bla. \nIt'll force him to either retract a LOT of what he said, or to lie. Either way you'll have it in writing. \nAnd yes, document absolutely everything you do, including your base duties and any extras, if possible backtracking from your last evaluation. \nThe truth is on your side, so document document document.', a user said: 'Yes, always get written documentation and save everything: emails, memos, transcribed voicemails.\nOP is clearly NTA. But the boss is, and is absolutely failing at being a good manager.\nEmployees vent. As long as it's not in front of another team or client, then it should be acknowledged only as far as \"things to consider\" about the new policy. Basic Change Management 101 tells us the change is difficult! It usually gets resistant as a default - this is normal!!!\nIf the boss was worth his salt, he'd have called OP aside to document CONCERNS that OP and co-workers have about the new policy, to figure out ways those can be appropriately addressed. \nWHY don't they like the new policy? \nWHAT parts are concerning, and WHAT can be done to make it more acceptable? \nHOW can management work with employees to further address these concerns?\nThese discussions are important and should never be punitive!!!\nSounds like the boss man needs to go take some management classes, reflect on how his actions were incredibly inappropriate, and apologize to OP for reacting badly!!! It's okay to make mistakes, managers do that! Own up, learn to be better.'"
