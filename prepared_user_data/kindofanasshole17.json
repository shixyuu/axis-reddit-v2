        "In response to 'I use to be a mailman. If you were good at your job you were rewarded with more work. Part timers worked 7am-7:30pm, Full timers worked 7am-3:30pm. When I became full time I would finish my route and have an hour or an hour and a half to spare.\nI knew if I went back they would give me more work to do, so I would just sit around until it was a safe time to go back to the station.', a user said: 'Shit dude, mail delivery employees for Canada Post can finish their route early and go home, with management's blessing. Full days pay.\nWhich leads to the (entirely predictable) outcome that thousands of Canadians are complaining that their carriers no longer even try to deliver packages/parcels, they just leave a \"missed delivery\" notice on the door without even knocking to see if someone is home.'"
