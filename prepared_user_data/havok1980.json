        "In response to 'I'm GenX. We were taught by our boomer and silent generation parents and early employers to go \"above and beyond\" for our employers and to eat all kinds of shit and abuse to be a \"good employee\".\nWe were taught that we were being 'given a job'. Statements like \"we picked you over many others...\" were said so that we'd feel grateful for the opportunity.\nIt's all one-sided bullshit that poisoned us. It was 1930s Depression Era thinking that had people beholden to their employers and strip employees of their actual worth.\nMore and more, young people today (Millennials and GenZ) are standing up for their worth, and employers are angry about it. I'm proud of these generations for refusing to accept the bullshit the rest of us were sold.\nIt isn't \"quiet quitting\". The only thing they're \"quitting\" is being party to their own exploitation, and there's nothing \"quiet\" about it.', a user said: 'I demanded a 20% raise for my annual review and I actually got it. Guess what? If you have a skill you have value. I straight up told my boss I'd go around the corner to pack the bananas if they didn't give me what I'm worth. I'm going to request an extra week of vacation this year.\nWe've been exploited by corporations for too long.'",
        "In response to 'It's called quite quitting because mentally you've already quit the job.  You're treating the job like it's perpetually your last two weeks as you do the minimum on everything.', a user said: 'It's a corporate rebranding of work to rule. Work to rule as a concept has been around for decades.'"
