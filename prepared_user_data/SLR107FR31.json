Example:\nA 2nd shift shop was told they had to get 2 planes done a night, regardless of the fact 1st shift only had to do 1.5 planes a day.\nSo after three-four days of that entire 2nd shift shop (about 35 guys) doing\nzero\nplanes; management \"got shuffled around\" and it was back to 1.5 planes a day instead of 2 for that whole shop no matter the shift.\nProblem solved. Sometimes workers gotta grab management by the nuts and say \"Look, you fuckers in yer fancy clothes dont actually do anything 'round here.\" (metaphorically grab em, don't actually...)'"
