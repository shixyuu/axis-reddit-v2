        "In response to 'Original Post: The Flipside of \"quiet quitting\" is quiet paying. Don't forget this. Somebody older I know asked me why young people are \"quiet quitting\" their jobs and not trying to work hard. I told them that quiet quitting is a bullshit term that describes doing what was outlined in your contract, and not more. He started to tell me how you need to hustle and do more than the minimum if you want to succeed. I told him that the difference compared to many years ago is that now hard work is not met with commensurate rewards or opportunities. Then I asked him the following question:\nIf it is culturally acceptable to push people to go above and beyond what is outlined in their contract, why does the company always only pays what was agreed upon? Why doesn't payroll ever go above and beyond what was agreed? Shouldn't it also be culturally acceptable to expect extra salary in this case? Aren't my company quiet paying me?\nHe had nothing to say and just looked uncomfortable. He didn't really agree but he has no good answer either.', a user said: 'Two points.\nCompanies used to reward going above and beyond.  They used to promote from within and give decent raises and give bonuses.  I don't know what happened to promotions, but the money dried up because of trickle down economic policies.\nThe second paragraph also applies to unions.  A company is formed when a group of people pool their resources to make more money.  When it forms a company, America bends over backwards and praises them as \"Job creators\" and shovels money at them (Tax breaks, tax incentives and subsidies)  When a group of workers do it, it's called a union and America demonizes them.\nI usually hate the \"Both sides\" argument when it comes to republicans v democrats.  However, Reagan made it illegal for Air traffic controllers to strike, and Biden made it illegal for Rail workers to strike.  Yeah, there are a few differences on what occurred to get to the result, but the result is the same.'"
