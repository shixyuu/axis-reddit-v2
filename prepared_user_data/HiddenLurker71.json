        "In response to 'For my own sanity I call it acceptance instead of quitting. Don’t know why but it feels better. I’ve accepted we will never have a healthy sex life. I’ve also accepted I don’t want to step outside the marriage even with the permission she gave me. All I want is her and it happens once in a blue moon. Am I happy with that? Not in the slightest but by choice I have no other option. I’m done feeling destroyed about it. I begrudgingly accept it and try and enjoy being with my hot best friend everyday. Not sure how healthy this is but it beats feeling sorry for myself all the time. Some days are worse than others like today (hence the reason I’m here on db looking for some  kind of solace). But I know I’ll feel better when I get out of my head and get one with the day.', a user said: 'Acceptance is the best way to put it. I struggled with this and went to a Catholic priest for some advice.  Putting aside the belief that marriage is for life, he asked if my wife is the person I want to have a life with. For many reasons I believe she is the person I was supposed to marry. When I think about other women I dated before not one would have made me the person I am today with the family I have. We have built a great family (two kids attended very prestigious universities) and I am a better person for having known her these past 25 years. He said \"Some people just don't feel that way physically. You are the one who has to decide if this is important enough to offset all the good you describe in the rest of your relationship.\"\nI have committed to suck it up. Not my preference but I have at least come to accept it without personal resentment.'"
