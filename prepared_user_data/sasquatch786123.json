        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'Quiet quitting isn't new. The phrase is tho lol.\nLooks like this has been practiced in Europe for a loooonggg time.\nNice to see our American employees finally being disillusioned by their awful system, and adopting a more healthier way of working.'"
