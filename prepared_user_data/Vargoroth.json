        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'European here as well. The scariest part is that Americans actually used to have a thriving social safety net with laws that regulated everything and ensured the middle class had a decent life. The whole idyllic 50's notion that so many conservatives dream of was in fact because of worker rights and the government doing its job.\nThen a certain actor named Reagan came along and basically introduced the idea that government shouldn't serve the people. The people should serve the government. And when I say he introduced the idea I mean the rich people using him as their puppet tried to push the idea. They were already brainwashing their own people into being staunchly anti-communism and left-wing. May as well brainwash them into thinking the rich are the best of the best: clever, intelligent, successful. America is such a wonderful country because it is a meritocracy! If you work hard you will be rewarded!\nMeanwhile a lot of (worker) rights and privileges were dialed back, the mental healthcare industry was all but dismantled and since the elites slowly bought the government and every politician in it the people became expected to serve the elites running the government. It's a job that took 5 decades to get the results they wanted, but by the gods did they succeed. Most Americans are brainwashed to believe all they live for is to work. Even teenagers are expected to essentially slave their youth away after school in order to \"teach them responsibility and work ethics.\" Read: to allow for child labour in 'legal' ways.\nWhy do I know all this? I view America as a warning for Europe. Slowly but surely our own governments are ever so carefully trying to chip away at our rights. American businesses are also trying to get a foothold in our countries and with them they bring American attitudes. The tipping culture being introduced in our fastfood and coffee industry is just one example.'"
