        "In response to 'PF is kinda wild for taking 10. An unchained rogue can get multiple talents that allow them to take 10 in ANY situation, including combat etc.\nI lazily built a lvl 11 npc to join a party (under their combat control) and I had to do a quadruple take when I found out she can basically always runs around with a 40 stealth result if just takes 10. While still doing pretty good combat damage. PF is something else', a user said: 'In 3.5/pf skill checks were really easy to optimize to the point you never failed. You could get a plus 15 to a skill item fairly easily, you had up to lvl plus 3 ranks if a skill if fully invested.'",
        "In response to '\"Taking 10\" and \"taking 20\" are rules used in an old edition.\nTaking 10 is effectively what passive perception is, but for any and all skills. It is intended to be used when the character is attempting a task that a) there's no intense time restraints/initiative and b) have no direct downsides to failure. It fixes the player just rolling again and again until they succeed on a roll they can conceivably just repeat.\nTaking 20 is the version for when they character conceivably has plenty of time to roll again and again until a 20 is rolled with absolutely no downsides to failure to failing or trying again. So they just take the time and are assumed to have gotten a maximum result.', a user said: 'You actually could take 10 regardless of failure consequences. It just required you not be threatened or distracted.'",
        "In response to 'Different editions anyways, but in 3.5 taking 10/20 had specific times attached, so being able to do so in an action would still be valuable.', a user said: 'Taking 20 did, taking 10 didnâ€™t take extra time and could be done as long as not distracted or threatened. Even if failure mattered.'"
