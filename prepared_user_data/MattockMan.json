        "In response to 'Original Post: Where Are the Workers? From Great Resignation to Quiet Quitting [External Link]: https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2023/09/27/where-are-the-workers-from-great-resignation-to-quiet-quitting', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is a bs moniker made up by the capitalistic bootlickers. Doing your job within the scope of your job duties and not going beyond that is in no way an act of quitting. The capitalists are just so used to being in a power imbalance with the workforce that they now expect everyone to devote all of their life energy to the betterment of their shareholders profits. Sounds like the capitalists have a major case of entitlement disease. Whomever still uses this terminology is perpetuating a myth.'",
        "In response to 'I honestly disagree. I feel like a lot of people want 100% pay for 70% work.  Not all ppl. But some.', a user said: 'Since we are in a sub dedicated to economics, I must point out that is what they are supposed to want. In the capitalists model, those workers are being hyper efficient. They are minimizing the labor input they put in for the pay benefit they receive. Are they supposed to do otherwise? As long as they don't get fired or put on probation, etc, it is in their self interest to do as little as possible. You might make the argument that they will receive more future pay if they do more by advancement but nowadays most make more gains by switching employers than do by internal advancement.'"
