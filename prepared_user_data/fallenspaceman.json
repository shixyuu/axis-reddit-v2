        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'I think this quote from the 90s documentary Office Space  sums this up perfectly:\n\"My only real motivation is not to be hassled, that and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired.\"\nI'm not terribly ambitious, which is a mortal sin in Singapore as far as relationships and work is concerned, so I keep it on the down low. I'm working to get money so I can do things I actually enjoy, work is a means to an end basically. I don't know why people demonise a lack of ambition and want to worship the nine-to-six slog. Fuck that noise.'"
