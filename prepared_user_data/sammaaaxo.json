        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didnâ€™t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didnâ€™t have to dishes as often, didnâ€™t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldnâ€™t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didnâ€™t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'Walmart plus is awesome! I havenâ€™t step foot into a grocery store in probably 6 months ðŸ˜³ itâ€™s $12 a month but free delivery, free shipping and a couple free extras. If you have any sort of state benefits you get it for $6 a month. I used to use instacart and it got way too expensive. I feel the prices are comparable to in store unlike instacart which has a clear price difference.\nYou just have to make sure that when your order is being shopped for youâ€™re glued to your phone because they give you like .5 seconds to approve or deny a substitution ðŸ¤£\nAlso please donâ€™t shame me but we use paper and plastic tableware for just about everything. Dishes is the bane of my existence and we donâ€™t have a dishwasher'"
