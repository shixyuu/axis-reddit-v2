But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'There's more to life than the rat race. But Singapore is literally a tiny \"country\" with no natural resources. We are still a \"country\" because we literally work like crazy. I think there is more to life than the rat race, but lying flat ain't it.\nSuggested Solution : move overseas if you have the ability to, to a country that is bigger without Singapore's constant existential crisis. Move to a slower pace of life and start exploring, and living.'"
