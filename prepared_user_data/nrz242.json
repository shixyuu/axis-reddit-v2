        "In response to '\"minimum required\"-doing everything in your job description that you're paid to do. Mainstream media really dogpiling on the idea that anyone not doing more than you're paid to do and were hired for should be fired. Absolutely insane that doing your job is now considered an offense to your employer.', a user said: 'I think it's a weird little leftover from the mid 2000s. People lost a lot in the housing crash and many had to really \"shine\" to keep their careers. And business owners and managers got really used to feeling needed. My last boss just about had a seizure when nobody over 21 applied to her retail manager post on indeed when she offered $19/her and she actually said - out loud - \"It's like they dont even NEED to try to impress us anymore!!\" That's where it finally clicked for me and I was like, yeah I DONT need to impress you - I need to impress people who can afford me! And now I dont work for her and  I make A LOT more money.'"
