        "In response to 'This and to be a “team player” offer to kindly swap out task A for task B.\nI have time to “sweep the floor” or “wash the windows”. I only have two feet and two hands.\nIs it more important that the floor is swept, or the windows washed? I want to help out, please let me know which would benefit the company most.\nBefore I used to say: Sure I’ll stay late and “wash the windows”.\nNow it is I’m “sweeping the floor” today until you tell me to stop doing that and start “washing the windows”.\nMake it clear that you can’t do both at the same time and if you want them done at the same time, you better hire more staff!', a user said: 'This is what I did when my last employer kept piling work on my plate.   I asked my boss to prioritize my workload and stopped doing everything after #3.'"
