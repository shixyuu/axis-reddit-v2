        "In response to '\"Quiet quitting\" is acting your wage. I am paid to do specific functions at work. Once I complete those functions, I have no incentive to do more than what I am paid to do. It's that simple.\nWhy should I do more? I'm constantly being shown that any company has no loyalty to their employees. Employees want better wages and working conditions, so they try to organize and form a union. The company retaliates and closes the location, effectively firing the employees without actually firing them - thus skirting union busting laws. Companies have seminars or webinars discussing how employees can do more for their employer, but never the other way around. Companies cut every corner they can to steal wages from their employees to instead line their own pockets.\nSo no. I'll do what I'm paid to do, and nothing more.', a user said: 'It shouldn't be called quitting if that's the case. Leaving the job has nothing to do with the definition. Quitting is a misnomer.'"
