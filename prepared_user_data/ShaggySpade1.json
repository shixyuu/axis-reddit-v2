Really fucked me over because I was moving out of state and needed that month's income for moving expenses. Never again.', a user said: 'That's why you only give notice when you can quit without. If I give notice I usually have at least two months pay saved, not to mention my Roth IRA, my dividend stock, and the one thousand dollars I keep in a lock box in my safe.\nAlso buy used when you can new cars are a tax on idiots, and unsavy mechanics. (I also follow the ten percent rule, save and invest 10% of all I earn plus bonuses)'"
