Living dangerously over here.', a user said: 'The things that I think make it worth it are:\n— apt complexes can tow you for having no or expired tags and I think it’s been pretty much proven that a lot of apts have relationships with these scummy ass towing companies\n— if you’re pulled over by police they won’t let you drive off they can tow your (car depending on where you park when you get pulled over) /// they won’t let you drive off because without tags you’re not street legal\nThese two things are enough of an inconvenience (and expensive let’s be honest) that I personally would keep my registration up to date .. yes I do let it expire for a while but I think my point is if it’s expired by 3 years? That’s a conscious thing not a “whoops slipped my mind officer please give me a warning!” situation lmao\nYou do you tho! But also if anyone’s reading this and doesn’t have car insurance fuck u'"
