        "In response to 'I honestly think that his whole inner being, that primal self which sets off alarm bells when one is setting on a questionable path, knows that this entrenchment is not a way of life.\nThis entrenchment is instead an orchestrated distraction, something that insulates and protects him from feeling the raw unblemished pain from the full awareness that he is completely disconnected from the way of life which he desperately craves and wholesomely wants.\nThe silent comment at the friend's wedding was everything but a silent one. It was him crying out in pain, in a fleeting moment of clarity.\nHow dare I assume to know so much about his inner state when I've never even met him? Because I too lived such a life.', a user said: 'I saw a tiktok that says the most miserable people are those who are super lazy but very ambitious.

        "In response to 'I wrote a long-ass comment about the lying flat movement, but I was not happy with its overall tone, so I will write my new one simply.\nSingapore’s geopolitical survival is based on the overall productivity of its people. “Productivity,” here, means “how much are you working to earn your wage.” On a personal level, you can be either spendthrift or simply thrifty, but the Government is more interested in ensuring you earn high wages so that they can tax you sensibly, whether it is through your income tax, or the GST.\nLying flat—or, in my interpretation of it, going into NEET mode—is akin to riding a motorcycle without a helmet. Without saving enough to ensure you meet both your current and future needs, you will only harm yourself in the long run. Prospective employers looked at your gap in between your last place of employment and now, and will ask questions you might find difficulty answering (depending on whether you can be truthful in your answers or otherwise).\nAs a matter of public policy, the lying flat movement is borderline “unacceptable.”\nThe nature of Singapore’s economy is this: you need to earn high enough so that the government can tax you enough, and you can spend that cash however you want, so that there’s businesses for other people and companies to earn revenue on. This system of wanting to keep the cash flowing\nall the time\n, is the hallmark of our global economy: trade deficits happened because countries import more than they export, and so needs its people productive (i.e. “keep working”) in order for that cash to flow, and pass on the trade deficit elsewhere.\nIf a large number of Singaporeans, hypothetically, stop work in a show of solidarity with the “lie flat” movement, there are few possible outcomes:\nThe Government is forced to make populist concessions at the risk of blunting our already-blunt productivity indicators (we are not spending more on tax relief & attract more companies to our shores).\nThe Government rebuilds its public policy to favour more immigrant workforce to integrate with Singapore (the unspoken doomsday view: “replace you as a native citizen who, in their minds, have become unproductive and irrelevant to their current power structures”).\nMake “lying flat” illegal (just as how the CCP bans the term on Baidu, Weibo and all of its home-grown social network services) and enforce stricter penalties for promoting it.\nDo nothing. (The doomsday view: “You die, I die, everybody die!”)\nI, in my opinion, favour the movement as a reaction to\nr/LateStageCapitalism\n, however, I lived in a country where there are no natural resources we can capitalise so that we can pursue these personal freedoms of ours without having the daily costs of living becoming overbearing on us. Cue in your usual Social Studies textbook examples of welfarism in Great Britain causing their economy to tank, yada yada yada.', a user said: 'Conversely, I don't think Singapore actually \"rewards\" hard work. We work one of the longest hours in the world but don't have OT pay for white collar workers while businesses are overwhelmingly protected in policy. So large swaths of the population are trapped here bc they don't have the privilege accorded to leave for greener pastures and they don't see wage increases unless they job hop. This is so common that employers are now feeling the brunt of market forces for the first time in a long time (can't hire bc pay is too low).\nFunnily enough for all the flak that Grab delivery get, its still one of the few gigs with a low barrier of entry and actually rewards effort better than most FT jobs. Even in the gig economy, many people want to start their own hustle. Its also more and more common for people to bundle 2-3 hustles instead of 1 proper FT job. Why waste my life for some employer that doesn't reward OT?\nI agree that \"lying flat\" isn't sustainable for a vast majority of us people who do need to work. But I've been doing \"quiet quitting\" for a while and its simply more rewarding.'"
