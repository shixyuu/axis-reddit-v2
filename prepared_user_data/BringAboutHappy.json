What's wrong with just fulfilling the terms of my employment contract, the exact same way my employer only fulfills theirs?', a user said: 'Absolutely! So, by doing the job outlined in my job description isn’t enough? If employer wanted more, then why not hire me with a more thorough job description and properly compensate me?\nBasically it seems as though employers are just pissed they aren’t able to guilt people into doing more work for the same shitty pay they’ve always had.\nEmployers, it’s time to step up your game! Stop taking advantage of your work force and properly compensate people for their efforts.'",
        "In response to 'Yes! And my personal experience with it was I went above and beyond for two years and got no appreciation. I was prepared to leave but had trouble finding a new job, so I just stayed and did the bare minimum. Turns out my job was not stressful when I did that.\nAnd doing only my job description meant I could do it really well, and still have a full life outside work. It worked out well for me. I think it should be called \"drawing boundaries and creating a healthy work life balance\"', a user said: 'I think it should be called \"drawing boundaries and creating a healthy work life balance\"\nBINGO! That’s it.\nGlad to hear you were able to find your job less stressful by sticking to the job description!'"
