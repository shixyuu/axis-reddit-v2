        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'Regardless of all this guys, I think it’s beneficial for YOURSELF to strive and give 100% to anything you do.  Strive for excellence within yourself no matter what others do around you.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Well said :). I also think people look for things to blame as to why they notice they don’t do much in their job.  Blame anything but themselves (boss, money) and just complain in general.\nIt’s a little bit like with games, they get scored on and they try to blame someone else instead of asking the question, what could I have done better?\nAlthough I do understand some jobs can be extremely underwhelming with really bad bosses along with bad pay/team.  A job they really just dislike.  If they are able I would urge them to try find something better if they are able.'"
