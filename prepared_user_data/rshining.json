        "In response to 'Original Post: The Flipside of \"quiet quitting\" is quiet paying. Don't forget this. Somebody older I know asked me why young people are \"quiet quitting\" their jobs and not trying to work hard. I told them that quiet quitting is a bullshit term that describes doing what was outlined in your contract, and not more. He started to tell me how you need to hustle and do more than the minimum if you want to succeed. I told him that the difference compared to many years ago is that now hard work is not met with commensurate rewards or opportunities. Then I asked him the following question:\nIf it is culturally acceptable to push people to go above and beyond what is outlined in their contract, why does the company always only pays what was agreed upon? Why doesn't payroll ever go above and beyond what was agreed? Shouldn't it also be culturally acceptable to expect extra salary in this case? Aren't my company quiet paying me?\nHe had nothing to say and just looked uncomfortable. He didn't really agree but he has no good answer either.', a user said: 'When I was 14, 15 & 16, I worked at a hot dog stand.  My boss paid us (all teens) cash out of the register.  If he came by and someone had done something above-and-beyond, he'd go buy them ice cream, or hand them an extra $20.  After particularly busy weekends he'd take us out to eat AND hand us extra cash.  He bought cases of drinks and a mini fridge for employee use only.  He closed for a holiday and took the entire crew to the beach (included breakfast at his house and meals all day, plus spending money).\nThat's the last boss I have had who was right at my elbow to fairly compensate me for extra effort.  I knew that if I took on a crappy task, I would see a decent reward.  I'd still work for him 30+ years later if I could, because he was a good boss who knew the value of every employee and was ready to pay us for doing jobs that he didn't want to do himself.'"
