Seriously, how sexist can you be? Most women can’t be SAHM’s because of the economy anyway! We have every right to work doing the same jobs as men. I have a good friend who’s a pipe fitter!! I worked in a male-dominated field and was very successful at beating all of them in sales contests. Plus, men get overworked the same as women. How about instead of complaining about men being overworked you give your employees reasonable hours and expectations!'"
