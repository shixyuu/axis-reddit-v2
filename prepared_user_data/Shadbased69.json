        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Sure you donâ€™t\nhave\nto call, but itâ€™s probably the nice thing to do, and itâ€™s not that much of an additional hassle. Sending one text and waiting out the timer is not the most reasonable approach (in all that time you couldnâ€™t have called once?). To me it looks like you went out of your way to be extra rude to a random person (but theyâ€™re supposedly the Karen?) and steal their food.'"
