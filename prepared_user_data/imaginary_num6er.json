You work your ass off and you only get like a 3-5% wage increase and once you are promoted, you are given more work to do without getting much increase in pay.\nSome view the young people who are \"quiet quitting\" to be the smarter ones, where they reached the same enlightenment that many reached in their mid-years of working less is better.'"
