I do screenshot my call log and send it to door dash when disputes happen regarding my attempts to reach a customer.', a user said: 'Some real teenager of genius said, \"i let somebody else have my phone\" after I asked him why he didn't answer my calls or messages (hotel lobby delivery)...I said, \"Yeah I'm not buying that, like you let someone else possess your $600 phone, but whatever it's alright have a good one\"'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Anyone else try to reach a customer by phone and a fake AI voice answers in half second after you dial and it's almost coherent but it ends up laughing and just saying hello? hello? hello?\nHad that weirdness happen the other night'"
