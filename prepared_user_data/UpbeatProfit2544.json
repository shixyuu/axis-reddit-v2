        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'This is why I always plan in a few rest days where I just sit in my room pretty much. Usually right at the beginning and end of my trip. Honestly, those are some of my best travel days, too. Travel burn out is real!\nOne of my most memorable days in Iceland was spent mostly hanging out in my room, reading, and walking to a public pool a block away from my hotel that was honestly just as nice as any of the expensive tourist hot springs and a cool cultural experience.\nBut there is no shame in just quitting either, travel is exhausting.'"
