        "In response to 'How on earth does one completely change industries like this? My bachelor's degree is in Human Resource Development. But all of my professional experience is human services (nonprofit, substance use & mental health response.) I am 37 and don't see a way to get into human resources. I've applied for a couple HR jobs and even the ones that are assistant jobs, that don't even require a college degree (I have 4, 3 associate's and a bachelor's) will not hire me.', a user said: 'Talk to your boss about a lateral move within your company to the HR department. If you donâ€™t have a big enough HR department where you are now, chose your next position at a company with an HR department large enough that you can apply for internal positions when they open up. Think bank headquarters. Part of working somewhere and being loyal should be the opportunity to pursue new or reinvigorating positions within the company.'"
