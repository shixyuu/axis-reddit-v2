        "In response to 'Most workers, even tech workers, didn't have pagers and the lack of cell phones meant that calling in wasn't always possible anyway.\nI do agree that this has been a steady erosion, but it didn't apply to most workers until recently.', a user said: 'My job wanted me to download their app for \"ease of use\" and other BS stuff. I worked for years without it, nothing changed, so I don't need it now.\nI told them I had no room but if they bought me a work phone I'd happily put the app on it. Of course they then told me to come into the office for a tech guy to check my phone for space instead.\nI put a whole bunch of apps I'd never use in every nook and cranny. Got them to drop it after a few weeks.'"
