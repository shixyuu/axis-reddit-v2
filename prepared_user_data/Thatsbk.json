        "In response to 'Original Post: How’s this for quiet quitting? I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'You do you, i guess.\nBut honestly, why the fuck are you posting this on Reddit?'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'I cant get shit done while im in the office.\nI am not a fucking child. I am tired of being treated like one. The CEO of my company can choke on a fucking dick.'"
