        "In response to 'The issue with it, to me, is that they’re saying meeting the requirements of your job is akin to not doing your job at all.\nIt’s not quitting to do just what needs to be done without going above and beyond. Or to have healthy boundaries between work and life. The word “quitting” has no business being assigned to real people doing real labor.\nIt reminds me of those sayings like, “If you’re not 15 minutes early, you’re late,” or “I need you to give 110%.” They’re manipulative ways of making people feel like meeting expectations is already failure.\n“Quiet quitting” describes a very healthy, admirable worker behavior in terms of how the employer sees it—that they’re being robbed of something. When in reality, people are just not playing these stupid games anymore. But the language is cleverly designed to set the bar in favor of the employer, and make anything less than above-and-beyond sound like not good enough.', a user said: 'If you’re not 15 minutes early, you’re late\nI prefer, \"If I'm not 15 minutes late, I'm on time.\"\nYeah, I'll bet you do.\nI just told you I do. No wager required. My take is equally as valid as yours unless you feel it's your prerogative to steal from employees.'"
