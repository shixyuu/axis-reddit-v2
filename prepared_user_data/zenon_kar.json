        "In response to 'NEVER:\nVolunteer for anything\nDo extra work outside your jobscope\nFinish work ahead of schedule\nOffer novel solutions that you can profit on your own (e.g. new code, software, inventions)\nTell your boss/colleagues about your shortcuts, tricks and efficiency ways.\nWHY?\nBecause the company will raise your workload and put higher expectations but with no increase in pay.', a user said: 'It is crazy that every time I have upped my performance I have been told in direct terms on my review even “this is the new baseline” well shit okay'",
        "In response to 'It's not\nresigning\nquitting, but it does feel like\ngiving up\nquitting.  But if you feel like your advancement in your company isn't based on your performance, then why overperform?  Then again, I suppose some people are content with their current positions, so, again, they have no need to overperform.', a user said: 'Yeah I mean as long as someone is okay where they’re at, not sure why they’d want to do more. Seems like you’re ripping yourself off'",
        "In response to 'i still think it is bullshit- \"you're the boss, you give me tasks to do.  if you want me to do something else, we can renegotiate.\"\nacting your wage is just another cutesy bullshit term to once again place blame on the worker, as if they aren't trying hard enough to maximize their owner's wealth.  you wanna be the boss, be the boss.  don't blame somebody else because you're not a good enough leader.', a user said: 'I agree'"
