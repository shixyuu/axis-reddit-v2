        "In response to 'Reframe your decision into. \" I’m done overachieving and stressing literally ruining my health over these studpid experiements and it doesn't even help\"\nAnd take a step back. Prefereably take a week completely off (PTO/holidays) and then stop over-archieving. \"Quiet quitting\" has such a negative ring, but moving back to 35 hours a week (7h days + 1h of sport/walk/nap every afternoon) to take care of your health can be an amazing decision. And you might find that if you are dedicated to use this free time to take care of your health you might even be more productive in this 35h than in whatever you worked before.\nGood luck, and hope you feel better soon!', a user said: 'This'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: I’m quiet quitting my PhD I’m over stressing about it. None of this matters anyway. My experiment failed? It’s on my advisor to think about what I can do to still get this degree. I’m done overachieving and stressing literally ruining my health over this stupid degree that doesn’t matter anyway. Fuck it and fuck academia! I want to do something that makes me happy in the future and it’s clear academia is NOT IT!\nEdit: wow this post popped off. And I feel the need to address some things.\n1. I am not going to sit back and do nothing for the rest of my PhD. I’m going to do the reasonable minimum amount of work necessary to finish my dissertation and no more. Others in my lab are not applying for as many grants or extracurricular positions as I am, and I’m tired of trying to go the extra mile to “look good”. It’s too much.\n2. Some of yall don’t understand what a failed fieldwork experiment looks like. A ton of physical work, far away from home and everyone you know for months, and at the end of the day you get no data. No data cannot be published. And then if you want to try repeating it you need to wait another YEAR for the next season.\n3. Yes I do have some mental and physical health issues that have been exacerbated by doing this PhD, which is why I want to finish it and never look back. I am absolutely burnt out.', a user said: 'Try reading slow productivity by cal Newport. The tldr there is: allow your work to take longer time don’t rush it, say no to more things, focus on quality and deep work, allow for time off. \nThis approach is especially effective for academic work where doing the right thing for 5 hours can have more impact than doing the wrong thing for 40 hours'"
