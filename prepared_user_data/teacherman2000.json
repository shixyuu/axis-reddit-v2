        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'I used to plan when kids were doing independent work. I would grade when kids were doing independent work. And if I got behind on grading everybody got a hundred for turning it in. It is what it is. We changed the world by being there for kids and showing kids that we care. We Don't change the world by grading every single answer.'"
