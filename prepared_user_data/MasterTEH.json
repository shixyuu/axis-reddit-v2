        "In response to 'I’ve officially ‘quiet quit’ for 2 years now, and I still get recognition points, and the regular pat on the back. I do maybe 8 hours of actual work per week tops. I’m a manager, so I give my team time and space to do what they need and pick their own deadlines. I give absolutely no shit about anything at work. I leave most days at 3pm and no one has picked up on it. I thought I would have been fired or made redundant months ago - but alas, if the work is done, no one cares\nMaybe once every 2 months there’s some mediocre emergency which requires me to work a full couple of day - but I’ve only worked past 5pm once in 2 years. I’m at a big bank.\nPlease - don’t kill your selves at work. It ruins it for us lazy people', a user said: 'That's actually great management, let the people who do the work get on with it, most people are trying to do a good job. re KPIs annual reviews and team building cringe just destroy motivation.'"
