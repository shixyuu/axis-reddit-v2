Don’t be a piece of shit and honor your end of the agreement you make.', a user said: 'Nope it’s not a time trade at all (at least for salaried employees, which most people in here are). It’s\nresults\nbased. If I can deliver the results that the company is looking for, and the company is satisfied with those results, it doesn’t matter if I do it in 40 hours or 15 hours. It’s the company’s job to have enough work for me to do to fill up 40 hours of time. And I’m not going to volunteer more of my time for no more pay. The same people who say “they are paying you for 40 hours!” have no problem when an employer makes you work 50 or 60 hours for no extra money.\nI get up every day and do good work, and deliver exactly what my employers ask for. And I use the time I have left to do the same with multiple other employers.'"
