Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'We know the vast majority of companies pay only the absolute minimum that they can get away with. Why do employees working the absolute minimum that they can get away with are given a derogatory term?\nIf working only as much as they pay you is called “quiet quitting”, wouldn’t the company paying only as much as you work be called “quiet firing”?'"
