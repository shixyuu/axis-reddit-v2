        "In response to '“Quiet quitting” is idiot boomer speak and every time I hear it I want to drink a gallon of bleach', a user said: 'It's an astroturfed term for sure. It really just means \"\nwork to rule\n\", but reworded to make it look\nbad\nthat you refuse to do unpaid overtime. Because the accepted default is that you have to constantly give \"above and beyond\" what your employer is willing to compensate you with; anything that questions that dogma has to be disciplined by media and culture.'",
        "In response to '\"you only pay me enough not to quit so I only work enough not to get fired\"! I thought this was an age old rule as far as I can remember nothing new haha', a user said: 'You would be correct. Hence the new terminology; any time labor starts to gain an advantage, the powers of capital must rally around ways to put pressure back on labor. These days you can't just accuse someone of being communist, and labor unions are all but defanged, so they have to come up with new scare tactics.'"
