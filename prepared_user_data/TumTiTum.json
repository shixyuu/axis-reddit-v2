        "In response to 'I think it seems a shame that ‘quiet quitting’ caught on as the new slogan, I’ve seen ‘act your wage’ floating around and think that’s much more representative \nAnd from what I’ve read, ‘work to rule’ is a collective and purposeful action, whereas this is more of a general philosophy trying to counteract the current culture of workers being pushed to the very ends of what they can be convinced to do', a user said: 'Act your wage sounds more sensible.  I can totally understand someone working a minimum wage manual job doing the minimum.  Someone in a position of significant responsibility, with a significant wage to support those responsibilities, doing the bare minimum and sticking rigidly to their hours to the detriment of co-workers and the company doesn't sit so well.\nGiven that most have to spend a large proportion of their time at work, I wonder how healthy it is to do that work with the approach of \"I've turned up, that's all I have to do\" rather than being more enthused about a project/development/progression.\nIts not for me, but I'm lucky enough to work for decent folk.  If I didn't I'd be looking to move rather than stagnate.'"
