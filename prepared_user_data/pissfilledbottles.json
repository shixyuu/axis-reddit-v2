        "In response to 'I’m happy to go above and beyond for managers willing to do the same for me, but I’ve wasted enough years toiling under people who wanted to squeeze me dry while insisting they couldn’t afford to pay me better. If the boss makes it clear there’s no reward for working hard, then I’m just working hard enough to not get fired.', a user said: 'Yep. I honestly thought the abuse was just part of the work environment. Every job I've had until the one I have now has been like an abusive relationship.\nThe job I'm at now, I come in, do what they hired me to do, and go home. I work Monday through Friday, that's it. There is travel, and you typically work Saturdays if you're traveling, but they usually pay you a full day for half a days work, so I'm not upset about it. If I have to take a day off for whatever reason, I'm not guilted about it. I'm not having anxiety about going to work anymore, sure I dread it sometimes, but I never have near panic attacks like I used to.\nAll my other jobs have always been customer service type jobs, and in my 20 years working, this is my first desk job. I've definitely had to adapt to sitting at a desk most of the day, but I love it. I put my earbuds in, throw on something to listen to, and get lost in autocad doing my work.'"
