        "In response to 'I mean, when I lived in Japan \"work ethic\" meant you have to leave later than your boss. It didn't mean you had to do work, just look busy. That's basically the \"quiet quitting\" bullshit the media made up to shame people for doing their jobs, and my coworkers were doing that decades ago. It sounds like nothing's changed they just wrote a scolding article about it.', a user said: '100% this, I lived there 12 years and the hard work has been a myth for decades.\nEven at Japan's top investment bank people sleep at their desk and do nothing until about 5pm when they suddenly start making themselves busy so they can show how diligent they are working until last train.\nAnother key factor is how many have utterly dysfunctional marriages where they literally don't want to go home.'",
        "In response to 'Staying at the office until some stupid hour of the night seems like a fast track to a dysfunctional marriage', a user said: 'I'd say the two things act in a form of symbiosis.'",
        "In response to 'I heard that some wives consider a good husband one who is never home.\nNo clue if that's just boomer-humour style comments or something actually considered when looking for a spouse.', a user said: 'It's definitely a thing with some people, I suspected it's mostly passed down behaviour from parents'"
