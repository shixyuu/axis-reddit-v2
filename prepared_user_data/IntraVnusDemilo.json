And let me tell you, daddy wouldn't have gave me that job if he thought that his special guy was lazy like you lot.', a user said: 'Lol, you got me with that first bit! Haha.'",
        "In response to 'I used to give 110% to jobs, be really conscientious, work extra hours, be so friendly towards colleagues and got nothing to show for it. The more you care, the more you can be burned imo.\nNow I look upon it as a transaction. I sell my time, they pay me for it. I switch off my computer on the dot and I leave. I don't slack exactly but if they want more out of me, they should pay me more.\nAnd to be quite honest, if I didn't need to work to afford basic necessities such as food, clothes, a roof over my head, I wouldn't work at all. I laugh when people say \"oh if I won the lottery I couldn't give up working\"- I'd be out the door as soon as I could. Wouldn't even work my notice!', a user said: 'Yeah, same if I won the lottery. Might not even bother telling them, just don't bother going back.'"
