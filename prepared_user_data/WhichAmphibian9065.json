        "In response to 'Much to my surprise, I’ve started to enjoy grocery shopping (alone). I go to the “fancy” grocery store and get a little coffee while there. I like picking out what I want and focusing on health/simple. So protein, grain, veggies and fruits as snacks. I use Meal Lime and it categorizes everything.\nMy husband is great at it but he gets “whatever is on sale” and the same old things. I’m pescatarian and so that makes it tricky. I’m starting to cook more and finding that roasted veggies with seasoning are the easiest thing and the kiddo loves them.', a user said: 'Omg same I love grocery shopping alone, with my headphones in, taking my time looking at everything with a fancy coffee in hand, no one asking me for anything 😂'"
