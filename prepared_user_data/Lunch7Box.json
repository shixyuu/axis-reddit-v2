Not sure what your minimum wage is now but I make over 10 dollars over that here. Yet I still see people act like Walmart hasn't raised our wages at all. If you ask me, ya'll just don't want to work hard, which is fine. But just say that... And no, I'm not a bootlicker and I share the same gripes about this company as most, but pay has over doubled for almost every non-salaried position in the company in the last 5 years.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I don't have to... they're not related at all. Walmart is shitty but stop acting like they haven't raised the wages at all. Simple as that. 7.25 an hour and you guys wanted 15. Now it's 15 min across the board and now it's 20+. You got what you wanted, at this point it comes off as an excuse to be lazy. Look at my posts, I'm far from a Walmart supporter lol.'"
