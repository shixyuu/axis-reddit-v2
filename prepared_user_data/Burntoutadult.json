        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I hate this term so much. I do my job within the job parameters.  I am so tired of going above and beyond for stagnant wages, shitty vacay time and benefits.  I work in a place now that thinks social outings are a \"perk\".  How is me driving 2 hours, having to find a sitter, after hours - giving up my valuable free time a perk??  Just pay me what my 20 years of experience are worth.'"
