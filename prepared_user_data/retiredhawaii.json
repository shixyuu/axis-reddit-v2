        "In response to 'My company is transitioning to performance based bonuses after 70 years of a set bonus that’s part of your compensation package at hiring. All of our job descriptions were re-written to include every extra task we do or have ever done, and the “performance evaluation ” for earning your (exact same) bonus now includes doing extra work, taking on extra training, extra education (at our own expense); seeking opportunities to take on more tasks and responsibilities, regularly “checking in” with your manager about your output & quantifiable ways you are trying to improve it, etc. And they’re branding this as a way of “rewarding” higher achieving employees. We are required to track all of this weekly also. It’s absolutely a measure they’re taking to weed out quiet quitting or justify layoffs, and they think we don’t know that. 🙄', a user said: 'Track your time spent tracking your time. It’s legitimate time away from doing what actually matters to the company.'"
