        "In response to 'Thereâ€™s a special place in hell for teachers who do that extra work for free', a user said: 'I'm currently out of teaching but I taught English in a low income area where most students had never been taught how to read properly. I put in 60+ hours nearly every week because I wanted to do everything I could to give them a fighting chance and I allowed lots of late assignments/makeup work because many of them were working long hours after school to help support their families. I wasnt able to do all of that that in the amount of time I was paid for so yeah, I worked for free. In NC too, where we make 38k a year.\nI guess I belong in hell for that though. Why should I have cared for some of the most disadvantaged teenagers in the country when I should have been considering the feelings of my coworkers?\nI left my job not long after I found out one of my coworkers refused to give a student an extension on an important project after her brother died. I thought we were supposed to be helping, not gatekeeping. I guess I was wrong. But yes, you're right, I should be in hell for that.'"
