        "In response to 'Gen Xers were the first gen to get screwed by boomers. In the 90s, the term \"Gen X\" was synonymous with being a POS. When we were kids, they had us raise ourselves & when we came of age, they undermined, gaslit, & swindled us.\nAlso, we had phones, lol', a user said: 'Gen Xers were the first gen to get screwed by boomers.\n\"The boomers are going to be retiring soon, and then all these wonderful job opportunities are going to open up!\"\nThey've been feeding that to us since I went to college in the 90s. Who would have thought that boomers would love hustling so much that they'd choose to do it until they die?'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing. They just called it “mailing it in” and the movie Office Space is a commentary on this.', a user said: 'Let's be honest, \"Doing the bare minimum, as outlined in your job description\" is not a revolutionary concept.'",
        "In response to 'Gen X called it ‘working to rule’', a user said: 'Correction: \"working to rule\" is what unions call it when they choose to do it instead of going on strike.'"
