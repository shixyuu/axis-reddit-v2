        "In response to 'Original Post: Got my boomer parents to say I should quiet quit. So I started a new job 8 days, 6 business day, ago. This is CapitalOne, by the way. Today, my HR manager gives me a call and tells me that I can either take a 25% pay cut or leave my job. I'm not even done onboarding yet, as they want me to watch nearly 40h of trainings along with applying for all my permissions without telling me what they are. On top of that, this was always meant to be a hold-me-over type of jobs, as I already took about a 30% pay cut for this job, but I had been unemployed for nearly a year, and wanted to stop bleeding money. And so I talked afterwards, in private, to some of my team members, and apparently this is just normal behavior for the company.\nMy parents gave me a call for the holidays after work. They asked me how the new job was going, and I told them about it. Both my parents are avid Fox News watcher, and had been complaining about the \"quiet quitting epidemic\" for sometime. My dad, was like, oh you should quit and find a better opportunity, but my mom interrupted my dad and told me that I should \"Take the offer, look for a new job, and do the bare minimum at my current position\". I informed her that, that is literally \"quiet quitting\", and she without missing a beat told me to \"quiet quit\" and my dad soon followed suit.\nMy parents might be pushing 80, but I'm glad I finally got them to see the light of how messed up our economy is. And I feel very proud about it, prouder than most other things in my life, and I made discoveries in my industry that fundamentally changed it, and you know what, I feel more proud about this, than I do that.', a user said: 'When parents are at the age where they can’t bail us out anymore and they see firsthand what the job market is doing to their own kids, they soften a little because they see our valiant efforts our entire life and witness that we have to work three times as hard as they did to gain the same returns and also be in a position to help them. My parents are from South Dakota and upright Baptists and now politically with Cornel West, their type of Baptist. Relationships are our most valuable asset, and we live in a system designed to prioritize the dollar over healthy relationships. so glad to hear that your parents got the message. Good luck to you and wishing you lots of prosperity! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗🤗'"
