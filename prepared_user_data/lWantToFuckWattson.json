        "In response to 'I don't think most on this sub are anti-work so much as pro worker parity with management. Society needs people to do things, and most of the time they're not enjoyable. The issue is when all the power is with management, it's the people actually doing stuff that suffer. Management has a use, even executives have a use. But the compensation vs. amount of work done/value created is WAY skewed towards an elite class that already has hoarded most of our resources for themselves. Essentially my companies CEO makes thousands of times what I do, but plop him on my lift to load a trailer with product? Workers add the real value, and thus our compensation needs to be reevaluated at a fundamental level. Unions are a huge help with that BTW.', a user said: 'this sub is socialist which means we want the workers to have\nOWNERSHIP\nrather\nparity\nwith a separate ownership class\nunions are just a fun way to fight a thing that shouldn't exist in the first place'"
