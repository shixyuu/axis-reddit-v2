        "In response to 'The rewards for going above and beyond have evaporated, along with the ridiculous expectations that have steadily increased. What was \"exceptional effort\" 40 years ago have been skewed into being the normal expectations, which is fucked up. Especially since wages have stagnated and not kept pace with the prouction output.', a user said: 'The reward for hard work is quite literally limited by payroll/HR. Ever had a yearly performance review? They always have the categories like “met expectations”, “high performer”, “exceptional”. But HR limits how many good rankings they can hand out. What if everyone in the department was exceptional? Too bad - you get one exceptional. That person gets more than the standard raise/bonus that year. Everyone else gets the standard (i.e., less than inflation) raise. It’s grading on a set curve for companies, and it’s dumb as hell. So why would I bust my ass when there’s a chance one other person will also be busting theirs? Or maybe the boss just likes one person a little more than me. Then I’m screwed because I just “met expectations”. I hate it here.'"
