        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'I wouldn't be petty. Grow a spine and be straight up, if you have the proof. Let them know that you need a role that is parallel to what you've been doing.\nSometimes people in the business have many pressures and they can overlook things that are working. You likely do this in your job by putting off things that should be done for things that need to be done.\nYou need to speak up. If they treat you poorly, quit. If they come to the table with a good offer, great. If you have done good work and need to move to greener pasture they can provide recommendations for your good work. If you don't need that, no real reason to burn a bridge when they haven't be purposefully neglectful.'"
