        "In response to 'And it's not like they're not doing anything. They're still doing their work.\nAlways hated the term quiet quitting for that reason. Makes way more sense to apply it to someone actually not doing anything and just waiting to get fired.', a user said: 'If you resign by yourself, you get a temporary block on unemployment insurances. Thats why i really think this term should be applied to these people who slowly on purpose dont do their work to get fired by their employer. Many only resign when they found a job elsewhere or if they really just cant work there anymore due to personal issues at work. For me the term in this thread should be doing the minimum. Not \"quite quitting\"'"
