        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'Look, y’all probably think this is true, but, man I’ve employed people for a long time, and have worked w/ a lot of people from different industries for a long time. Getting paid more is not gonna improve your work ethic. I pay well above industry standard, hell, I pay way more than union wages. Always have. Making sure employees are happy is number 1. Someone w/ no experience at all gets paid well, and there’s room for advancement, and we offer all the insurance you want, which is hard to do in construction bc of such high turnover. When someone needs money to get thru the week bc they went on a bender, we loan it. If someone needs help getting a car to get to work, we’ll give ‘em a loan.\nIt’s hard work, but everyone makes good money. And still, people will still miss a day every week. We have actually offered, on certain jobs, to give whoever shows up every single day a raise. People still won’t do it. I can offer someone a path to make six figures, they won’t take it. Your work ethic is not going to improve w/ more money. Also, construction is absolutely a meritocracy. You show up, bust your ass, you move up. But also, why would I give a raise to someone doing the bare minimum?'"
