        "In response to '\"Minimum required\" is what most employees have done since time immemorial. All of this talk is just bullshit to create a new moral panic.\nI mean. My compensation is the minimum required by the terms of my employment, I don't see how how this shouldn't be the expectation.', a user said: 'I’ve never understood this not being the expectation either. I do the minimum to earn my wage, you pay me the minimum you can in negotiation. We aren’t a family, I’m not seeing a portion of the profits from the business, so why would you expect me to do more if my paycheck isn’t more?'"
