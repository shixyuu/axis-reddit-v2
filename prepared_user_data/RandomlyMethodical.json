He does one good enough, but ultimately shitty weld, then does a beautiful weld that shows his skill and craftsmanship. Then tells the interviewers: the first is what you’ll get from me for $16, the second is $30.\nThis is the reaction of millions of people being taught that raises/promotion requires that extra effort, just for the company to hire from outside instead of promoting within. I will do what I am required and nothing else, unless it benefits a friend/coworker (maybe taking a shorter lunch here and there to help them button up a project). If you want more, I will need to be compensated for more.', a user said: 'There’s an old Dilbert comic strip that I saw posted somewhere recently.\nBoss: “The best I can give you is a 2% raise.”\nDilbert: “No problem. I’ll just lower the quality of my work until the pay feels fair.”'"
