Don't let it become an acceptable term [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/fwj0foce59k91.jpg', a user said: 'This is such a great post. I've been in a labor union for many years. I enjoy better than average wages and benefits that the typical worker in my field.\nI just wanted to add that \"Work to Rule\" can go beyond just working the bare minimum. It can be proactive. Nit picking every aspect of safety regulations is one way to Work to Rule. I drive a work truck and I occasionally work aloft or in dangerous environments. I can always find something that is unsafe to report.\nWhen our union is in conflict with the company, we occasionally deploy \"Work to Rule\" tactics. That means we go over every job with a fine toothed comb looking for safety problems.\nWorn tread on a truck tire? Sorry boss, can't drive 'til that tire is replaced. Broken glass on the job site? Someone's gonna hafta make that safe before I go in there. Do I smell natural gas? Better call the gas company to make sure. There is always a reason to double check safety.'"
