I don’t really care because to be honest expensive doesn’t mean better quality.\nI have enough money to live within my means and I have time to play games, exercise, and read novels that I love.  I live my life as is and I’m happy.\nNot thinking about kids either because that’s whole responsibility I don’t want.  And if people complain about “who’s going to take care of you when you get old?”  No one.  I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m dependent on others to live.  I’ll save up money so I can get euthanasia in another country when I’m getting old.', a user said: 'I’ll save up money so I can get euthanasia in another country when I’m getting old.\nHats off to you sir!'"
