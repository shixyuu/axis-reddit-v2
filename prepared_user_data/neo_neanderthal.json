        "In response to 'Original Post: Reddit was so hot on \"quiet quitting\" but now when you talk about using slowdowns to interfere with the fascist takeover, all you hear is crickets We are at a pivotal moment, where either we choose to plunge the system into darkness on our terms temporarily, or the oligarchs drive the system into darkness on their terms for the foreseeable future.  And yet, so many people seem willing to just continue, business as usual, even as our protections (worker protections, immigrant protections, social services) evaporate before our eyes.\nThe ruling class may own the companies, but the working class still runs them, and we have a chance to use that to help ward off the darkness.', a user said: 'Did it occur to you that people may do \"quiet quitting\"...quietly?\nAlso, I've never liked that term. It's not \"quitting\". It's just me not doing extra work for free. They don't give me extra\npay\nfor free, so why should it work the other way around?'",
        "In response to 'i don't know why it's called \"quiet quitting\"\nit's literally just doing the tasks expected of you.', a user said: 'I don't know what's so hard for them to understand about that. It's true in every other case. If they want more widgets from their widget supplier, they have to pay the widget supplier more money.\nSimilarly, work is a transaction; you pay me a certain amount of money for a certain amount of work. If you want more work, you pay more money. Certainly they don't put extra money in my paycheck every so often just for the hell of it, so why should I give them \"bonus\" work for free?'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I found a case where a company was giving out double credits to customers, and correcting it saved them, by my calculations, over $300k a year. My next raise was under $5k a year.\nYou can guess how long I stuck around after that.'"
