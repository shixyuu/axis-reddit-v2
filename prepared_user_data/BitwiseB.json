The idea being that they’re hoping to get fired so that they can get severance/unemployment, because they don’t actually want to work but they can make more money if they’re fired than if they leave, because the US is weird when it comes to labor.\nYou’d think\nthat\nwould be ‘quiet quitting,’ not\ndoing the job you were hired to do.'"
