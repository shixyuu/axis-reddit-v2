        "In response to '“Quiet Quitting” is corporatespeak for “not working for free”.', a user said: 'We call it “working your wage” here.  Even as a first-level manager, I taught some of my employees this principle and I never held it against them if they chose to implement it.  I was on their side, because I’ve been in their shoes; even in lower-level management (especially in grocery or retail), I wasn’t paid what I should have been, so I also “worked my wage.”  This “QuIeT qUiTtInG” crap needs to stop - it’s not an accurate descriptor at all.  It’s just annoying.'"
