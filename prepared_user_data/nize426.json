        "In response to 'Original Post: New type of quitting discovered \"Quiet quitting is easy to identify; employees who are quiet quitters visibly reduce their effort and avoid going the extra mile. Soft quitting, on the other hand, happens quietly over time. Employees donâ€™t necessarily reduce their work output, but their enthusiasm fades, their curiosity dwindles, and their emotional connection to their work diminishes.\"\nThe cure is to lick the boot harder.', a user said: 'Lololol god damn. What's next?\nEver-so-slightly quitting - When you have enthusiasm, drive, and motivation, but you kind of don't want to do the mandatory training HR assigns everyone.\nIncompetent quitting - when you're a hard worker but you're just bad at it.\nLadder quitting - when you're a good employee but you don't want to become a manager.'"
