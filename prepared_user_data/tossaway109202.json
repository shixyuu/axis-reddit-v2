        "In response to 'Original Post: Homer Simpson (1995) explaining quiet quitting 27 years before people thought quiet quitting was a new thing. [External Link]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYXzHjbfMDk', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is not a new thing at all, it's just a stupid buzz word that is perpetuated by lazy \"journalists\" that are probably quiet quitting.\nThey get to triple dip that chip too. You get \"What is quiet quitting\", \"Why you should be quiet quitting\" and \"Why only losers are quiet quitting\"\nThere will be another stupid buzz word in a few weeks and the cycle repeats. It's all stupid and boring.'"
