        "In response to 'Work-to-rule is a job action in which employees do no more than the minimum required by the rules of their contract, and precisely follow all safety or other regulations, which may cause a slowdown or decrease in productivity, because the employer did not hire enough employees or pay the appropriate salary and as such does not have the requirements needed to run at the level they desire.[1][2] Such an action is considered less disruptive than a strike or lockout, and obeying the rules is less susceptible to disciplinary action. Notable examples have included nurses refusing to answer telephones, teachers refusing to work for free at night and during weekends and holidays, and police officers refusing to issue citations. Refusal to work overtime, travel on duty, or sign up to other tasks requiring employee assent are other manifestations of using work-to-rule as industrial action.\nHas nobody really heard of this before?  Used to happen all the time to TDSB schools in the 00's.', a user said: 'And what's wrong with that? I get paid to do my job, and that's it. If I go out of my way to do something extra, or something thats not in my job description, I dont get paid more. If my job description has added responsibilities, and im compensated for it, I have no problem doing the extra work. The fact that following safety laws and regulations precisely is considered a job action is ridiculous. There is a reason for those laws and regulations, and thats to save lives. No job pays enough for me to risk my life doing it.'",
        "In response to 'In the corporate world its more of a stigma against employees who dont go the 'extra mile' and do overtime and put in more work to get results especially during busy season.\nWhat really bothered me was when my director said I didnt seem dedicated to the company because I seemed to be \"protecting my teams work life balance\" just because I wasnt signing them up to fix one of her other teams incompetence.', a user said: 'Exactly. 2 of the 4 companies I've worked for have consistently understaffed, and relied on the workers to work overtime, or do multiple jobs while paying the minimum they can get away with.'"
