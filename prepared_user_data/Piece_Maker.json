        "In response to 'I would had thought, hearing the phrase, that \"quiet quitting\" would basically be doing half your job until management realise, give you a warning, then 3 months later let you go.', a user said: 'That's exactly what the phrase brings to mind for me too, or even going a step further and doing nothing except clocking in and pretty much just seeing how long you can get away with it until you're sacked.\nAnd that's precisely why it's nothing but anti-worker propaganda IMO. Trying to paint us minimum wage grinders as lazy millennials scamming money out of hard working business owners.'",
        "In response to 'Sarcasm aside, there's a shred of truth behind this. You'll advance less with a \"I come in, do my hours and leave\" attitude if for no other reason than someone else doing\nmore\nwill be favoured for promotions.', a user said: 'Except what usually happens is that you miss out on promotions because they don't want to have to hire someone new to replace the guy who does the work of two people.'",
        "In response to 'Work to rule is generally (as far as I'm aware), a term used to describe a protest. Usually union backed and one step before a strike. Look at avanti rail, its' drivers are working to rule by refusing over time, not actually striking, but seriously fucking with them.', a user said: 'I always thought working to rule was essentially following the rulebook to the letter, exposing inefficiencies usually covered up by workers cutting agreed corners. If you work on a machine that can cut 100 pillowcases an hour, or 150 an hour if you don't bother with the 15 minute quality check your manager trusts you to pass 99% of the time anyway, you can 'work to rule' by reverting to the first option and making sure the higher ups know why your productivity is down 50%'"
