As soon as they cut our ours in winter and we had to work extra in the summer they never said anything and expected me to pay that time back like everyone else. Now I start work when I am meant to, take all of my brakes because I used to skip them to and leave when I am meant to. Fuckers. I don't work too myself too hard anymore either, if I can get a breather or an easy job to do I take it. It's best to do the bare minumum to get by so you don't get into trouble for being too slow but not working more then what is expected because you don't get anything for it.', a user said: 'I’m a pretty efficient worker so I tend to do more than most in the same amount of time. But I found work started getting piled on me because of that. Then I started trying to finish it in my own time but that didn’t really make things easier as the more I do the more I get given so I end up doing 2x as everyone else. So now I just slow down take my time and only work the hours I’m paid.'"
