        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “Quiet quitting” / “Acting your Wage”? [External Link]: /r/AskReddit/comments/xwwzxk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_quiet_quitting_acting/', a user said: 'Look at wage increases vs. executive compensation.\nYou have two options.\nWork hard, go above and beyond, and sacrifice your personal time and sanity, and in the end, you might get a 1-year subscription to the jelly-of-the-month club.\nDo exactly what you're paid to do and not one minute more.\nOne of the few positives that came out of COVID is that it broke a number of people of the corporate propaganda of \"work hard and be rewarded\". People got to take a hard look at what they were doing, especially after said companies booted them to the curb faster than Taco Bell through the colon of someone with IBS.\nNow, with wages not even covering the costs of living people are wondering why the hell should they even bother. The answer, of course, is that they shouldn't. Work hard, and the company makes more money. Are you getting a cut of that? Of course not. The company's responsibility is to the shareholders, not you.\nIn the long long ago you USED to get rewarded for hard work. You USED to get recognized for going above and beyond. Now it is just EXPECTED. Now they expect to call you after work hours. They expect you to come in on weekends. They expect you to cancel your vacations, never be out sick, and so on and so forth.\nSo unless you work for one of the few nice companies that still recognize and incentivize hard work, don't bother with doing anything beyond what you are contractually obligated to do. All you're doing is wrecking your own personal well-being in the name of furthering corporate profits that you will never see.'"
