        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I did that at my last full time sales job before going out on my own.  Management made a change to my pay scale and I mentally checked out.  I knew a big commission check was coming and quit a week after cashing it.  I was hybrid work from home so I got so much done on my house.  I basically redid my kitchen on company time.'"
