It's called boundaries. If I'm not at work, I don't owe you any of my time. If you send an urgent email that you want me to respond to on my day off, sorry, it's my day off. If you need something it can wait until my next shift. If you need me to come in because we are short staffed, well I'd prefer to hang out and watch Netflix, you should work on incentives for new hires and staff retention.'"
