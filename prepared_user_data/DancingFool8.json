        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'Teaching a 5/5 at university for 55k = bare minimum. Pay me appropriately for my expertise or lower my course load. There simply isn’t time to fully teach 135 kids English in 4 months.\nAnd, yes, this is the case everywhere. And it won’t change until the parents and students get pissed af at the people who don’t pay the professors enough.\nEdit: unfortunately, I don’t actually do the bare minimum because I like teaching interesting thing so I don’t blow my brains out. But fuck if I’m grading 135 essays in 2 weeks to the level those students deserve without getting paid for it. I get paid for 40 hours a week, and I time that shit.'"
