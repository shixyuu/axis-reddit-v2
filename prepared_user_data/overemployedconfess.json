        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting - How do I do it properly Been at J2 for 9 months. Reorg in March completely dismantled my team. Manager new what was happening and fled to a new team.\nWas assigned to a new team a couple of months ago. Have not had any work assigned in almost a month. I log on. Attend a couple of team meetings. And that is it. Asked my current (new) manager if there were opportunities to hop on other projects. They pretty much responded by telling me to enjoy the free time and that they would get back to me. A new manager for my team will be hired within the next month.\nI've applied for an internally posted role with no success. No response to application.\nAny thoughts on how to handle this situation. I literally am doing nothing and earning a paycheck. Am I wrong to continue logging in until I get let go?\nThought about taking PTO for a week. Thinking now that I should just save my PTO, log in, start my mouse jiggler, and go about my business.', a user said: 'Take some sick leave on the week that the new manager arrives to keep it going?'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'Still have quiet quit. I get my work done in an hour. Do what I want with the rest of the time.'"
