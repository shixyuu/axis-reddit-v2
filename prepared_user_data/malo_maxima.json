        "In response to 'Well… sort of. The logic is different if you are a traded company.\nAt a traded entity, if you push employee costs down the line but still make sure you keep shareholders whole and happy, you will get investment… so you get more money to spend incorrectly.\nEven though you will turn over employee resources and pay a premium to get them back, so will your competitors in many cases. If everyone is in a cycle of purging and retooling personnel, then the pain is not seen as self-inflicted. It all seems to be “environmental” at that point… you know, the old “Government is paying people to sit on their asses so nobody wants to work anymore” line of critical thinking 🙄\nSo why don’t boards and shareholders cry about turnover? Sometimes they do; but most of the time they don’t see the impact because their shares still payout. Turnover may even be where the gains they see that period originated.', a user said: 'This is really true about growing tech startups.\nIn my experience working in Silicon Valley, the worst are the “disrupter” and “growth phase” tech startups promising big shiny new IP to investors before it’s actually invented.\nThey don’t care about anything except keeping their investors happy, even if it means firing everyone who actually knows how to design the product they promised the investors because those engineers told them that what was promised wasn’t feasible.\nThen hire a bunch of new under-qualified yes men, keep them in the dark, and fire them when they figure out the company is just one big scheme to trick investors into pouring more money into the fraud pit. Keep the investors happy by buying trendy new furniture (cost gets subsidized by demanding loads of unpaid overtime from your workers by illegally misclassifying them as salaried) and throwing flashy dinner parties and “pivoting” your business plan in all kinds of directions all while the ship is simultaneously sinking and on fire. Doesn’t matter because the only ones that will drown and burn are the employees.\nGod, the amount of times they redecorated that stupid place instead of fixing the unsafe electrical outlets and faulty plumbing in my lab… ugh. I should’ve left when they fired my boss (a fellow scientist) and replaced him with a business manager to make decisions about the product… that he knew nothing about. To anyone reading this, please look out for red flags that my young naive ass didn’t see.'"
