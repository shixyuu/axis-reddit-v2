        "In response to 'Low effort on religion too which cracks me up. She thought those women not sleeping with other men and pretending to be \"in harmony\" with Kody was enough to keep God happy enough to give her her forever planet.\nSo that's why she still \"advocates\" for the family and \"hopes\" and says all the right things without actually doing a thing. Her ass is covered so who cares about everyone else's immortal souls.', a user said: 'She’s not covered, though.

Didn't he say he would love his daughters to give it a shot because he had so much happiness there?', a user said: 'He is part of one of the fundamentalist Mormon groups- so not a “mainstream” Mormon (they claim to not practice polygamy, but it is still their doctrine, and it’s known by most members they will be in polygamous marriages in the CK; also many men, including their “prophet” are sealed to multiple women, and it’s known they will all be wives in the CK). Mormons get REALLY touchy about being associated with the polygamist fundamentalists, but in truth they are practicing the faith the way Joseph Smith and Bring’em Young did.'"
