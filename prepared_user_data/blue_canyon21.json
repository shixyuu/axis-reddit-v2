        "In response to 'I think quiet quitting is some culture war bullshit fairy tale created to stir up controversy where there is none to generate clicks and ad revenue.\nThat said, there is an ebb and flow to work and the economy as a whole. I've always just had the mindset of doing everything that HAS to be done and push back on anything beyond the contractually agreed services, or charge for those additional services. It helps to have a good contract that clearly spells out what's included and what's available as additional services. I tend to procrastinate and do the bare minimum until it's go time and then I go beast mode for a while till it's done, then it's back to procrastinating.\nNo one is watching me so they don't know how I work. They see my results and they have been consistentlt happy with those results and have given me a lot of raises as I continue to perform well.\nBut let me tell you, I bet none of this would be true for me if I was in the office and they saw just how much I slack off between deadlines. I bet they would think I'm lazy or quiet quitting and load me up with more and more work.', a user said: 'Didn't the term come from that guy on Shark Tank after he was asked about the crap wages he was giving to his employees?'"
