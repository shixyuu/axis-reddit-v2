Despite his ignorance and bigotry, the guy really thought he had everything figured out. It's gotta be sad to have your whole worldview, everything you thought you knew, turned upside down. I hope life has gotten better for him, and I hope he has a different outlook on life now.', a user said: 'The crazy part is he DID have it all figured out, up until about 1995, and there lies ol' Rick's problem.'",

For whatever reason the pensions had all been basically canceled and the entire union workforce lost them.\nDude freaked out and tried to off himself. Thankfully it didn't happen but he and many other people across the country had this same shock of losing it all... and it's completely gotten worse now...', a user said: 'The shame of it all is people like this spend entire lifetimes voting against their own best interests, only to be surprised at the end by the consequences.\nAs they say:\n\"When the gods are angry, they give you that for which you ask\".\nThis is what you get when you put all of your effort into making someone else's life worse, instead of making everyone yours better, I suppose.'"
