        "In response to 'I kind of hate this term and the quit quitting wife the OP mentioned because it holds the husband to seemingly no accountability. It was the wife who chose to leave. It was the wife who decided to end the marriage. It doesn't describe the low/non-existent effort of their partner or do the wife any justice.\nUnless there is a complimentary term I'm just unaware of?', a user said: 'Yeah I’m used to this term “quiet quitting” being a bogus complaint by employers that an employee is\nonly\nperforming their job description and not kissing enough ass or doing free extra above and beyond labor.\nSo this is definitely off label usage but I get what OP means here. Quietly disengaging while preparing an exit strategy. It actually makes better sense in this context but it definitely caused me a double take also.'"
