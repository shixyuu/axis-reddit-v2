        "In response to 'Teachers have entered the chat.\nMy wife works two days a week as a teacher and has to work every evening, un paid, for a few hours just to keep on top of admin and prep.\nIt's mad', a user said: 'It greatly depends on the school. If you’re full-time you’re paid for 32.5 hours per week, or 1265 hours per year. This isn’t doable.\nMy last school was a Gulag from hell and I easily did at least double those hours every week just to keep my nose above water. Most of it was tick box for Ofsted bollox and a draconian marking policy initiated by a new deputy head trying to make their mark. Coupled with the air of general toxicity and the school’s ethos of bullying those who called it out, I ended up very, very ill whilst working there. Luckily, I escaped.\nMy current school is the antithesis of the previous one. I can get everything done in 40-45 hours, have my break and lunch if I want (I often choose to work through so I can leave before 4pm) and don’t need to take work home with me. The place is a revelation. Decent, supportive SLT who genuinely care about staff wellbeing is where it starts. They won’t pander to Ofsted either.\nSource: secondary science teacher now in their 25th year in the job.'"
