I was doing exactly that 16h a working through my splits and working all my days off for a shitty salary, when id ask about getting payed they would always say it will get added on, it never was. Also never recieved tips or any proportion of service charge which apparently \"goes towards our hard working staff\" the whole industry is built on lies. It took me getting to 8 stone and looking like i was on deaths door. I didnt even have the energy to quit i just said i had to go to the shop, had a mini breakdown turned my phone off and went to my mothers and slept on her couch for a day and a half.', a user said: 'Man, reading that hit me hard. I’ve had more than one breakdown at work in former jobs due a combination of long hours and mental illness. Going home to the sanctuary of your mum’s; there’s nothing like it. Hope you’re doing better now ❤️'",
        "In response to 'That's the kind of attitude that keeps people at 20k. I worked hard on the grind and hustle until I was earning 180k at age 20. And let me tell you, daddy wouldn't have gave me that job if he thought that his special guy was lazy like you lot.', a user said: 'Had me in the first half'"
