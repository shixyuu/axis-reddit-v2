I’ve been at Walmart 7 years this September. -.- they are right, above and beyond only gets you more work.That’s why we rarely see the Front End Team Leads and they delegate their work to new people who think they have a chance of moving up. Sorry buddy… nobody moves up in our store.', a user said: 'No offense, but why are you still there ? There are so many companies hiring with much higher salaries and no education required. Don’t be afraid to uproot yourself to improve your quality of life. You could easily triple your salary and work less.\nIf you are willing to move to Montreal, I could hook you up with a job like that before 08:00 today.'"
