        "In response to 'I have completed by graduation in 2020 ,got job in mid 2021 (due to covid) and resigned last year in an 2024 for competitive exams. Now since I failed the exam (just clear the cutoff) have no expectations I'm feeling lost what should I do. My dream was to get  80+ package but that dream is getting blur day by day.I have a career gap idk can I reach to that goal .I'm so stucked rn.', a user said: 'honestly itâ€™s good that your dream package is big but, practically speaking, 80+ LPA is tough even with 3 years of experience unless you're in some top-tier company. I've seen people in their 30s restart, go for higher studies and got around 40lpa package so i don't think career gap really matters if u have good skills.\nHope one day you definitely get your dream package. best luck'"
