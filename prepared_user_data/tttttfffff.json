        "In response to 'You are right I could. But out of all places where I was bullied in, this one is fairly easiest. I spent 15 years in health and social care followed by year and half in council. Or I already know how to deal with crappy people. Mean girl found herself reported to HR, all crap being recorded and called into meeting. She is happily ignoring me now. I am done running away from abuse. Also please note that I am practicing witch (believe what you like) so what goes around comes around and also I do not wish to harm the unhappy miserable brat, but I won't have her pushing me out out of job that is literally door into new direction of my career. I was abused as child, in schools and many employments and the patterns are so similar. I have been far too nice to point of being naive. Well no more. Sorry for long winded reply ðŸ˜Š', a user said: 'Sorry if this comes across as rude, but what the hell does â€˜practicing witchâ€™ mean?'",
        "In response to 'Witchcraft is a genuine thing but not in the sense that the media portrays (obviously). There's a religion called Wicca which a lot of witches follow. It's all to do with nature and spirituality basically (I think?)', a user said: 'Ah that sort of explains it a bit more thanks, I know youâ€™re not the OP I replied to but sorry again for sounding rude to him/her'"
