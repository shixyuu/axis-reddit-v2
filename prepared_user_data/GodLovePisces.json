        "In response to 'Original Post: ‘Service with a smile’ costs more than you think: research reveals becoming a happy, helpful employee takes effort and, eventually, it erodes the energy needed to do one’s job. It could lead to quiet quitting –the new term for just doing your job but not going above and beyond- or even quitting [External Link]: https://news.uga.edu/quiet-quitting-can-lead-to-burnout/', a user said: 'This study seems very limited and left me with more questions than answers. I don’t know what normal study sizes are for this type of research, but it doesn’t seem like a very big sample. Also I assume that it has not yet been replicated although they did try to cross check their results. It will be interesting to see what others find.\nAlso it doesn’t appear to take into account places where being happy is definitely part of the job. Also their conclusion seems to be that the effort to be positive is not worth it but the study does nothing to account for the good that actually comes from being positive, both to other employees and to customers.  I just found the conclusion baffling and not explained very well (maybe that’s my issue; I didn’t read through the study itself, just the recap). \nThis may turn out to be important information but I hesitate to take too much from it without a lot more information and discussion, especially considering how contrary it is to expectations.'"
