        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of work—life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'That’s the whole point of America.\nAmerica in reality is just a breeding ground for people to be groomed to be the perfect workers to be exploited by businesses.\nThis message of worshipping “hard work” and making more $ is rammed down our throat in every facet of life the day we are born. Americans are brainwashed into this cult like mindset that all that matters in life is work.\nCorporations spend billions of dollars pumping this message into the culture, and our education system has also slowly been getting taken over by corporate control as well.\nThis is why the mentality of excessive spending is pushed, this is why Americans are loaded to debt up to their eyeballs. It makes them easily exploitable workers.\nIn America businesses have more rights and freedoms than human beings.'",
