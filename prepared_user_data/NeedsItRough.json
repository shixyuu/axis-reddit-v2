If I have to work overtime I’m claiming every single millisecond of it. It’s a job. Not my life\nHad a situation once where someone called in sick and no one could come in to replace them. Which is not the end of the world. Had to stay 30 minutes passed my scheduled time to ensure everything was done, so I put that on my timesheet. When I came in the next day I saw someone scratched out my 30 minutes extra and put in my normal finish time. Obviously that pissed me off so I went to the boss and asked what the fuck was this. They said they don’t pay overtime and other shit.\nSo I said well here’s what’s gonna happen. Either you pay me for the extra time or I’ll go straight to the department of labour and file a complaint. Don’t think they expected a 20 year old (at the time) to stick up for themselves.', a user said: 'Someone changing my clock out time like that would set me off, just reading about it made me feel rage.\nDid they change it back?  Did you stay at that job?'"
