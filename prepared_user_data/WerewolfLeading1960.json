        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shop😂', a user said: 'What if that person doesn’t have notifications turned on for the DoorDash app? Hell I’m a driver and I don’t even have notifications turned on for the customer app because they send so many.\nHonestly in this situation the customer is right. You should have tried to call, and for shopping orders it specifically says if you don’t get a message back about substitutions prior to checking out to call the customer 🤦🏼‍♀️'",
        "In response to 'Why would you want notifications off for a service like this?', a user said: 'My whole point is that shit happens and we have no idea why some people don’t respond to messages, and as drivers it’s not that difficult to call a customer when there’s an issue.'",
        "In response to 'Despite the annoying amount of notifications It'd be pretty dumb to turn it off when you're legitimately expecting something you just ordered. I feel most confused when what I have is a gift', a user said: 'I absolutely DESPISE gift orders. I’ve only had a customer (I guess the gift giver?) respond to me once and it never fails that an order like that will have some kind of issue 🤦🏼‍♀️'"
