        "In response to '$120k is the new $70k. Itâ€™s really not that outlandish anymore. 25% of adult males in the United States make this or more.', a user said: 'I think you mean that just with inflation, the \"doing well\" 55k - 90k salary is no longer \"doing well\" and now feels like the lower side, right? I don't think 120k is quite there yet (maybe in a decade or so). $120,000 in 2022 is $93,000 in 2010. 35%+ inflation since 2010. So it might be more accurate to say 120k is the new 90k.\nI do think the \"doing well\" salary is shifting towards the higher end.\nSource:\nhttps://www.usinflationcalculator.com/'"
