        "In response to 'Actually it’s very shocking that Kody always said Christine needed to put more effort into their marriage. Christine had 6 children, watched ALL the OG children so Meri and Janelle could work, and still had part time jobs. Robyn had her kids doing the MSWC shipping, never worked, always had Nannie’s… what to hell does she do besides keeping Kody sexually satisfied? \nRobyn was able to treat Kody like her best customer because all the hard work of being a mom was being done by others. I’m sure Christine could have been better in the sack too if she hadn’t just watched 13 kids, cooked and cleaned.', a user said: 'Remember the event they had a booth and she complained no one was supportive of the business?  I vaguely recall complaints of not getting any support, wanting the other wives to devote more time and support/build the business.  Funny thing was she had No Concrete Ideas as to exactly How they were to do anything, What she thought they should do to build the business.  Basically complained they weren’t doing enough but didn’t know what they needed to do for it to be successful.  Like get a decent designer (fire doodling Robin), make a product that appeals to people outside your family and get into a different business.'"
