        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is corporate propaganda/gaslighting', a user said: 'This is the first time I’ve heard of quiet quitting and it’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.\nI worked long hours during my entry level jobs because I wanted to get ahead fast and gtfo out of those shitty jobs.\nNow that I’m in a good position, I work 9-5. That’s it. If someone messages me at 5:01pm, I message them at 9:00am the next day about it.\nFuck companies and people that think I\nhave\nto work over my paid amount. You pay me for my time, that’s the contract. If I’m going above and beyond, it’s because I’m looking out for myself and it’s probably because I’m interested in learning something that’ll let me demand a higher salary.'"
