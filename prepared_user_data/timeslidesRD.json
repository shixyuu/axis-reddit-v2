        "In response to 'A few months ago there was a lady in a company all-hands meeting (400-odd people in the teams call) ask why we work based on hours and not the output of our work/tasks i.e. if we are given a task for a week and we work hard to complete it in 3 days, why can't we take the other 2days off? HR didn't really have a response to the question and it was almost like the couldn't compute why someone would ask that.\nI promptly replied in the chat (I know, stupid of me) that we live in a capitalist society where hard work is rewarded by more work and that's why there is no incentive to work hard or beyond what is expected.\nAt the end of the meeting the head of HR sent a message, publicly so everyone could see, along the lines of \"@Haan_Solo, I will put something in the diary to discuss your comment.\"\nShe really didn't like me saying that. I did become somewhat infamous in the office after that though haha', a user said: 'Hahaha fuck brave man'"
