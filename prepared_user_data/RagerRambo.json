And of course it's on TikTok.\nQuiet quitting: The workplace trend taking over TikTok - BBC News\nKids today need to learn more about unions and industrial action.!', a user said: 'Genuine question. Do you all think this term applies to all fields or just low-skilled work? If you're a checkout girl I fully get doing your contacted hours and duties going home. How does a software developer or teacher \"work their wage\"? Employer doesn't give you a list of duties that form your contract.'",
        "In response to 'Software Developers and teachers are often contracted to do around 40 hours a week, but have to do more to meet their objectives. Also, there are activities that aren’t part of your job that are done out of “good will” (e.g. travel, being on call, paying for small items out of your own money, adjusting shifts etc)', a user said: 'Yah that is what I thought so it would be interesting if people in those professions feel and work in a similar fashion.  Although, many professional jobs will have performance based bonus.\nI'd struggle working alongside someone that thinks like this. Just seems lazy and uninterested in the job/company success. Clearly I'm not a fan of\nr/antiwork\nbut I do want to try and understand where are others are coming from'"
