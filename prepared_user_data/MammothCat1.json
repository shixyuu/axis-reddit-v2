        "In response to 'Paying X and getting X10 does not apply anywhere else in the market\nThis is what I don't understand about employers who expect their employees to \"go above and beyond\" like, if someone hired a contractor to lay some turf no one would expect them to also replace a broken fence, so why do they expect it from a regular employee?', a user said: 'a few years ago there was a trend in hiring that was basically paying for a sloth but wanting a squirrel. I'm sure there was some sort of official term for it but there it is. It was starting to look grim but no pandemic or crisis was around other than maybe the 08 housing pop that caused issues to this idea.\nBUT it only seems to work with corporate in mind. You head into say a landscaping or trades work, the multiskilled individual tends to be fully able to say \"well thats extra and its this much\". Which is to be expected.\nThats actually why you'll see many landscapers have a fence branch, its just upselling to a different department to make the process easier on the client. usually its never the same guys putting down turf but the client doesn't care, they just want a fence.'"
