        "In response to 'So I just looked up the definition of \"quiet quitting.\" Sounds like a boomer phrase. We don't live in the \"above and beyond\" world anymore and the reason for that is simple: The only reward for going above and beyond is more work. Younger generations (and I'm throwing us millennials in there as well) are smart about that these days and are tired of getting taken advantage of. We do the work we're paid to do. If you want more, you pay more (or provide other rewards).\nInflation adjusted, $120k now would be the equivalent of $103k in 2019 when the world was normal. 2015 it would've been $96k. What was the pay for the position in question pre-pandemic?\nAs for remote, yea, welcome to 2022. There's very little reason for a sysadmin to be in the office most days and there's no shortage of national job postings that\nare\nfully remote and offering competitive wages. You're not going to hold an admin for long if you're not somewhat flexible on remote work.\nThe knowledge part? Yea, that's on them.', a user said: '$120k now would be the equivalent of $103k in 2019 when the world was normal.\nHoly fuck. Itâ€™s true, and I need a raise.\nCOVID really covered up cost of living spikes.'"
