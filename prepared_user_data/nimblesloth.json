        "In response to 'Time for math!\nWalmart gross profit for 2021 was $138,836,000,000.\nWalmart had 2,300,000 employees at the end of 2021.\nThat's enough to give every employee $59,493 - a life-changing amount of money for pretty much everyone.\nThey pay their average employee barely $30,000 a year.', a user said: 'Gross profit is sales - cost of goods. They then have to pay wages, utilities, maintenance, transportation, taxes, etc. Their net income after paying expenses was around 13.5 billion. Divided by your 2,300,000 employee count would give about $5,800 to every employee.'"
