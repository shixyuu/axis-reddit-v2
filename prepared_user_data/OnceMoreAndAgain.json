        "In response to 'In retail, \"Quiet Firing\" happens all the time. You don't like the employee for whatever reason, you just schedule them little to no hours until they leave. I've seen it happen so many times.', a user said: 'As someone who was forced by their parents to get a part time job as a cashier during high school while taking four AP classes, being addicted to World of Warcraft, and playing on the tennis team, I saw being quiet fired as an absolute win. I went from being scheduled 20 hours per week to being scheduled 10 hours per week within two months of being hired because I refused to do the sales pitch for Best Buy credit cards lol (huge fucking scam btw).'"
