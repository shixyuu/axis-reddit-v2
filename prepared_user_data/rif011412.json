        "In response to '\"If you hate your job, you don't [quit]! You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way!\"', a user said: 'People quit managers not jobs.  This is why any leverage given to the working class hurts profits.  Why quit if the manager isnt the main problem?  The job can be awful, which most are, but since the manager isnt the main reason for quitting, people do shitty work for a shitty company.\nMost mangers nowadays are bad at their jobs, but they arent always the problem.  Lack of training, ill suited temperament, picked from a group of poor candidates etc.  The real problem is business culture.  Its not investing in its managers, so the business goes to shit, and they blame the workers.\nAnecdotally the biggest failures of my current business world, is ignoring worker retention, thus not allowing for senior/master employees to train their replacement properly.  That sort of training is reinvestment  in the company, and a cost most businesses want to avoid.  They expect to be able to plug and play other employees in a revolving door.  No one becomes a master, everyone becomes a place holder.'"
