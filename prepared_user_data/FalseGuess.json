        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of work—life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'It's not a thing. Some lunatics on the internet just tried to rebrand \"doing your job\" as quitting because employers are so used to exploiting people.\nDoing the bare minimum is what people are paid to do. If you want people to do extra, compensate them for it, whether it's increased vacation days, more money, extra sick days, company stock, better retirement, or something of monetary value.\nThings like a positive and supportive working environment don't count because that should be the default. Companies are used to providing less than the bare minimum for their employees, but expecting to get more than the bare minimum from them.'"
