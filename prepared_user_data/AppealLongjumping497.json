        "In response to 'It's not a thing, but employers trying to shame people for not devoting their entire existence to them sure want to make it a thing', a user said: 'Agreed.  At my previous job I started to shut my work phone off at the end of my shift down to the minute.  I was hourly, and unless overtime was required I was under no obligation to answer that phone on MY time.\nA supervisor called me into his office one day and he asked why I did not answer my phone.  He had called 10 minutes after my shift ended for some problem that he needed my input on. He even went to explain the problem (which dealt with a customer concern) was serious as if that alone supported his explanation why I needed to be contacted. I could have answered the call and clocked the phone time as overtime was part of his explanation.\nThink about that for a minute.\nI simply told my supervisor that I had completed my work for the day, and that I was not informed overtime was needed.  Using the same tactic managers like to employ I questioned him by asking if leaving the phone on to be available to take unexpected calls meant I was on call.\nMy supervisor changed the conversation, and never brought up the matter again.  I still shut my phone off at the end of the work day.'",
        "In response to 'It is a real issue.\nToday I bought one loaf of bread. I expected the store to go above and beyond and give me another one for free but they didn't do it. They just quietly quit on me and gave me bare minimum for the price I paid!\nNobody wants to bake anymore.', a user said: 'Make America Bake Again!  ðŸ˜†'"
