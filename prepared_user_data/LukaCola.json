        "In response to 'Original Post: Psychedelic mushrooms and quiet quitting: Psilocybin use tied to working fewer overtime hours [External Link]: https://www.psypost.org/2023/09/psychedelic-mushrooms-and-quiet-quitting-psilocybin-use-tied-to-working-fewer-overtime-hours-213829', a user said: 'The author's results are pretty minor and the journalist reporting on them is definitely taking liberties with terms and concepts here:\nPsychedelic users are more likely to be male and well-educated compared to the general population, which are both factors related to working in industries that commonly require or encourage overtime work. After these factors were accounted for, psilocybin use was negatively associated with overtime hours worked.\nOn average, psilocybin users clocked about 3.60 minutes less of overtime per week.\nI think it's an interesting conclusion but it sounds like a low-power factor. I can't find this article through my institution, but I'm curious what the R2 values were as it sounds like he ran some kind of weighted regression analysis. An impact of less than a minute per day, even if significant, probably doesn't imply a lot about the relationship.\nDr. Korman sounds entirely reasonable about the conclusions though - I definitely don't want to give them a hard time for what they did. They had an idea and it sounds like they added to the literature, that's where a lot of great research starts.'"
