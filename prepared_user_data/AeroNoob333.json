        "In response to 'Original Post: I think my remote team mate is quiet quitting And it's ticking me off. Need advice if I should say something?\nMy team is fully remote,  spread  across the US. Our individual and team metrics are tracked by the amount of tickets we process on a weekly basis. This is a FULL time job and I've found that a member of our team is only logging about 4 hours a day - if that! Meanwhile, the rest of the team is putting in 9 hr days just to keep up with the volume.  We've also had to log in and work the last two Saturdays just to clear the backlog.  If this person would just work a normal day,  it would lighten the load on each of us. Our manager hasn't seemed to notice that this  person's \"numbers\" are half of what the other team members are producing. Do I speak up or keep my trap shut,  silently seething all day?\n**Thank you everyone for your input! I'm not going to do my managers job for them,  if they don't care,  I won't care either.  I'll hit my targets and focus on my career advancement in 2025.', a user said: 'Does that team member do the same amount of tickets in 4 hours as someone who does it in 8? The reason I ask is because I too only work like MAYBE 6 hours a day. On a good day. But I get paid by the hour so I just don’t charge the hours I don’t work. But I also get my more work done, faster, and with less reworks than most members of our team. So yeah, I could work a full 8 hours and get 1.5x to 2x the amount of tickets than most people but I stop at what I’ve been assigned.'",
        "In response to 'Definitely not,  only completing about half of what everyone else is doing', a user said: 'Well, that’s a problem, but not your problem. It’s definitely a manager problem. I’d just hunker down and do your thing unless your KPI and metrics are based on the overall team performance and not just your own.\nProbably just a different process but I really like ours. We work in Sprints and put (admittedly arbitrary) story points on them as a team, then they assign the stories to us evenly. Then, it’s up to us how we get it done. I typically get mine done at least a week ahead of schedule regardless of not working full time. Like I worked a total of 48 hours in November because holidays were stressing me out 😅 but still got all my work done (tho not in a week ahead do everyone else like I typically do). Maybe we just suck at story pointing? 🤷‍♀️ But not everyone finishes theirs on time.'",
        "Quiet Quitting: What is it Really? Quiet quitting is a confusing term to me, but maybe I just don’t understand it. I have rarely ever given 120% to a job… maybe when I was fresh out of college when I had that mindset. But the years have jaded me. What people call “quiet quitting” (doing the minimum) is what I just call doing my job lol. It’s not like I refuse when they ask me to do more work (tho rarely do they ask), but I don’t SEEK more work out unless I’m just bored. For example, in my work, we work in Sprints and get assigned stories to do for those sprints. I just do those stories — not more or less — unless I’m just bored and have finished my stories weeks in advance, then I may grab a story for the next Sprint. I get paid by the hour so no work means no pay. But it’s not like I can ADD more stories to the current Sprint because someone else still needs to test them and THEY may not have capacity. So, a lot of times I just do things around the house since there always seems to be something to do at home. Have I been quiet quitting for years and just didn’t know it or is doing the minimum not really what quiet quitting is all about?",
        "In response to 'Pretending you care about things at work', a user said: 'Isn’t that everyone? Like, I don’t particularly care about my work, but I love the money I make from it. It has allowed me to live a more luxurious life while WFH. It’s a means to an end tho: nothing more, nothing less.'",
        "In response to 'FML, I’ve been quiet quitting for years and my boss is now trying to promote me wtf!', a user said: 'Haha the bar must be low where you work 😂'",
        "In response to 'Why?\nDepends on industry #1.\nWork Ethic environment. #2,\nMy generation (X) was told / taught / saw / experienced: \"No matter what you are going to do, give it 100%\".  That was everything from relationships, sports, work, and even entertainment...\nMovies\n\"Top Gun\" (1986) - Maverick didn’t just fly jets; he lived at Mach speed. The \"need for speed\" line and Tom Cruise’s cocky grin screamed total commitment to the bit. The whole movie’s a love letter to going all out.\n\"Jerry Maguire\" (1996) - \"Show me the money!\" wasn’t just a catchphrase—it was Tom Cruise betting everything on passion and hustle. The whole movie’s about going full throttle for what you believe in.\nCatchphrases & Slang\n\"Go big or go home\" - This phrase started picking up steam in the '90s, perfectly summing up the decade’s obsession with maximum effort.\n\"All that and a bag of chips\" - Meaning you’re the best and then some, it’s peak '90s over-the-top confidence.\n\"Take it to the max\" - Pure '80s—everything had to be bigger, louder, more extreme.\nWe are hard wired with meet and exceed expectations as a thing.', a user said: 'How do you not burn out? I was that overachiever kid throughout my entire life in school. But I saw the rewards for doing so. We were ranked. I was always at the top. It was easy to continue doing so. At work? Nope. Apparently, that’s not how it works in the corporate world. You have to kiss a** to get to the top and that just seemed exhausting.'",
        "In response to 'Quiet Quitting is do your time and go home no more no less and do as little as possible while you're there but smart people learn as much as they can and take that new training and knowledge to the next employer to make more money and continue to do so about every 3 yrs 2 things can happen A your so good a something you build your own business out of it or B. A Company or Employer will pay you to Run the company. But be forwarnd Debt will put you in employment prison.', a user said: 'I guess a lot of this doesn’t really apply to me. I’ve only ever been a W-2 employee once in my life for one company then promptly went independent starting my own “company” (with only me as an employee) when I was 26 years old. I get paid hourly now as a software consultant so altho I don’t work 40 hours a week even, I don’t get paid for the hours I don’t work. As long as I’m finishing what I’m assigned (so bare minimum), they actually would prefer that I did it in less time than most people. I am there if they need me to work more, but they know they’ll be paying me more too for that time.'",
        "In response to 'My understanding is “quiet quitting” isn’t quitting at all unless you’re not meeting expectations. It’s just a hostile term for not grinding yourself to scraps for some company until there’s nothing left for you. I say screw that.\nMy last job I gave 100% consistently, IMO above and beyond expectations. And don’t get me wrong, I was rewarded for it, both in accolades and financially, but I also completely burned out and became entirely demotivated after a few years.\nMy current job my average output is more like 50% to maybe 65% consistently. I don’t overly stress, it’s generally cushy, and I can and do scale up my effort when it’s explicitly needed. I still receive accolades and commensurate pay (and bonuses), and I’m recovering from burnout now and am in a better place.\nSome might call not putting in maximal effort “quiet quitting” but I just don’t see it that way. I’m productive enough to perform well, my work is recognized, and I’m maintaining my sanity and well being. That’s just better all around.', a user said: 'I love this! What others call “quiet quitting” is really just setting boundaries and prioritizing a work-life balance.'",
        "In response to 'doing the minimum is not \"quiet quitting\", it's just being a slacker.\nunfortunately, op's attitude is becoming more the norm: \"i'll do whatever i'm asked, but i'm not gonna take any initiative to do anything that i know perfectly well needs to be done.\"\nthe net result of this is that the people who actually DO give a shit about the company's success (and therefore, ultimately, their own) end up picking up all the slack. this only serves to enable the slackers more. round and round it goes.', a user said: 'So, I used to be that “go-getter” person. I would recognize a problem and I would speak up. I’m a software developer who happens to also know a lot of the business side because I typically do both (and it honestly helps to know WHY you’re developing something). I would see such poorly implemented systems and our functional “business analysts” don’t ever push back when something doesn’t make sense or they would suggest to do something that make no sense (and even at times could bite them in the butt in the future).\nBut, after being told multiple times to pretty much “stay in your lane” because I’m just a developer, you get jaded and you stop giving two sh*ts. I still say something when there’s something I don’t agree with or I know can cause problems in the future, but I’m not as vehement about it anymore. If they insist I just do as I’m told, guess what I’m going to do? Do as I’m told. I take the “Well, they’ll come crying later and I’ll fix it then.” approach nowadays. It’s just not worth the stress of trying to get your point across and being labeled a “know-it-all” and “argumentative”. I can’t tell you how many I’ve reworked something because they wouldn’t listen to me in the first place. And I so want to say, “I told you so.” all those times. I just count the dollar signs now every time they tell me to redo something to the way I had suggested in the first place when they wouldn’t listen.'",
        "In response to 'In my 40+ years of working, I have learned the hard way that going above and beyond, or putting in more than 40 hours is seldom appreciated. You’re expendable to save a few bucks no matter what you do.', a user said: 'This is why I’m honestly glad I’m a contractor and not an employee. I don’t have to worry about “promotions” or “raises”. I just ask for a little bit more every contract renewal. If they say “No”, then no harm, no foul. I get to put away more than double in a 401K as someone self employed vs an employee. I have no loyalties to anyone but to myself because most companies don’t deserve it.'",
        "In response to 'Same here...I got jaded really fast at corporate culture out of college.', a user said: 'lol that’s what happened to me. I used to go above and beyond. Lasted maybe a year then I started “quiet quitting” if that’s what it’s really called 🤷‍♀️'",
        "In response to 'Ah, Agile team management.  New fun words for the same old bureaucratic slog.', a user said: 'lol everyone does it for software development. I was at a client where it was so bad… we spent more time sizing the sprints than actually doing the work. We’d have 4 hour long meetings doing that. It was the most ridiculous thing'",
        "In response to 'I think I quietly quit my job (I’m actually in the last week of work at my current company) but I took it to mean slowly pushing responsibilities off to coworkers/refusing new projects.\nI knew I was leaving for over a month but only wanted to give my two weeks because I had a week off scheduled and if I put in that I was leaving my vacation days would have been cancelled by my boss. As soon as I was signed with the other company I stopped doing revisions to a project and let my teammates handle them. Then I stopped handling samples. Then I stopped taking new projects by saying I was going on vacation and with our typical 2 week turn around I wouldn’t be here for the second half of the project so I’d handle finishing out other projects/revisions…that I had already passed to other people. Finally put in my two weeks and have had next to nothing to work on because I’m supposed to be “finishing out any ongoing projects” but I already finished most things so I’m really just answering a few emails and making sure other people have all the stuff they need for when I’m officially done.', a user said: 'Now this makes sense. I hate the “new definition” because it makes it feel like doing the minimum for your job is somehow a bad thing'",
        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is a translation of the lying flat movement in Asia. It’s giving boundaries to work and not allowing work to take more of your life than you are willing. To abusers who don’t understand boundaries it looks like not doing enough. To people who work for a living it means having their mental and physical time back to live their life.', a user said: 'I wish they had a better name for it because “quitting” has such a negative connotation. It makes you feel not going above & beyond all the time is somehow a negative thing'",
        "In response to 'If you are someone like me who always gave as much as you could, but then realized it gets you nowhere so you just do what you need to and nothing more, it DOES feel like quitting somehow.\nBut if you've always been mediocre you're not gonna feel that, of course.', a user said: 'I guess it felt like that in the beginning. I always worked above and beyond right out of college, but then realized it didn’t matter so I just do the minimum I’ve been asked to. It just feels normal now.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Yeah I actually love being paid hourly. I can choose to work however many hours I want. Usually, that’s less than 40 hours a week.'",
        "In response to 'Most ppl aren't trying to be let go. They are trying not to work themselves to death only to be overlooked or mistreated', a user said: 'Then why is it called “quiet quitting” as if you expect that doing the minimum will get you let go eventually.'",
        "In response to 'My opinion - if you are hourly and need to have billable hours... you aren't quiet quitting.\nWhat quiet quitting meant to me was essentially - doing just enough to not get fired or trying to just slip through the cracks so people didn't really notice how much you were or werent working.  For example - my wife manages an executive assistant who is supposed to support a team of people.  She essentially started doing things slow enough where they would just do it themselves.  Now she essentially has the people she's supposed to support, supporting themselves.\nThis has been an issue for around 6 months, but HR moves so slowly so she's still employed and will just be getting on a PIP now, and have another few months before she's let go.  Thats what quiet quitting has always been to me.  Stop doing most or all of your job and hope no one notices.\nPeople who do the minimum of what they're asked and get it done in the requested time are just normal...', a user said: 'Now, this makes more sense to me! We had a guy at work we called the “Do Nothing” guy. He literally did nothing lol but he was there for at least 6 months before any manager noticed and got let go.'",
        "In response to 'It can mean wildly different things depending on who you ask\nTo some it’s “do the absolute bare minimum to put off being fired as long as possible”, and to others it’s just “don’t go above and beyond”', a user said: 'But I guess I’m confused why doing the bare minimum is considered quiet quitting. Isn’t that what the job description says? If you’re hitting your minimum performance metrics, and for us it’s easy because it’s just “Did you do your stories or not?”, I don’t know why that would ever get your fired eventually.'"
