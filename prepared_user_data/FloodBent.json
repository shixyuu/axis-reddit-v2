        "In response to 'It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime, so where's the motivation? And here's something else, Bob: I have eight different bosses right now', a user said: 'That was my experience. Worked for a company for many years and my raise didn’t even cover the cost of living increase each year. It didn’t matter how much effort I put in. The last 3 years on the job I did quiet quit until the Covid hit and lost the job. But during the first year of the pandemic i cut my expenses drastically since there was no eating out, or outside entertainment. I learned what is the minimum I can live on and that I actually don’t need more. The time away from early morning conference calls and from stress was just sooo good. I think I have enough to last me until social security if the inflation doesn’t go completely crazy.'"
