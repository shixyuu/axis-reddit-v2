        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting got me a bonus and a 15% raise I work from home and stopped trying about a year ago. I do monthly closing entries (10 hours of work), but other than that, I hardly do anything. I take my time responding to emails, decline meetings I don't have to join, etc. Since we were acquired and there's been turnover in management, my boss doesn't know what my job involves, and is also weirdly-averse to delegation (workaholic type), so I don't get assigned to anything.  Since I'm just chilling all day with my dog, I'm holding out here until they replace me or until kids come along, maybe in another year.\nWell my boss called me up today to tell me I'm doing a \"great job\". We exceeded targets, so I'm getting 2x my bonus (20k, target was 10k), and a 15% raise (100k to 115k).  Que sera, sera..', a user said: 'Bro are you me? Literally the same situation with roughly the same pay. Do you not get paranoid constantly that the end is near?'",
        "In response to 'lol, why would he be worried he just got a fat ass raise.\nLook, I’m not going to give someone a big ass raise if I think they didn’t deserve it. Therefore, he is legit doing what they are asking of him, nothing more. Ain’t no shame in that game.', a user said: 'I think it’s the disconnect between him and management. If you’re a director managing 20+ people, it’s kind of difficult to know what exactly everyone does. If management found out how much he’s actually contributing, he probably wouldn’t be there. I guess it’s the fear of having someone find out?'"
