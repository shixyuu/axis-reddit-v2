        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. 💪', a user said: 'I used to try to go above and beyond… what did that get me? I haven’t had a performance review in… like 4 department heads. When I got my raise I asked the SM if it included equipment, being coverage for other departments, using multiple cutting machines, training. “We’re a working warehouse so that’s expected of everyone.” “Why are so few driving then?” “We had to tell some people no, due to safety issues.”\nI’m scheduled in Garden this coming Saturday to midnight. No idea what I’m doing, how the vendors set up the plants, no product knowledge aside from being able to read packaging. “But you can drive!!” Not my fault there’s no incentive. May be a matter of time until my license ends up on the SMs door.\nIf everyone turned in their licenses saying they didn’t want them back unless they came with a raise, we’d get one.'"
