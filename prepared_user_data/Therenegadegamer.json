        "In response to 'Worked at a gas station for four years. I worked afternoons and if the midnight shifter no call no showed, I‚Äôd have to stay over and work 16hrs. I‚Äôd do this many times a week because we couldn‚Äôt keep midnight shifters. And at this company if you no call no show then the company takes that as your resignation. I‚Äôd call my manager, who was supposed to come in at least early, wouldn‚Äôt come in and people on first would be ‚Äúdrunk already‚Äù so they couldn‚Äôt come in. I‚Äôd see my manager twice. What did I get? NOTHING. A sympathetic look and a thanks. I was a team leader too. FUCK YOU SUNRISE AND TOM FOSTER.', a user said: 'Sounds like a similar experience with Circle K with a manager tried to guilt trip me into going in on my day off because there were call offs and if I didn't then she'd have the person who already worked a double work a triple shift 24 hours straight I quit that hellhole and they've been struggling since'",

        "In response to 'The worse than covid part doesn't make sense', a user said: 'It's a real quote the people at the top are thar delusional and self centered'",
        "In response to 'https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy50nUYyTKM&pp=ygUddGhlIHNpbXBzb25zIGN1dCBldmVyeSBjb3JuZXI%3D', a user said: 'Lol that's gold'",
