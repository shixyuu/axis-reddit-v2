        "In response to 'I was in the Army when a  Colonel told me to act my pay grade. Stop doing extra and do what my rank was assigned without the bows and ribbons. Take my lunch, quit working though it. I was worried about things that could wait until the next day.\nWork your wage, yo.', a user said: 'Yeah. I worked five minutes past when I’m supposed to log off to finish up a project yesterday. I’m salary so I don’t see how it would matter to anyone else, but my boss scolded me when she got an email notification that I had finished the project. She also keeps reminding me to hurry up and use all my PTO before the year ends. Love this woman.'"
