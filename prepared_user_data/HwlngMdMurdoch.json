Make sure the kids are taken care of separately (i.e. that she can't touch anything left to them without approval). Set up trust funds for when they are of age. Set them up for their future. I'm not saying leave her out of it completely, or make it where she can't manage caring for them. The kids deserve more than what she's giving you.'"
