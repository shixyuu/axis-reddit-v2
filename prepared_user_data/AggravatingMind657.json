        "In response to 'Original Post: UCLA SPORTS Analysis: After years of quiet quitting, Chip Kelly admits he didnâ€™t want to be at UCLA https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2024-03-05/analysis-chip-kelly-didnt-want-to-coach-ucla', a user said: 'I lived in LA for a while. Growing up, I remember UCLA looking amazing on TV. The O'Bannon brothers playing at sold out Pauley Pavilion. Cade McNown playing in shootouts to sold out crowds in the Rose Bowl.\nNow UCLA, feels like such a shell of what it once was. Admissions is tougher, academics are great, but its full of students that don't care about the athletic department and lack the school spirit of Oregon.'"
