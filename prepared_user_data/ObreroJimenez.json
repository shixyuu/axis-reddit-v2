        "In response to 'It's amazing how many employers are getting mad about employees refusing to be exploited.', a user said: 'I had two bosses at a previous job who were genuinely boggled that I wouldn't do what they thought were \"common things that employees should do.\"\nOne boss gave me a $20 and told me to pick up doughnuts the next morning before work.  I was going to charge him overtime until he apologized; he realized that it was out of place as a work request.  It was a \"no harm, no foul\" situation for me at that point, but I've had others.\nOne boss wanted me to go pick up three laptops at an electronics store near the job and put them on my own credit card.  \"No.\"  *boggle* \"Why not?  The company will reimburse you.\"  \"Would the company lend me (price of\nNICE\nlaptop * 3) for several weeks?  No?\"\nIt was an I.T. job where some server monitoring and troubleshooting was involved.  I was \"selected at random\" to wake up twice in the middle of the night and check server health, plus troubleshoot as needed.  \"No.\" *boggle* \"Why not?  We'll pay you for the time you've worked.\"  \"You require two weeks' notice if I need a day off.  Changes to my schedule require two weeks notice.\"'"
