        "In response to 'Previous MSP GM refused to pay senior techs senior tech wages. Wanted to pay 50k in a city where 3bed/2bath homes that aren't actual shacks start at 500k.\nHe lost his entire staff of senior techs other than two, one close to retirement and one young guy who doesn't even understand subnets. This was in the course of last year and hired all service desk to replace us.\nI've heard from some of my former clients and they're all considering a change upon contract expiry. I'm happily internal to my company, so I've just been recommending an MSP one other former co-worker went to', a user said: 'Subnets are confusing. Domnets are much more exciting.'"
