        "In response to 'Original Post: What happened with quiet quitting? I'm definitively going to start quiet quitting this next month. I'm not proud to work at my current company (quite the opposite) and my boss thinks he's paying to make me his slave.\nBut I was looking for tips on how to start quiet quitting here on Reddit and I could only find old posts. It seems like it's not a thing anymore. Is quiet quitting dead? What have I missed?', a user said: '“Quiet quitting” is a term developed by corporations to describe people doing their job, and only their job. Going “above and beyond” doesn’t result in a promotion or more pay. It usually only results with more responsibilities, so why do it? This doesn’t mean you don’t do your job effectively.\nI became a supervisor for one location at my former job. When I was first hired, the person I worked with wasn’t a “supervisor” in title or pay, but he performed all the duties of a supervisor. He was promised that he’d be promoted, and told that he should get used to the duties until then. He finally got that “promotion” six years later.\nBefore I was promoted as a supervisor at my location, they tried to convince two other supervisors to simply cover an additional location, without any additional pay. They refused.\nEach supervisor was only supposed to responsible for their location, but one supervisor was constantly assigned larger tasks. When she finally left, we all refused to take up all the additional tasks she did. The upper managers were upset they had to do this work.\nDo the job you’re hired to do. Don’t take work home with you. When you’re off the clock, you’re off the clock. Only respond to calls/texts if you want to. Use your vacation time.\nCorporations call this “quiet quitting.” I call it “living.”'"
