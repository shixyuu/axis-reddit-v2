        "In response to 'I've been quiet quitting since my first job. I've just learned to create the illusion that I'm busy these days.', a user said: 'Yeah I was honestly shocked when I found out what \"quiet quitting\" meant. Before I heard the definition I assumed it was when you stopped doing ANYTHING, and just waited to see how long until you got fired, thereby collecting a pay check until someone noticed you weren't doing shit.\nI don't understand how just doing the baseline expected of you is \"quitting\" in any way, shape, or form. The term makes no sense.'"
