        "In response to 'In the US, salaried workers are not eligible for overtime. You get paid the same no matter how many hours you work.', a user said: 'Technically incorrect. Salaried workers are entitled to overtime if they are consistently working over 40 hours. It doesn’t happen because most people don’t fight for it and/or the job threatens them.
