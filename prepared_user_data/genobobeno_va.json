        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'Research existing grants for your own non-profit or consulting company. You don’t have to submit them for the university… but you can draft them and submit a few for the F of it. But it’s an exercise in surveying the space for money that can be used for starting a small business if you’re open to that.'",
        "In response to 'Omg I LOVE this idea! There are grants that fund consulting companies??', a user said: 'Hell yes.\n“Consulting” is whatever you want it to be.'"
