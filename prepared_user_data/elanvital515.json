[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'That term is such bullshit. \"Quiet quitting\" is literally just doing your job and not forcing yourself to go above and beyond to do things that weren't in the job description. It's obvious that greedy big corporations are trying to guilt-trip workers. If you hear that term being used, that place is a toxic workplace that doesn't care about you.'"
