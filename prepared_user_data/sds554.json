        "In response to 'If that happened in my class, it would be time for an impromptu labor lesson where we learn that \"quiet quitting\" is just a propagandized version of \"work to rule,\" and that I support them in asserting the value of their labor! But then I'd ask them to tell me what value that labor brings into the classroom. Because generally, the thrust behind work to rule is that the labor of the worker is not being valued or is being exploited for someone else's gain, therefore the worker will not be contributing any labor beyond the barest terms of their employment contract.\nSo, I would say to them, please fill in the blanks on that metaphor for me. If you can do so successfully, you've earned my respect and admiration. If not, you're probably only hurting yourself in the end. Because while we're on the subject of the value of labor, there is currently such a shortage in\nmy\nfield that I'm definitely not getting fired if\nyou\nfail. I will still have a job... but will you be able to get one?', a user said: 'Totally agree! They see the world they will inherit and they see corruption everywhere. They see the adults not playing by their own rules with little consequence, so why should they as literal children? College is unaffordable, degrees don’t guarantee a job with a living wage. They’ve been shit on by the system for the last 5 years so now they’re withholding their labor as a defensive mechanism. Same thing as some adults.\nEdit: just to add, so many of our teens were/are frontline workers throughout this pandemic. They worked so many “essential” jobs at local grocery stores and restaurants. They saw their labor get exploited, and they are way more protective of their own labor now.'"
