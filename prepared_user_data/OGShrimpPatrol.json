I lead my entire team for 2 years and was insanely productive. We got a new global head who doesn’t like men. She gutted my position and gave all of my projects to women and told me I couldn’t get a promotion because she didn’t know me yet.\nGuess what, I’ve done about 10 minutes of work a day for the past few months while looking for new jobs. I’ve learned that working hard gets you jack shit so I’m collecting my money and phoning it in because they’re too stupid to notice.'"
