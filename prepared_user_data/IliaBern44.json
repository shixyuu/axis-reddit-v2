        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I feel the same and it has happened every trip I ever did - after around 10-14 Days I just feel exhausted and long for home. Luckily, my flights where always insured that I could get back into my cozy bed and predictable routine without having to pay for the extra flight back.\nI often meet people while traveling who travel for\nmonths\n- this sounds to me like hell on earth, like I said, after at most two weeks it all feels so tiresome. After the first few times this happened I learned to not plan longer than 12 days - and succesfully avoid that \"shut down\" you described - along with the intense feelings of exhaustion amd boredom that set in.\nI also found that it didn't necesseraly help to take \"days off\" like other people in the comments write, the bad feelings started to show either way.\nYou are not the only one.'"
