        "In response to 'I was a manager for 15 years before getting sick of it and moving back to the technical level of my profession.\nThis is just a negative term for what we used to call employee engagement.  If your employees aren't being productive, then you have a management and HR problem.  There are courses and consulting agencies that can help with this.\nThis stuff isn't rocket science.  If employees are doing a good job, they would like to hear that...let them know at least once a week.  Employees need to know what they do mattera to the company...make sure they know.  Employees need to feel that the company cares about them...make sure you have HR policies and benefits in place so they know that.  Employees need the right equipment and tools to get the job done...make sure they have them.  Employees want to be fairly compensated...so pay them a fair wage for their role.\nThere are several other things companies can do but I am not going to list them all here.\nCalling it \"quiet quitting\" or \"work to rule\" is just going to cause further engagement problems.', a user said: 'This man corporates.'"
