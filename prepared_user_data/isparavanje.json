        "In response to 'Chase your passions. I love what I do that's how I find meaning and motivation and energy to constantly do all the crazy things I'm always doing.\nPassion is not overrated.', a user said: 'Yeah, kinda sad that I had to go all the way to the bottom of the thread to find someone mentioning this. I get that not everyone can be in a job they love because there are jobs out there that just have to be done, so it's not the norm (not many passionate janitors out there probably, for example), but if you cultivate a passion you will find life to be much more fulfilling. Isn't that what truly matters?\nMost in this thread seem to be working purely for money, and if you are, I understand wanting to do the bare minimum. Just know that that isn't always necessarily the only way to live.'"
