        "In response to 'Or the government can channel the anger and resentment externally! History is rife with examples where restless, unemployed youth, especially men, can trigger one of the two possibilities  - start a revolution against the leaders at home or the leaders give them a gun and ask them to attack neighboring kingdoms/countries. Knowing China, i'd bet on the later.\nOne thing the entire world seems to have forgotten are the true covid death numbers in china, just extrapolating using US numbers and adjusting to income disparity China must have lost atleast 5 to 6 million people if not more. Don't know what that means for their domestic consumption.', a user said: 'This is my fear, not only is there a lot of underemployed young people, there's also just a lot of men relative to women in China right now. Official numbers estimate China's sex ratio demographics are ~52% men and ~48% women, that doesn't seem like a big disparity until you remember how big China's population is. The simple math bears out to around 18\nmillion\nmore men than women. Unless the Chinese suddenly pick up a huge polyandry fetish, a lot of those men are going to end up alone and unattached because there aren't enough partners of their preferred sex.\nAs you mentioned, sociological history shows a pretty stark pattern of what happens when you have too many underemployed, unattached men in your country. They either start breaking shit and causing unrest because they're angry and directionless, or they end up recruited into the country's military and used as manpower for meat grinding wars.\nAnd make no mistake, any attempt by China to take Taiwan, any of their southern neighbors, or their land disputes with India\nwill\nbe a meat grinder of huge proportions.'",
        "In response to 'China is not energy independent nor food independent. Any invasion that results in sanctions will likely lead to one of the biggest humanitarian crises in history.', a user said: 'I mean, you're talking about not just the country, but also the government who willingly initiated and plowed ahead with the \"Great Leap Forward\", despite the horrific famine and loss of life it caused. The CCP particularly, let alone China generally are no strangers to large scale humanitarian crises caused by their own government that benefit those in said government at the expense of the population.'",
        "In response to 'The men to women ratio that is able to reproduce is what you should be looking for. Older folks are still close to 50/50', a user said: 'Sure, I understand it's not literally 18 more million men in the current child bearing generations, but the problem is a disproportionate amount of the lopsided sex demographics are in the younger, child bearing age groups because of the One Child Policies from the past decades. During the One Child years, a lot of families were using what most countries would definitely consider cruel, unusual, and downright sadistic means to \"make sure\" that they had a male heir.\nMeans such as abandoning baby girls in the wilderness, or out on the street, leaving them for dead so they had another shot at trying for a boy who would then be able to carry on the family name. China began One Child policies in 1980 and only ended it in 2016, so every generation currently between the ages of 7 and 43, you know,\nall\nof the people currently at the end of, in the middle of, at the beginning of, and soon to be, prime child bearing age exist in a generation with this demographic problem.\nGuess what the prime ages for military recruitment are? They overlap quite a bit with prime child bearing ages as it turns out.'"
