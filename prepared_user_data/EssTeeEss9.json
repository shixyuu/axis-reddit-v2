        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I’ve always quiet quit. I’ve always done the least amount contractually possible because teaching is not my entire life. And I know this may come across as pessimistic, but teaching isn’t my passion. It’s something I do to survive in the world we’ve created. I’m pretty good at it, but I’m not pouring my existence into it the way I would if I was doing one of the hobbies I’m truly passionate about.\n*editing to say there are absolutely people who have that passion about teaching. My wife is one of them. Literally that one teacher who just changes your entire life/outlook when you take one of her classes. She’s that type of teacher, and I’m honestly in awe of her and wish I had the same gift/passion for it.'"
