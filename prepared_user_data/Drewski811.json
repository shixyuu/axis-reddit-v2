        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'It's an American thing, rather than British.\nAs a society, generally speaking, Brits do the work we're asked to do / paid to do. We don't have an expectation that people will go above and beyond on the regular unless there is a tangible reward for it.\nIn the US, it's different. They are expected to put a lot more in. If their working week is 40hrs, putting in less than 60 is seen as poor form.'"
