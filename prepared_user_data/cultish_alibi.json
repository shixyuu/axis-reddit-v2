        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'People are quiet quitting because the social contract fucking sucks. You work more, and you get less. Fewer people can afford a house, the earth is going to shit because corporations would rather see profits than a liveable atmosphere, capitalism is doing wealth redistribution, robbing from the poor and middle classes and giving to the rich.\nThe only reason most people work is to avoid homelessness. There's no incentive, no motivation when your life is 100% stick and no carrot.\nAnd the politicians and business owners see this, and they don't care, they don't make any effort to understand what people want, and the only solution they see is making life WORSE. Because if you beat your workers harder they will work harder, right?\nThe reality is that most people are deeply apathetic and with good reason. Why should we work 40, 50, 60 hours a week just so that billionaires can have even more billions? They aren't even doing anything with that money. They just fucking hide it in offshore tax-free accounts, or make dick-shaped rockets so they can go into space for 20 seconds while on earth people are starving to death.'"
