Quiet firing however, is when you work for the same company for years for little to no raises, value, or appreciation, and they keep adding responsibility to your plate.', a user said: 'Sadly at my work this has been going on for almost 10 years. I won't leave on my own as I've invested too much time and will get a great oension when retiring. Besides they would have to give me a nice package. So I'll just stay there dragging my ass while they keep loading more work until something snaps either way.'"
