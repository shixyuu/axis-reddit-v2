        "Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing. They just called it “mailing it in” and the movie Office Space is a commentary on this."
