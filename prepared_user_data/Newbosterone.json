        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! 🙏', a user said: 'Appearance is everything.  If you continue to appear to be a hard worker you can coast on your reputation.  Part of that is marketing yourself.  Accidentally finish something early?  Every now and then, admit it early!  “Hey Boss, I pushed to finish that job early so I could get your feedback before it’s due”.   Are they asking for volunteers?   If it’s better than what you’d be doing otherwise, step up. “I’m swamped but I can do that if someone helps with <task you hate>”.\nBtw, you’re always busy but don’t be too vocal about it.  No one trusts someone who’s never to busy to tell you they’re too busy.'"
