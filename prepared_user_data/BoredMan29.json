It didn't mean you had to do work, just look busy. That's basically the \"quiet quitting\" bullshit the media made up to shame people for doing their jobs, and my coworkers were doing that decades ago. It sounds like nothing's changed they just wrote a scolding article about it.'",
        "In response to 'if you weren't a smoker or not good at casually slacking off you end up overworking yourself in the process.  The system sucks for everyone, but the ones that were harming themselves were probably the folks that would have been high performers at an office that valued work ethics instead of blind loyalty to your boss.', a user said: 'All my coworkers were smokers, but they recently had made the office smoke-free, so everyone had to crowd into this tiny room with a big window and an enormous exhaust fan to smoke. It was like walking past the saddest zoo you'd ever seen. They usually found an excuse to do some off-site work to break up the day, but even so the hours are what really get ya. It's hard to have a life outside of work like that.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: New type of quitting discovered \"Quiet quitting is easy to identify; employees who are quiet quitters visibly reduce their effort and avoid going the extra mile. Soft quitting, on the other hand, happens quietly over time. Employees donâ€™t necessarily reduce their work output, but their enthusiasm fades, their curiosity dwindles, and their emotional connection to their work diminishes.\"\nThe cure is to lick the boot harder.', a user said: 'These are all just being invented as a way for executives to blame workers for being unable to make line go up more, right?'"
