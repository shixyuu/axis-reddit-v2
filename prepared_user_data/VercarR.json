Prefereably take a week completely off (PTO/holidays) and then stop over-archieving. \"Quiet quitting\" has such a negative ring, but moving back to 35 hours a week (7h days + 1h of sport/walk/nap every afternoon) to take care of your health can be an amazing decision. And you might find that if you are dedicated to use this free time to take care of your health you might even be more productive in this 35h than in whatever you worked before.\nGood luck, and hope you feel better soon!', a user said: 'Afternoon naps/relax have been the only way i was able to actually do work'"
