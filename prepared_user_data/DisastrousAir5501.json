        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting life I am quiet quitting life and nobody realizes that’s what it is. My friends think I’m just being a bad friend. My family just thinks I’m being a bad family member. I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live in the world any more. I just want to go to work and then come home and that’s it. I don’t want to go have dinner with people anymore. I don’t want to hang out and be made to feel obligated to stay until 11 pm before I can go home.  Nobody realizes that this is my way letting go of life, of escaping from the world.  I’m alone, I’m 30 years old and haven’t had an intimate partner for a decade. I love those in my life tremendously. But I just want to let go. When I’m home, I’m free to be who I want. To feel how I want, to look how I want. I can say what I want, my cat doesn’t mind. He doesn’t judge. He looks up to me and needs me and he’s the only thing that’s warm in my bed.  There’s nothing more signifícate to write here. Just thank you for listening.', a user said: 'Boy I can relate. My husband died and just this year my 36 yo son died. Then this past month my dog died and then 1 week later my cat died. I want to just give up, not even get out of bed. I have one son left and 2 beautiful grandaughters , and that’s the only thing that gets me up each day. But I know how people that are alone or lose significant people feel. So if you have family you love, appreciate them.'"
