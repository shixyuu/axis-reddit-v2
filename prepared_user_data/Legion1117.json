        "In response to 'I get if you want a promotion or to stand above your co workers you gotta work harder, accomplish more, and this usually means extra hours.\nThe reality is that for YEARS people have been doing all of that extra work, with the expectation that doing so would result in raises and promotions. But those rewards simply don't materialize. I'm Gen X and I learned a long time ago that employers will always have a reason to not give raises.\nThe real trick is to re-train those who are still brainwashed to not do the above-and-beyond. They probably have noticed the rewards are like the cake (\"the cake is a lie\") but they're scared that if they stop overworking they'll get laid off.', a user said: 'I'd upvote you twice for the cake reference if I could. Just re-played both those last week. :)'"
