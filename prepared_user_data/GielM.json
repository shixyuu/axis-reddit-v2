        "In response to 'I work in a union shop, and when my supervisors piss me off I do\nexactly\nwhat I'm told. . . . . . . And\nONLY\nwhat I'm told.\nWorking as instructed still means you need to be instructed.\nI also regularly admonish new hires for working off the clock. They don't start paying us until exactly start time, so if you come in early, even if you punch in, they don't pay you until you were scheduled to start.\nI think this is a stupid rule, so when I get there early I sit on the conveyor belt that is required for work to happen and play on my phone. They can't turn the belt on if someone is on it, so if they want to start working they have to ask me to move.', a user said: 'I've actually yelled at co-workers who were not taking their breaks.\nOur half-hour break is unpaid. So you DO NOT fucking skip it. It's fine to pospone it. If a supervisor asks you to work through it, he's asking you to break the local labor laws, and you should come tell me so I can yell at the supervisor. But take your fucking break!'"
