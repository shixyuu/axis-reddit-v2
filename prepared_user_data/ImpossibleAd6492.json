I’m nearing 40 and I’m unsure I can continue to work this way for a long period of time, it’s exhausting. Being in the office would be a perk, but accommodating a 1.5 hr commute + going straight into back to back meetings for 5+ hrs does not feel fun even thinking about the logistics to make it happen.'"
