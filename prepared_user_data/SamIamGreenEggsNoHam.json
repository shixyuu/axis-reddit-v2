        "In response to 'I learned a long time ago that you get the same 2.5% raise as everyone else regardless.\nI'm only now coming to understand that my stellar attendance does not, in fact, matter. I\nnever\nget sick and so I never take sick time.  I've got so many unused days built up...\nAnd I recently realized that I'm only doing it because I feel a sort of pride about being \"the guy who never calls out.\"\nBut fucking\nwhy?\nAs you indicated, it doesn't affect my pay either way, so screw it man--starting this year I've been taking the occasional mental health day. I have a really cool apartment, I deserve to spend some time there!', a user said: 'Please don't take this as a criticism since you've already had your epiphany!\nI've always viewed the guy who never calls out as someone who's either bad at time management or has no hobbies. Not judgmentally, but kind of in an empathetic way. Like, you can't think of anything at all you'd like to get paid to do on your day off? It's PAID!! I love the feeling of waking up on my paid day off and just telling myself I'm getting paid for everything I do.\nWatching star wars in my underwear? Paid. Eating waffles? Paid. Poop in my own toilet? Paid paid paid. I carry absolutely ZERO vacation time and it disturbs the hell out of my coworkers and bosses. I don't care, I'm happy getting paid to do shit other than work. There are so many different ways to get a day, a week, a month+ off in an emergency. USE YOUR TIME OFF PEOPLE. LIVE.'",
        "In response to 'In my case if I call out I lose overtime. So, one day of calling out will cost me almost $400 in OT. So I try to plan large chunks of time off to avoid missing OT', a user said: 'My crusade against OT is for another day!'"
