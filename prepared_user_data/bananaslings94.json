        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'My MIL is one of these people. She sees the hypocrisy but she told me she’s afraid to entertain the idea that it might all be wrong because she will have wasted her whole life.'",
        "In response to '🤦🏼🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ Geez, so she continues to waste what's left of her life.  Must be the threat of shunning that's actually still keeping her locked in??', a user said: 'Yeah she doesn’t want to lose her friends, and there is also “but what if they are right?” Worry. I think she’ll very very slowly walk away.'",
        "In response to 'I hope she does slowly walk away.', a user said: 'Thank you, me too'"
