        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'After years of working in retail and restaurants I learned to just do the bare minimum not to get fired. Going \"above and beyond\" got me nothing except more responsibility at the same pay. Everything broke for me when I got a performance review in about 2010. I got a 3/5 and I asked my manager about it. He said that I was an exceptional worker but he gives everyone a 3/5 to avoid showing favoritism. You owe your employer nothing except what you were hired to do.'"
