        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'Finally some truth instead of what I see on tik tok about how a  “20 year old is making 200k a year in tech sales and it’s so easy!”\nI would say the “quiet quitting” term is super misrepresented. It just means doing your job without working after hours or going “above an beyond”. I did that in the past and all I had to show for it was poor sleep, my hairline falling back, and gaining fat. It wasn’t worth it.\nAs for what I do now in sales. It’s a means to an end and it’s a skill I have so I’ll stick to it. And it pays the bills. But I’m not going to work absurd hours for an extra gold star or to just realize In 5 months my comp plan is changing for more output and less pay.'"
