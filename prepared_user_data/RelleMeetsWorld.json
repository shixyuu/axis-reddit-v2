        "In response to 'Original Post: Homer Simpson (1995) explaining quiet quitting 27 years before people thought quiet quitting was a new thing. [External Link]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYXzHjbfMDk', a user said: 'Quiet quitting (and I hate that term, it was invented by management) isn't even doing your job half assed. It's doing it full assed, but no more. No putting in extra hours without compensation, no answering emails from home, keeping a clear separation of your work life and your home life.\nIt's doing your job as written and not busting your ass for the promise of some vague future reward.'"
