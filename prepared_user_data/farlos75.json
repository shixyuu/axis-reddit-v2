[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'The former is a kind of classist propoganda and the latter is your job., though both refer to the same thing'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'Speaking as an employer, if you work late, you should have the option to leave early later.\nIf you work above and beyond, you should expect some form of gratification. Maybe a bonus, maybe extra time off, maybe a free lunch or some decent booze but some form of recognition.\nOtherwise you're not going to feel valued and then you're work won't matter as much to you and then the quality will decrease which affects the whole company.'"
