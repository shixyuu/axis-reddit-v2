        "In response to 'Inflation is a bitch\nIf they did not believe they could get it they would not be asking for it\nQuiet quitting is not a thing. Your company pays for 8 hours as per the contract.\nIf you are down to a single admin your company needs to cave and hire someone on before disaster.\nIf they are asking for 120+ and you wont pay that, you should list the salary in the listing.', a user said: 'Inflation is what I was thinking. $120K a year isn't nearly as much now as it used to be, even if you only go back 10 years or so. Of course workers are going to demand more pay as things get more expensive, that's only fair and everyone should be asking for higher wages.'"
