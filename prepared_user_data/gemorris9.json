        "In response to 'This happened to me at my last job, it ended up being a department of 4 FTE + 1 Temp going down to just me. I quit shortly after that, they asked if they could offer me more money to stay and I told them I wouldn't even hear the offer.', a user said: 'My store at a large chain has about 16-18 employees when I came in to the store as the GM. At the end there was 3 of us plus me and I was still operating the store but at a noticable drop in everything. There was zero urgency to up pay passed 10 an hour. Zero urgency to up pay passed 12 for assistants.\nThey had me fill out a business report of surrounding businesses to prove I couldn't hire. The DQ next door was the lowest paying business. 14 an hour for 14 year olds. 18 an hour hour for 16+ and 22 for assist managers. Even though I was technically salaried and working much less hours then expected, it was still shocking to find out that if I had actually followed the policy on hours the fucking dq Assistant manager made 5 more an hour.'"
