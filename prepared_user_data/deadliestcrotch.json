They decided they wanted us to move from a flexible schedule to a rigid one and \"gave people the option\" to decide whether they could make the change or have to leave the company.\nIt conflicted with another part-time job I had at the time so I just never did it and waited to be laid off. Eventually 2 of the managers call me basically trying coerce me to quit since I can't keep with their new schedule and we fought back and forth on it. Eventually I was terminated for \"behavioral issues\" lol.\nUnemployment didn't side with em tho.', a user said: 'That’s because a significant change like that to your schedule or work environment are no different than being laid off.

Workers always have some leverage, they need to organize.', a user said: 'But with a slowdown you have to actually show up to an office'"
