        "In response to 'Original Post: The Flipside of \"quiet quitting\" is quiet paying. Don't forget this. Somebody older I know asked me why young people are \"quiet quitting\" their jobs and not trying to work hard. I told them that quiet quitting is a bullshit term that describes doing what was outlined in your contract, and not more. He started to tell me how you need to hustle and do more than the minimum if you want to succeed. I told him that the difference compared to many years ago is that now hard work is not met with commensurate rewards or opportunities. Then I asked him the following question:\nIf it is culturally acceptable to push people to go above and beyond what is outlined in their contract, why does the company always only pays what was agreed upon? Why doesn't payroll ever go above and beyond what was agreed? Shouldn't it also be culturally acceptable to expect extra salary in this case? Aren't my company quiet paying me?\nHe had nothing to say and just looked uncomfortable. He didn't really agree but he has no good answer either.', a user said: 'I think this “hard work” they engaged in was a myth.  They tell it to make themselves sound better.\nThose “glory days” were glory days because some things were EASY for them, they were handed to them.\nThey say they pounded the pavement, walked boldly into places asking for work. That was because you COULD do that.  Graduate high school with no skills, just walk down the street and easily get hired at the local factory.  And you’d get a decent job for good pay at a place that would be loyal to you, and you could raise a family.\nThey assume because they got those things, they MUST have worked hard to get them, right?\nAnd that attitude of working “above and beyond?”  That’s bogus too.  There was massive growth then.  You’d work a while, and someone needed to be a manager, so the guy who had been there longest was promoted.  Then the next guy, then the next.  They didn’t “burn the midnight oil,” they just stayed at the company that was happy to have them, and got promoted when it was their turn.\nThey (white males at least) were born into an unprecedented time where things for them were EASY and everything was just handed to them on a silver platter.  Then they invented the myth that all that easy stuff wasn’t easy, it was their hard work that got them where they were, and that means that the world today is lazy and soft because they can’t easily get the same things.'"
