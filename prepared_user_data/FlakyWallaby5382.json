Sit around do nothing. Only brown nosers and power hungry people climb the ladder to find a paper or glass ceiling. While privalegedged people fall ass backwards into making good mistakes\nDuring a good period of it you could smoke and drink. All we got is reddit now.'",
        "In response to 'People who get smart stop working as hard\nLearned that lesson early in my career. Sadly, I kept forgetting it starting out.\nWould get the \"Cost of living\" increase of 2% every year. More than many get, but was not matching what I saw in the store.\nBusted my ass, 80 hour weeks. Leading multiple projects. Would get an A+ review and a ... 4% raise.  I mean, it'd double the previous year but again but at best matched the price of a gallon of milk.\nSo I did the math. Looked at all the extra work outside 40 hours I was putting in. Divided it by the extra 2% (exceptional raise - normal raise) and found out that I was getting less than minimum wage for those extra hours.\nAnd before someone chimes in. Yes, I did bust my ass and got a 'raise' that basically made up for the cost of living misses I had before.\nAnd yeah, I did end up changing jobs. And that's only way to get a real raise but you are also a bit limited in how often you do it. (can't do it every 6 months typically forever)', a user said: 'Other way is to get more education as your onus for moving on.\nEg i got my bachelors… changed jobs… got my project management cert… new job…'",
        "In response to 'You don't need a reason (real stretch using onus there...) to change jobs other than the market rate for your position increasing. Very low effort to increase pay by 10-20% for a side move that will likely lead to a decrease in responsibility at first due to on-boarding, etc.\nI hopped companies for 15 years every 10-18 months, started applying for new jobs as soon as I settled in.', a user said: 'What is your niche skill? Most of us are admin generalists'",
        "In response to 'Lol...\nI was a general manager for food service. I've worked catering, country-club, retail, fine dining... Started at like $35k in 2006 and was making more than $100k after bonuses by 2012.\nLeft the industry in 2020 to work in a hospital, with a massive pay cut, cause i did nothing but save and invest during those years and it's time to chill.', a user said: 'Burning the candle on both ends is a strategy… long term no… short term yes'",
        "In response to '100%. That's why I didn't stay with any company. They would chew up managers like tissue paper, so I had no loyalty out of the gates. I've worked for a lot of big brands too. Starbucks, Shake Shack, Pret A Manger, Chop'T, Just Salad.\nFunnily enough, just taking care of the staff properly ended up making the companies lots of money, and made my job super easy. So my businesses always looked super successful and made it easy to job hop.', a user said: 'It really is about solving others problems, not being an asshole and simply turning up.'",
        "In response to 'Not really sure. I have tried to get an answer as the down slide began right around my cancer diagnosis. She has since claimed she was over it long before then.\nWe argued more, but I also felt she stopped being half a relationship and decided she wanted what she wanted and was going to do what she wanted.\nMind you I spent much of our marriage adjusting to make her happy. I have virtually no friends because she would always start a fight if I tried to hang out with friends. My only friends where her friends significant others.', a user said: 'Not that this is right but I believe when her rock turned to jello. She got scared. She is the weak one not you.'"
