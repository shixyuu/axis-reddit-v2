        "In response to 'Original Post: It’s now “quiet quitting” to not go beyond your job responsibilities [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/rb5pth0h04i91.jpg', a user said: 'This is why corporate culture is so fucking exhausting. Every little concept has to have a brandable name, and have no context outside of an office environment. And they don't really give any context to the concepts themselves anyway. In fact, in the case of \"quiet quitting\" I would argue that if you're still getting a paycheck, you haven't quit.\nIt really feels like people are creating a while new language specifically to communicate with shareholders/ investors.\nThe corporate world is so disconnected from the real world'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'You know, I really can't tell. Part of me suspects that articles like this are commissioned, or are written by business owners who have enough time to bullshit opinion pieces in business magazines.\nThese really don't seem to serve a purpose other than telling CEOs what they want to hear and manufacturing corporate slang.\nI dunno, business magazines are a weirdly sterilized medium.'"
