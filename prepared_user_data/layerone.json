        "In response to 'But if you could fire someone and be free and clear, constructive dismissal is fine... but then, why would the employer be doing it?\nSometimes it's because the petty supervisor can't directly fire someone without showing they had a real problem and tried to improve the situation, but still has enough independent authority to make someone they don't like's working life into a living hell.', a user said: 'Probably doesn't have the authority because company doesn't want to pay unemployment, and leaves that decision to the higher ups. Which then goes into your scenario described, which is constructive dismissal, which in most cases should qualify you for unemployment anyway.\nTakeway, document everything. When you get hired, get it writing what your standard work hours per week should be. If it's 25hr, and they drop you to 5hr, now you have in writing to prove your case.\n\"I only accepted the job because I was promised at least 25hr a week, and I accepted the job because that was enough to pay for my bills, I would have no accepted the job if I was offered lower hours.\"\nBoom, unemployment approved.'"
