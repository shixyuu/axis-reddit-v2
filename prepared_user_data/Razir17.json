        "In response to 'Moat of the older generation don't have a work life balance. They use work to mask other problems in there life/relationship/etc.  I know of at least 4 people at my current job who work extended hours because they don't wanna go home and be a parent to their kids, also fucking over the mom. It's frigging disgusting.', a user said: 'I work with some of those types except they also complain about work all day. They come in way before their scheduled time, in an hourly pay position so they aren’t being paid until their scheduled time. Then complain that other people are only here for the time they’re being paid for. Meanwhile they do less work than the people that just do their scheduled time.\nIt’s really sad honestly. Work is the only thing they know but they’re also bitter and jaded and hate work but won’t retire because it’s all they have. Vicious cycle of miserableness that spreads to others around them.'"
