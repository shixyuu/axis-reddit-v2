        "In response to 'I'm pretty sure I would have lost my shit too, I can't stand being asked simple questions that could have been answered by someone simply doing their job properly for 2 minutes.  Especially when said person is above me in the chain.', a user said: 'Well, I see some of you haven't been in the business world long.  It is the exception rather than the rule to have actually read the fucking material which will be discussed in the meeting.\nNow, I've been on both sides... The one thing I was known for in meetings was limiting the scope and time.  \"Your question doesn't pertain to what we are trying to decide here... Follow up later.\" Sometimes I didn't have time to read critical material... Because I was stuck in meetings most of the day.\nI totally don't blame OP.'",
        "In response to 'New to corporate here but old to management fuck ups on both ends.\nKey here is to retort unprofessionalism with utmost professionalism. It's hard but it's the best option. Tell them that you don't have time to discuss the issue/that question during the presentation and that you'll 'try' to answer questions at the end of your presentation. Oh you ran out of time. You can direct questions to my email and I'll answer as soon as possible.\nProceed to quit then.\nIt's hard especially when OP had put so much work and been under so much stress and anxiety as of late but it's something to take going forward. If in doubt, give yourself time and space so you can answer properly later or at least strategise.', a user said: 'Absolutely the right way.'"
