Your response is “Y”.\nThey respond back that they really need you to do “X”.\nYou’re like, “Ok…”\nNext annual review, you were exemplary in doing “X”. Clients were super happy with you doing “X”.\nBut in your annual review the following year you didn’t get that promotion or raise because they based it on your performance on “Y”. The initial thing you wanted to do. And they keep giving you projects in the meantime throughout the year that no one else wants.\nEdit: grammatical errors.'"
