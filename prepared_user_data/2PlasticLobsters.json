        "In response to 'Importantly, you are actually HARMING your organization if you end up doing the work of 2 or 3 people.\nYou will, eventually, move on.  You might get a better gig.  You might move so your kids have better opportunities.  You might get hit by a bus.\nYour company is then going to have to replace you... and find out they can't.  They'll have to get 3 full time people to replace one person.  This is no bueno.\nThis isn't 'quiet quitting' or 'working your wage'.  This is common sense.  Do a good job, but don't put in unpaid hours, EVER.  Don't do undocumented work.  EVER.\nDon't be a single point of failure.', a user said: 'This happened when a former coworker of mine left. She'd been working nights & weekends for years, not taking vaca, etc. The organization just kept giving her more & more work. She'd tried to explain that deadlines were only being met at the expense of her health. They literally told her to \"work smarter, not harder\".\nHaving gotten nothing better than a useless platitude in response, she left not long after. They literally replaced her with 3 people.'"
