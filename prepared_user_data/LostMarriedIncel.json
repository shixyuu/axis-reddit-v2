I've explained it's just off putting to me and really kills any desire I have to even want to initiate. In my mind there is just going to be some kind of remark about any touching etc.\nEarlier tonight I come home from.work..she says hold out your hand...and says hi roomie..I lean in for a kiss in a playful manner and get the dont touch me speil....instantly  killed any type of desire I have.\nIm eating dinner alone, as she's in the bedroom, probaly playing some game on here phone. Got the dont talk to me, dont come near me Yada yada...\nJust venting....', a user said: 'Sorry bro, but I feel better that my wife at least likes me. Damn, this sub is a mind-f*ck.'"
