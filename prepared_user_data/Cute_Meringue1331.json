I leave work on time while performing to the standards set. If the standards include OT , then im out, i start searching.\nThis allows me to have hobbies and social life.\nYou are in the business of selling your time and skills for money. Don't let the buyers lowball you.\nLife is short , work is just one aspect of living.', a user said: 'I always have nothing to do at work, bc every company i go to, i write macros that automate my excel tasks very fast. The bottleneck is waiting for other dept to get back to me'",
        "In response to 'I lay flat already.  I don’t chase after material goods that normal people want.  No fancy cars for me.  No overpriced clothing bags and what nots for me.  I don’t really care because to be honest expensive doesn’t mean better quality.\nI have enough money to live within my means and I have time to play games, exercise, and read novels that I love.  I live my life as is and I’m happy.\nNot thinking about kids either because that’s whole responsibility I don’t want.  And if people complain about “who’s going to take care of you when you get old?”  No one.  I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m dependent on others to live.  I’ll save up money so I can get euthanasia in another country when I’m getting old.', a user said: 'I cant lay flat bc i need to achieve my goals which is to be able to afford grandma's cancer treatment and sister's uni education in australia'"
