OP's boss is a narcissist.', a user said: 'I would say that there's just something about dog grooming, but I know what it is already.\nNarcissists like having complete control and the opportunity to inflict pain and abuse on living things under the guise of their job.

Also, dogs are overly loyal, and put up with the abuse.'"
