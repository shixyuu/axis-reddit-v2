        "In response to 'If you are doing your job and keeping things running, then whatâ€™s the problem? Why are employees always expected to go above and beyond? More work for no extra pay.', a user said: 'i had a manager tell me that i was 'for some reason' leaving at 5 everyday and then went onto compare to me to a government employee\nNeedless to say it didnt work out between me and her. This happened 9 years ago but jokes on her though, her making me switch teams was the trigger for the chain of events that ended up with me landing a job in tech last year.\nIf anything it made me realize - albeit years later - that I didn't have to put up with that bullshit constantly being threated with my job. Anyone dealing with shit like this at work you're more valuable than some shitty manager regardless of how great the company may look on your CV. Its not worth being under that stress and losing your confidence. Go find something else even if its worse, you can always bounce back. Your career wont be defined by whatever job you land after college. You can find yourself doing something completely different unrelated to your college degree or that first job 5-10 years or shit basically at any point in your career.'"
