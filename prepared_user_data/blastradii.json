        "In response to 'yeah it's an insidious idea that doing only what you're asked is somehow less than the job requirement.  It doesn't make any sense that the default mode is \"above and beyond\" that completely negates the point of \"above and beyond\" if \"everyone\" is doing it as a baseline.', a user said: 'When I order a salad at a restaurant. I pay the restaurant for the salad. I don’t complain because the restaurant didn’t go above and beyond to give me a free steak. That’s moronic logic.'",
        "In response to 'It reminds me of the story of the welder who replies to an ad offering $16-30/hr. He does one good enough, but ultimately shitty weld, then does a beautiful weld that shows his skill and craftsmanship. Then tells the interviewers: the first is what you’ll get from me for $16, the second is $30.\nThis is the reaction of millions of people being taught that raises/promotion requires that extra effort, just for the company to hire from outside instead of promoting within. I will do what I am required and nothing else, unless it benefits a friend/coworker (maybe taking a shorter lunch here and there to help them button up a project). If you want more, I will need to be compensated for more.', a user said: 'The welder should have done a shitty weld for $16 then less shitty weld for $30. Then do the beautiful weld and say that’s for going over the range and we can talk numbers if you’re willing to negotiate.'",
        "In response to 'This joke is pretty old. I first heard it in HS in the mid 2000’s. I’m sure it could be updated for sake of amounts. The point was the effort-income ratio.', a user said: 'I know. I’m just being facetious :-)'"
