        "In response to 'Yes! Any time\nquiet quitting\nis brought up I always correct this to\nActing your Wage\nEmployees are finally starting to wake up to the fact that going above and beyond no longer will get you a raise or promotion instead work is rewarded with more work and good work is rewarded with a job title change with more responsibilities at the same pay rate you were at before.', a user said: 'Yep, I had a buddy that still works at my old employer...he has been there almost 15 years and has had a promotion dangled in front of him for the past 5 years. He finally got sick of it, secured a new job that would have started in like two weeks... and my previous employer is now trapping him by withholding his almost $20k bonus due to a new policy that was basically implemented to prevent people from resigning after they forced them back into the office next month.\nHe needs that bonus to pay for the rest of his year, and his new employer isn't budging on his start date because they want him onboarded before the new FY cycle begins in October. So basically he's being forced to stay and missing out on the new opportunity. It's a bullshit power play from a bullshit leadership team to hold people hostage for 6 more months, tbh.'"
