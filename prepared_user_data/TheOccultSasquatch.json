        "In response to 'Act your wage.', a user said: 'This. In the summer i started working in a warehouse helping out on the Amazon station along with 3 others who had been there a while. It was simple packing, Mon-Fri 9-5.\nBut then the owner had the genius idea to switch to 12 hour days, 4 on 4 off. So the two people that'd been there the longest quit, and because there's now two separate shifts, me, who's been there for a month and a half, is left to run the whole station on my own. So now i'm left to do the work of 3 people, for minimum wage. But wait, they're handing out improved contracts. So i could potentially get an extra 50 PENCE to do the work of three people!!\nTwo hours into my first 12 hour shift i walked out, and i don't feel guilty about it either. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.'"
