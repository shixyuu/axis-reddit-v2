        "In response to 'When I start new jobs I’ll ask people who have been there for a while to tell me wild stories about previous employees so I can secretly gauge what will and won’t get me fired in the future.', a user said: 'I got one for you, dude and a girl are talking, friendly with each other, flirting and what not. Dude brings her a gift for Valentine's Day, a giant dildo in a brown bag. Gives it to her in the lunch room in front of everyone, she flips out, starts screaming at him and they get in a fight. They both go to HR and he's told to leave her alone, next day they get in a fight during lunch, he's brought to HR and told to leave her alone. Leaves that meeting passes her in the hall and a big screaming match, that's when they fired him, so giving a girl a dildo was not bad enough for termination.'"
