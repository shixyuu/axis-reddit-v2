        "In response to 'I'm in the same boat as you. Truth is I do around 40 hours of work during the 5 days of close, then maybe 10 hours over the next 3 weeks. Loud speakers to notify me of Teams and emails coming in, and a mouse jiggler to stay active. My job requires a lot of access to medical records so I'm 99% sure they can't use any type of tracking software. Anyhow last 3 years I've gotten good raises and exceeded expectations on annuals. Unlike you I've made a point to answer emails asap and volunteer for any project. The thing I think I'm messing up with though is turning down promotions. I was a manager in my last company, and dropped to senior in this company purely for the full remote job. I just love the ease of the job I currently have and don't want to be over 4-5 people on a team.', a user said: 'I’m in a similar situation to yours. The last 2 years have been pretty smooth sailing. My job is pretty simple, and my manager and director both have praised my work. I feel like I’m not really working hard, maybe a couple hours of work stretched out to last a day.\nI’m on the fence of taking a promotion, the incremental pay is probably 15% more money, but the work load will change quite dramatically. I’m also getting kind of bored. Why haven’t you worked your way back up to a management role?'",
        "In response to 'In short it's about 25% more money with 3x the work. I know if you can work up to director or vp levels it's a lot more money, but I'm a simple guy. No family I need to take care of and no desire to get one. I just don't need the money and it would just get dumped into my 401k/roth, which is already set at 20%.', a user said: 'That’s fair. Sounds like you are in a pretty sweet spot then.'"
