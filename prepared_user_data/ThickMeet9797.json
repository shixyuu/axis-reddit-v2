        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'You are doing your job. That’s it. I think setting those boundaries is healthy. We’ve realized as teachers that working our butts off doesn’t lead to anything. You don’t get promotions in education based on merit. You get them based on degrees. Just give 100% during your contract time. After that, your time is yours. Those papers can wait to be graded. This is my 6th year and I’m not sure how long I’ll last. No idea what my options are but I may start looking for other employment opportunities.'"
