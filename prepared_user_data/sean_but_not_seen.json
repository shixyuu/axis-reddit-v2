        "In response to '^\nHonestly.\nI don't get how anyone is getting traction on this whole concept of \"doing your job as per the description is a form of 'quitting.'\" The job description lays out the duties and the rate of pay for them. Playing that whole \"I want to talk to you about your flair\" game is nothing but an effort on your employer's part to get more than they're paying for.', a user said: 'The way I interpret it to make sense to me is that what you’re quitting isn’t your job, it’s quitting the bullshit rat race to outperform your peers to earn a raise/promotion.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: \"Quiet Quitting\" is a bullshit gaslighting term. Don't let it become an acceptable term [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/fwj0foce59k91.jpg', a user said: 'The term just means quietly quitting the bullshit rat race in every company surrounding trying to outperform peers to get recognized for promotion. I’m not sure why people think it’s gaslighting. I’m sticking with the term. It describes a trend in behavior not a person. Believe me, it’s scaring the shit out of executives. If they’re the one gaslighting with the term it’s blowing up in their faces.'"
