If he shows up on time and has all the appearance of coaching he can still be paid.', a user said: 'Get the big buyout. Go coach another program for $4 million a year without the crazy expectations. Work smarter not harder.'",

        "In response to 'I feel like I would definitely have a clause in the contract where any money you make at another school is subtracted from what we owe you or something like that.\nOr maybe if you take another FBS job during the 10-year period then we subtract 20% from your total or something and then it goes up to 40% if you take an SEC job and 60% if you take a job in the same division.\nIt's basically the only way to prevent someone from \"sucking\" , taking the money and then just blaming some external factor and taking another job to get even more money. Granted it would only work once but if he was fired this year I guarantee some other school would still take a chance on him', a user said: 'There might be.'"
