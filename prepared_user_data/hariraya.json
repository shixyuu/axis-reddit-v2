        "In response to 'I fundamentally do not agree with the premise of \"Quiet Quitting\". What even is  bare minimum?\nIf your task is X, and meron kang deadline, or quota, or number of hours, etc. and you hit that, that is not bare minimum, that is doing the job you and your employer agreed on. That's a job well done.\nThe problem here is that businesses want you to kill yourself and go the extra mile without giving you your due, kaya gumagawa ng mga bagong buzz words to make people feel bad about \"doing the bare minimum\".', a user said: 'Bakit parang kasalanan ng empleyado na hindi malinaw ang standards ng amo niya? Employers define what the “bare minimum” is tapos they will hold it against the employee for meeting their standards? Hindi ba dapat sa simula pa lang ay meron nang criteria for retention and promotion? If possible, dapat nga pati yung career path mo within the firm, agency, or company should be defined.\nIf you meet your KPIs, why should it be held against you?\nSaw comments on Facebook na wala raw uunlad kung ganyan ang mindset at weakshit raw mga empleyado ngayon. Employees will be more than willing to go the extra mile if they are compensated fairly, they are given clear and reachable objectives to qualify for bonuses, and the employer sticks to their word.'"
