        "In response to '\"Winning is easy, son; governing is harder.\"\nI don't want to say that the Taliban winning outright is in any sense good--but it did cause the organization to face a test that it never had before and it was woefully unprepared to handle. Governing is a much harder task than simply winning the right to govern, and the Taliban having a bit of a \"put up or shut up\" kind of moment here really takes the wind out of its sails. This is why it's so important to allow the winners to govern. Either they rise to the challenge and figure it out, or they prove themselves unfit and are replaced by someone who is.\nThe wrench there is that the Taliban proving itself unfit is way more concerning than other political entities simply being not good at their job. But overall the point that the Taliban probably isn't best defeated by military invasion rings true. Afghanistan is going through a period of metamorphosis and it's messy and horrible, but there's real hope that they are sowing the seeds of success in the future.', a user said: 'I don’t know how the Taliban is going to balance all the political constituencies of the country, particularly with the large “new urbanite” demographic. Something like 40% of afghanis are under 15. Large new constituencies formed during that period that are not very excited about Taliban rule on both flanks. Some are extremists even by Taliban standards and are engaged in an insurgency, and some are more modernist and unhappy with Taliban policies, particularly in major cities. There also is the question of non-Pashtun ethnic minorities that enjoyed significantly more equality under the U.S. administration and are unhappy.'"
