        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'I've literally always just done my job, only going \"above and beyond\" when it was to make my own job easier. But I have found ways to tone it down even more since the rto mandate.'",
        "In response to 'Do you think a lot of people will \"tone it down\" to punish their companies for RTO?', a user said: 'Short answer is yes. I'd argue different reasons all around - some may think of it as \"getting back at,\" some will see it as a fair trade, others will just be burnt out from returning to 5x commute per week during likely worse hours (I could leave early and finish days from home, missing the worst of the traffic since I come in early). Plenty of other reasons people will have - but we can all have our own reasons. =)'"
