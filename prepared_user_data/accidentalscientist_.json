        "In response to 'Doing the job I’m paid to and nothing more? Why is that considered quitting. I mean they’re paying the minimum requirement', a user said: 'Jobs expect you to always go above and beyond to try to get a pay raise and promotion. You won’t get a raise if you don’t do more. But also most jobs I’ve had won’t actually compensate you for the extra, they just expect it for your current wage.\nI’m working a job now where when I do extra, it’s recognized and appreciated and I’ve received decent raises, bonuses, and a promotion from it. Now I’ll do above my job description because I know it will be compensated during raise/bonus time. I’ve never experienced that before.'",
        "In response to 'I use to be a mailman. If you were good at your job you were rewarded with more work. Part timers worked 7am-7:30pm, Full timers worked 7am-3:30pm. When I became full time I would finish my route and have an hour or an hour and a half to spare.\nI knew if I went back they would give me more work to do, so I would just sit around until it was a safe time to go back to the station.', a user said: 'I worked at FedEx as a preload shift truck loader. I learned that if I loaded my trucks well and efficiently, I’d just be given more trucks to load at the same time, which meant all my trucks were loaded sloppy. So I’d be loading 6 and a bad coworker would have 2. And we got paid the same. But also that person would get cut early and surprise! I got the luxury of finishing off and fixing their trucks.\nIt took too long to learn to limit myself and make it look like I’m struggling because if I am doing my best and doing well, I got more work and none of my trucks were good anymore. And for the same pay rate, I was doing 6 and my coworker was doing 2. And I got “rewarded” with working late nearly every day to fix their mess.'"
