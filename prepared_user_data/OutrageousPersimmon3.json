        "In response to 'Original Post: Minnesota among top 5 states for quiet quittingâ€™ [External Link]: https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-quiet-quitting-jobs-2022', a user said: 'Someone please chalk quiet quitting up there with the great resignation on our list of bullshit the media is trying to feed people. Opportunities have opened up with millions of boomers retiring, and now suddenly no one wants to work, or if we do work, we're not willing to work on our off time, so shame on us. Shame on a media that reports this load of stench with a straight face because the corporate overlords whose pay increases outpace ours by over 100% tell them to. Companies have better budgets for hiring outside than inside, and so employees' best bets are actually to go look elsewhere if they want a stronger increase. I spent a lot of years in middle management and will attest to that, at least for the places I've worked. And then left for better pay & opportunities.'"
