        "In response to 'Original Post: MacDonald: 'Quiet quitting'? No, it's just work-to-rule â€” and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'The older I get, the more I focus on results rather than \"hard work\". When I look at my investments,  I care about the bottom number, not how much time my advisor put in. If I get knee surgery,  I care about if my knee works, not how many hours the doctor was in there.'"
