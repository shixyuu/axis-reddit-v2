        "In response to 'Not only that, this is not a new thing. This is a well documented, well known economic phenomenon. When employees do not feel like their compensation is enough for the effort that they put into the job, their productivity drops. And it eventually reached an equilibrium point. Where the effort an employee puts in is equivalent to their pay.\nOne of Janet Yellen's claims to game was a paper she wrote on the inverse of this phenomenon. She wrote a paper with her husband about the net financial benefits for a company to intentionally overpay their employees. Paying an employee significantly more than they feel they are worth causes them to put more effort into their jobs and makes them feel more respected, more needed, and more fulfilled. The financial benefit from the increased productivity usually outweighed the increased cost.', a user said: 'Paying an employee significantly more than they feel they are worth causes them to put more effort into their jobs and makes them feel more respected, more needed, and more fulfilled.\nI've never studied that on the macro scale, but I've personally never seen it fail to work, on myself included.'"
