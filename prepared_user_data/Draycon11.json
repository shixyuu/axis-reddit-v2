        "In response to 'Original Post: [The Philippine Star] \"Quiet quitting\" is taking over the workplace â€“ what exactly does it mean? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'Reading through a lot of the comments, it sounds like a lot of people are being treated unfairly by their companies which is unfortunate. Definitely makes sense not to do more than what's required in that case.\nThe difficult part is that it's hard for 100% of employees to all be on the same page. It just takes one person to do more for that person to get all the promotions and benefits in an organization that's functioning properly. That's where this culture probably stemmed from because people just naturally want to get ahead and organizations naturally want to reward their best. If you're ok with getting passed on promotions and benefits for these other people, then sounds like everyone is getting what they want.\nOn the other side of the coin, I have also dealt with people that do the bare minimum and expect to be rated highly, those people are delusional.'"
