        "In response to 'Original Post: /u/x_v_b explains how the sudden ubiquity of the buzz-phrase \"quiet quitting\" is really just a PR exercise to discourage workers from standing up against wage theft by employers [External Link]: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/x0feqg/whats_up_with_all_these_articles_about_quiet/im91pkm/?context=3', a user said: 'Sorry but I don’t see this comment as bestof material. The person makes an authoritative claim but doesn’t show any evidence. I’d like to see a source that companies developed this phrase as a PR exercise - which companies exactly? It also sounds like a bad idea to deliberately push a PR strategy that draws attention to this phenomenon.\nThe more likely scenario, to my mind, is that someone came up with a new way to describe job dissatisfaction in a way that resonates, and media outlets picked up on it and repeated each other, writing articles about articles as they do.'"
