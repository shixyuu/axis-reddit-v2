        "In response to 'All credit cards make their cash off of drowning poor people in debt and killing what little chance they had to claw their way into the middle class. In the US the only higher cause of bankruptcy is medical debt (another ridiculous system designed to drown the poor). They also take a huge chunk of the middle class and ruin their future; forcing them and the next generation into poverty.\nAll credit cards are ran by scum, itâ€™s a purposely evil system.', a user said: 'Banks and credit companies make money 2 ways: grind it out of the poor and milk it off the rich. They literally make money by making the poor poorer and the rich richer.\nDon't have enough money? Here's a 'low-balance fee.'\nHave too much money for the size and skill of our bank? Here's a yearly bonus outside of your investment return as a 'dear God, please don't notice that our ROI is slightly lower than the place down the street and take our cut of your money away.''"
