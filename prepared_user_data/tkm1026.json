        "In response to 'Education would be so much better off in this county if we still allowed families to be supported by a single income. Imagine if most of your students had a parent with 40 hours more time available each week.', a user said: 'Had to explain this to my 11 year old sons just yesterday. They have a couple classmates with behavioral problems going on, bullying, false allegations of threats, everything is \"racist\". And my kids just weren't understanding how things like that could blatantly continue. \"Aren't they tired of being in trouble at home?\" Like, I'm sure they would be if their parents had enough time at home with them. But that's not what happens. Had to implore their patience and mindfulness of what they had that these kids didn't.'"
