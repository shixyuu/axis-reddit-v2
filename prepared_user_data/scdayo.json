He told me to stretch out my work day to be available for anyone wanting to contact me till at least 10 pm, while only filling out 9 hours in the daily timesheet. All this bullshit about going above and beyond should stop, and since I am selling hours of my lifetime to the company for a shit pay, I will not give any more hours than agreed upon for the shit pay just because a daydreaming lunatic asshole is asking me to do so.', a user said: 'Recently, I had a check in with my team lead related to my performance and he outlined that I log off early for the day as he sees me offline at 7 or 8 pm, and I told him that my work shift is from 9 am till 6 pm and guess what his response was.
