        "In response to 'Original Post: Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing. They just called it “mailing it in” and the movie Office Space is a commentary on this.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting isn’t even mailing it it though, it’s literally just working, fulfilling your contractual obligations and job duties. Not going above and beyond. Just like they don’t go above and beyond to take care of their employees. Nothing about this inherently implies mailing it in or not doing work well while you’re at work, during working hours, doing tasks that are part of your job and what you’re paid to do.'",
        "In response to 'In a classic false equivalency the media wants to turn not doing more than agreed with doing as little as is humanly possible.', a user said: 'Yep, while employers not only don’t to above and beyond for their employees, they often don’t even stop at doing the bare minimum of their terms of employment, they actively try to screw over and exploit workers in ways that violate contracts/agreements, and often times even the law.'"
