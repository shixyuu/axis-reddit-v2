        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I was pulled into a meeting with both co owners and was told how much I was improving and how impressed they were with me. They called me a part of the “family”. Then I was fired on the 4th of July. No reason given to me. Thanks for making my holiday a nightmare for the rest of my life.\nEdit: To add to that, it was one week after the meeting and 2 days before I would receive benefits. Yayyyy go corporate America!'"
