        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone in the process of “quiet quitting”? I’ve been at my job for 9 years. I work in a department where I get swamped daily and have been under staffed since covid. I’m burned the fuck out. I’ve asked management and HR for help to no avail. I dread every day I wake up knowing I have to go to work.\nI’ve tried to pare back my work load myself but my work ethic is too strong to just go in and dog it but now I’m to point where I don’t care. I make great money and the benefits are probably some of the best in the country but I’m not happy at all. I’ve looked at applying other places and have had call backs but I couldn’t pull the trigger and leave.\nI’ve heard of quiet quitting where you just go in and do the bare minimum. Knowing my employer they either won’t bat an eye or they will come to me and wonder why I’m not laying waste to any and all tasks like I used to which would be a mistake on their part as that would piss me off lol. Has anyone done quiet quitting or currently doing that?', a user said: 'I quiet quit last September. At first I thought it was just a phase but now nearly 6mo later I think this is my new normal.'",
        "In response to 'Are you now much happier? Any blow back from the decrease in your work output? I feel like since I’m always short staffed I could get away with doing this.', a user said: 'I won’t say I’m much happier but I definitely have less stress and rarely get a really bad case of the Sunday scaries. No blowback in fact I don’t think mgmt has even noticed. What I do is high quality I just don’t do a lot. I wfh so that makes it easier.'"
