        "In response to 'Its worth considering, however, that the population of said country would likely have far more trust in the medical system if it weren't so blatantly obvious that financial gain is the top priority of the entire system itself.\nNot at all excusing or condemning the behavior. From a very neutral standpoint on the matter, expecting people to put their faith into a healthcare system that is clearly disregarding the wellbeing of its patients in favor of profit is bound to have a very poor outcome.', a user said: 'My God don’t get me started on this.\nDoctors don’t even offer guidance that isn’t part of a pregenerated treatment plan.\nThey just diagnose, read from the prompts, give you a print that you could frankly just find on WebMD, and say good luck see you in 5’y weeks for follow up.\nAsking the doctor questions about outcomes and results is met with a lot of “just follow the instructions” with no education whatsoever to the patient.\nThis is true across all the providers I have seen except nurse practitioners. They honestly are the only providers that can have frank and honest conversations.\nI am so so so very disappointed with what medical service looks like in the US.\n“For profit care” is a contradiction in terms.'"
