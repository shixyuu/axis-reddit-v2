        "In response to 'No one can honestly look at this last campaign and say she has low charisma. She’s definitely got Obama level charisma but we all want to pretend “oh sexism and racism aren’t a thing anymore”. From her debate to her podcast interviews to her SNL appearance - her charisma is top notch. A lack of charisma is not why she lost, but her strong charisma is why she’ll be hard to beat in a primary for the president or California', a user said: 'She does not have Obama level charisma lmao…what are you smoking bruh'",
        "In response to 'On whether Harris should run in 2028: please do not rehabilitate her.\nThe campaign itself was ok, but let's be honest, she was a bad candidate. She got asked on the view whether she would have done anything differently than an 81 year old man with 32% approval, and she couldn't think of a single thing! Why not say Gaza, or that the cost of housing would be more of a priority or something\nHer 2019 primary was also a disaster. And in 49/50 states we lost ground. CA governor? Sure, why not. But please not president, she would lose by even more in 2028. Americans want outsiders, not the ultimate insider.', a user said: 'She also lost statewide in California multiple times…time to move on'",
        "In response to 'For real. Stop with the false hope that Biden is going to do anything to Israel except more weapons', a user said: '“You don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist” - Joe Biden just last night'",
        "In response to 'It feels like Biden has been quiet quitting for the better part of two years. I can’t remember what he’s done since the midterms. And if I can’t remember and I listen to every episode of this podcast, it’s no wonder half the electorate couldn’t remember either.', a user said: 'Well he helped arm and fund a genocide so'",
        "In response to 'On an unrelated note - favs and Lovett being quiet every time Tommy brings up Gaza is infuriating, even if the idea of Biden changing strategies now is ridiculous', a user said: 'Lovett has made clear very pro-Israel and a Zionist. Idk about Favreau.'",
        "In response to 'If Harris is serious about continuing her career, then she should absolutely run for Governor of California in 2026. She probably starts as a prohibitive favorite for one of the most powerful political jobs in the country. If she does well in the role, she could credibly take another shot at the White House in 2032 or 2036.\nIf she just chills out for a few years and tries to run again in 2028, I don’t see any way that she breaks through the field. Who would want to run the previous loser again when there will be a long list of new candidates to choose from?', a user said: 'She’s not breaking through even if she’s CA Gov…why do we insist on torturing ourselves? Are we masochists?'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: [Discussion] Pod Save America - \"Is Biden Quiet Quitting?\" (12/17/24) [External Link]: https://crooked.com/podcast/is-biden-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'I’ve never seen someone so thirsty for the presidential bid than Khanna over the last few weeks. He’s been on like 70 podcasts in the last two weeks lmao…all to come in 9th in Iowa.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: [Discussion] Pod Save America - \"Is Biden Quiet Quitting?\" (12/17/24) [External Link]: https://crooked.com/podcast/is-biden-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'Kamala has no shot at being President, period end of story. Truth hurts, but I wanna win next time.'",
        "In response to 'Harris running for President again would be nice in the sense that I could just check out early instead of getting my hopes and wasting money donating. This country simply will not elect a woman to be President, and as depressing as that is we can either be practical and do our best to win or learn nothing and just keep losing.', a user said: 'It’s more about her being a shite candidate than being a woman…'",
        "In response to 'Is the evidence of that all the previous women presidents this country has had?', a user said: 'I don’t think the US is more misogynistic than Pakistan, India, Peru, Mexico, Israel, Bangladesh, etc…there’s no proof of this.\nAlso, we’ve only had two women presidential nominees…pretty small sample size to make such sweeping claims about whether women can or cannot win a presidential election. We’ve already had a woman as Speaker, which is the most important role in federal government beyond President.\nCurious: did you also think a Black man couldn’t be elected President in like 2006?'"
