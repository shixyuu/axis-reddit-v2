        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: 'Guys, i have no choice to work. I'm mean,  diying in the street isn't a choice. \nSo, in my job I do the less i can, and try to get paid as much as possible.\nAnd, I dont give a fck at all.\nThis fucking sub is full of shamed people. Like if there is some rewards, or logic behind capitalism, like if they trust the fairy tale who say that If you work hard, you deserve a good wage or any bullshit like this.\nHard wake up: the people with the most prestigious jobs, or the best wages do barely NOTHING, and feels like their fate.'"
