        "In response to 'Original Post: MacDonald: 'Quiet quitting'? No, it's just work-to-rule — and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'key points:\nIf “quiet quitting” is a thing, so is “quiet firing.” For example, if doing only what you are paid to do is quiet quitting, then giving loyal employees raises that barely account for inflation is quiet firing.\nIf employers want workers to go above and beyond, they must do the same — which means paying more and being more flexible. If employers want workers to do the bare minimum, they have to make sure pay stays in line with inflation.'"
