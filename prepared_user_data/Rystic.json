        "In response to 'Original Post: How many of you have \"quiet quit\" and when did it start for you? I got to say for me I quiet quit my last job 5-6 years into it after realizing I didn't have a future with that company, but I never left because I was at least getting paid and now have a decent savings account because of it. I legit started my new job early this year and I've already quiet quitted. I hardly do the bare minimum since I gave them a whole summer of hard work and not a single fucking praise. Or even any kind of \"hey keep it up you've been doing an awesome job\". The moment I make a mistake I feel like it destroys everything i worked hard for so what's the point anymore? I'm just going to keep working enough so I don't get fired, but if I do I doubt I'll be upset over it. It also just seems the way 2023 has went if the economy and housing market continues to stay awful next year I can already see people quiet quitting for 2024 and it hasn't even started yet!', a user said: 'Software developer, got an Exceeds Expectations review after my first year, and my comp increase was less than my first-year comp increase at my entry-level job 12 years ago. No bonus, either. After that, they started coming at me with things like \"we want you to do research papers to make the company look good\" and I just didn't care.'",
