They’d rather extend a project and increase their shelf life in the company, instead of having a junior do all the work for them super quick.\nAlso, it’s a must to have good rapport with your seniors. They are the ones that will give your peer feedback. Feedbacks are just as BS as work. Work friendships are more important than the actual work to get a good feedback.\nSame goes for half decent managers. They are able to push back their higher ups effectively whenever needed.\nIf you get stuck with someone that’s way too ambitious, try to switch teams. If not possible, then time to switch companies.', a user said: 'My senior wants me to do the work real quick. He wants to show off that he is able to do multiple things, and thus making his juniors over work'",

Then I sit on friday/ saturday for 6-8 hours straight, do all the five six issues and call it a week', a user said: 'Woww'",
