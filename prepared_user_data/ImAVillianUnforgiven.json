[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/a7btgkkkgp5e1.png', a user said: 'That's not quiet firing. That's exploiting.'",
        "In response to 'I’m not sure why you would think that.  You can’t simply fire someone because they are marginally ineffective.  There are lots of places where the lack of available labor means that a fired employee might not be able to be replaced with a new employee in a reasonable period of time.  But that raises the question of why it would be OK to not at least pull your own weight?', a user said: 'Some weight more than others, particularly when they're laiden with money and have others pull weight they don't want to.  There are only two reasons to employ anyone. 1: You can't do the work by yourself, or 2: You don't want to do the work yourself.  So then that begs the question, how important is that work?  If it's that important, maybe it's just as important to compensate like it is.'",
        "In response to 'What if they are so ineffective that they never produce enough labor value to cover their share of payroll?  Why would you give a raise to someone before they produced enough value to cover the cost of the raise?', a user said: 'What the fuck are you talking about?  Every single person employed provides value, or else the employer would just do the work themselves.'"
