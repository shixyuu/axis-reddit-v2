[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/2w7qh0ipwcj91.png', a user said: 'My expectation is that he will do it, right before the election for maximum impact. It is within his capabilities and will vastly motivate people, it would be silly to do it now when they can't focus the message on voting. I don't expect more than 10k, even that is probably egregious to  Capital who has extracted untold wealth from generations of youth with the college debt scheme, but I think he'll do it anyway for his own political survivability in the short term... something politicians can often be depended on to do, at least successful ones.'",
        "In response to 'Especially not when he could do 10k just before the midterms, then cancel more debt before the next presidential election.\nWhich is still good and will help people, even if it's a bit scummy.', a user said: 'Yeah, I would bet on that. For sure... there's people that need it now, especially with payments resuming... But they'll still be happy if it happens before the midterms and the establishment knows it.'"
