        "In response to 'For most ppl when they say they are lying flat,  they don't literally mean doing nothing. Most of them still has a job that allows them to get by life,  they are just abandoning the societal expectations of climbing up the social classes or starting a family', a user said: 'Some China people have been pushed so hard by their parents, the college entrance exams are so competitive, then 996 work culture… to them the way many of us live is tang ping by their standard.'",
        "In response to 'Just found out a fresh grad will earn more than me.\nSame dept. Same pay grade. But higher on the scale.\nMy qualifications and experience are better and more relevant.\nMy negotiation skills are not', a user said: 'Most times negotiation won’t work. Look for another job first. Even if you want to negotiate, you can ask the current company to match the new offer.\nIf they adjust your pay without you having another offer, you may talk to your colleagues and they all want the same thing, whether or not they are good enough to secure a higher offer elsewhere. So it won’t happen. You have to have another offer as a bargaining chip and “proof” that you’re worth that much.'",
        "In response to 'never take your employer's counter offer. use that as a counter for the company you want to work at next.', a user said: 'That's why the current company will generally only match, not exceed. Like if this guy chooses to stay over an extra $50 or 100, do you really want to keep him?'"
