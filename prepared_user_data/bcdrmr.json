        "In response to 'I am not feeling burnt out personally, quite the opposite. I think that the company and org you work for just matters so much. If you have a 4 day work week, unlimited PTO, no KPIs, make your own hours, a product that sells itself, etc. It's such a load off. I'd honestly take 50-100k less pay for that type of stuff.\nI'm an AE who just shows up for my scheduled meetings and demos and makes about 20 cold calls a day and am seen as the \"hustle\" guy at my company. I'd go as far as to say it's impossible to get burnt out as an AE at my company. I'd try to find some sales orgs like that.', a user said: 'Any openings?'"
