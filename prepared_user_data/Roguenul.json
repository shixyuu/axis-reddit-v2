        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'Many companies aim to do the minimum necessary (eg minimum safety standards required by law, pay staff as little as they can get away with, product quality is minimum for the customers to avoid complaints). Is that not lying flat too, if the company were a person? Yet companies don't face stigma - they're applauded for being \"profit maximising\".\nThe double standards between human vs corporate in this aspect is startling.'"
