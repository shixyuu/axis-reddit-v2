        "In response to 'I think employers are having a hard time with the fact that younger generations now hitting their prime in the workforce have way less tolerance for current working conditions.\nThis isn't the 1950s anymore. Wages have stagnated for too long, the cost of living keeps going up, and I'm expected to work harder and faster to make your shareholders more $$$$ while I take a pay cut every year.\nI saw my parents struggle and get sh*t on for their loyalty and hard work. I know what to expect.\nSo yeah, no thanks. You're getting what you pay for.\nI dunno what the solution is, but I don't care. I value my time way more than I value the literal pittance thats provided.\nBetter start getting more TFWs Canadian businesses :p', a user said: 'That’s exactly it. I watched companies chew up my parents and spit them out. They worked hard but they didn’t have the education that enabled them to securely tell an employer where the boundaries of their employment relationship are. They made sure that I went into the workforce with better credentials so that I don’t have to be abused by employers to keep food on the table. No god damned way I’ll ever let an employer tarnish their sacrifices for me.'"
