        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Can't stand when people magically lose their phone or tell me it died after placing an order.  I do screenshot my call log and send it to door dash when disputes happen regarding my attempts to reach a customer.'",
        "In response to 'Fr this, it's like they chuck their phones off the roof after placing the orderðŸ˜‚\nI can't send photos in the dispute so I've stopped calling and only text because doordash logs the texts through the app', a user said: 'That's fair.  People not being ready to recieve an order they placed can wear on you. \"My phone doesn't recieve calls from unknown numbers.\" Oh? You thought someone you knew was delivering your food?\nI like late night so I don't deal with traffic but a porch light or this car is in my driveway would be super helpful. luckily most of my deliveries were waiting outside to grab them yesterday.'"
