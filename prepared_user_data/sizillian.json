        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'Even before we had kids, it was usually whoever got home first cooked dinner. That changed back and forth a lot over our years together. When my son was born, it added another level of exhaustion to our life and at the time, cooking had shifted back to me. I was burnt out.\nOver the winter my husband, who now has a direct role in scheduling jobs for the company (and consequently prefers to start working earlier) was often done a bit earlier than in the past on many weeknights. He has been cooking and planning a lot more lately. He’s a good cook! I think we both enjoy the shared duty of shopping/planning/cooking. We both feel less burnt out as well.'"
