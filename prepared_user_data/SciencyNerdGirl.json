        "In response to 'Holy moly is this ever the truth. I make close to what the couple in the OP makes - on my own - and trying to get on the property ladder is a nightmare. It isn't helped by family members who have owned their homes for at least 8 years chiming in with advice from what is essentially another world. Finally had my brother in law, today actually, sit with me and try to and set up at least a tour. Found a home listed early in the morning, for 300k, that was accepting tours. Called the agent and she basically gave us a \"uhh are you SURE you wanna make the trip? there are quite a few contracts already in and they're all well over asking...\" and so we wound up just not going with that one. BIL began to grok the situation at least. For a first time buyer the insane bubble pricing and the FOMO are bright red flags, I can't picture anyone buying in good conscience today.', a user said: 'Your last sentence is exactly what people were telling us in 2017 when we bought. Back then we paid $25k over asking (and appraisal) and had to waive inspection and appraisal contingency. We won the house over like a dozen other offers. People were calling us idiots and zaying that the buying frenzy would subside and we'd have buyers remorse. Well...6 years later and it's done nothing but get worse. This honestly seems to just be what buying a house is. Long gone are the days of a family viewing some houses and picking their favorite to buy. Competition is fierce. You need lots of cash and to take on risk. It sucks, but I don't think it will ever get better.'"
