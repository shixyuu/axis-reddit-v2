        "In response to 'It's definitely not uncommon for people to subconsciously or consciously \"check out\" of a relationship before actually doing so, especially if they've realised they're being abused.\nAll the best to you going forward OP.', a user said: 'This is so true. I remember knowing it was over long before it was— years even. But what I especially remember is how a huge fight over something so insignificant left me sitting next to a tree in 30 degree weather for 45 minutes because I couldn’t stand to be inside with him. And I remember knowing we wouldn’t make it through the year. That was in January; I finally left in September, with other attempts to leave before that. Checking out is easy to do, and as a defense mechanism I have to encourage it because I get it. But what’s more important is acknowledging that you’re checking out and realizing why, and how to move forward. I spent so much time checked out. Feels like I wasted a lot.'"
