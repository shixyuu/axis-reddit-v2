        "In response to 'I wonder how they can age us out when so many of them don’t want to work, and the boomers are all retiring. Won’t they need senior leaders?\nI have been in hospitality my entire career and it sucks - I am so over the expectation that I have to pick up the slack or help when we are short staffed; “duties as assigned” is the biggest boomer scam. Basically means working evenings and weekends the entire peak / tourist season with “lieu days if you work an 8 hour shift” and no other compensation.\nQuiet quitting for me means saying no, I will not work these extra hours for free. I will leave early on a Friday if I have to work extra hours, I will ensure I get MY TIME back.', a user said: 'when so many of them don’t want to work,\nYou don't really believe that do you? There isn't a significant difference between generations on that front. The corporate mouthpieces keep saying this, especially in regards to very low paying service jobs, but I just don't buy it.\nPeople don't want to work jobs for less than a living wage, and I can't blame them. What's the point if you can't even afford basics? I can't imagine looking at life realizing that unless something changes, and fast, I may not have the opportunity to own even a condo.\nDon't fall for the rhetoric. Fast food can no longer get people to fill positions at 8 bucks an hour, this is true,  but they want you to believe that it's just the youth being lazy.\nSilent Gen and boners said the same about us, it wasn't true then, it isn't true now.'"
