        "In response to 'Original Post: My cousin is SFPD and has the same take on the bikers. Are we basically just paying them 3/4 $billion a year to cry and quiet quit? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/uhdkr8xy39ld1.jpeg', a user said: 'I don’t know if you’ve noticed but nobody really does their job well anymore, everyone was screaming how they don’t want cops to interfere and now you have it quit bitching, nothings going forward anywhere anyway… besides these bikers are not the only source of danger on the road, the car drivers are doped up, stupid and impatient.  The bicycle riders and scooter riders are cocky as hell and act like no rules ever should be followed, walkers are trained to walk right in front of traffic.  This whole area is based on everyone doing what they want when they want.  Live with it'"
