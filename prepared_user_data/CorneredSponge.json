        "In response to 'Original Post: Corporate media condemns job hopping & quiet quitting as \"disloyalty\", meanwhile Wall Street rewarded tech firms firing thousands of workers instanteounsly because they \"ripped the band aid off\" [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/bh1yrn4p6fga1.jpg', a user said: 'The market rallied due to FOMC meetings, undervaluation, share buyback programs, and relative financial success in the face of current headwinds.\nYes, the reduction of labour expenses was a factor, but it wasnâ€™t as large a reason as others. Moreover, these tech companies still have significantly larger workforces than pre-COVID; they just overhired because nobody knew how the pandemic would turn out.\nAnd the fact of the matter is that those fires have severance packages significantly superior to median incomes and benefits.\nAs for employee dynamism- I always support that as well.'"
