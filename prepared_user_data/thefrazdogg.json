So, they are looking at maximizing their value by only doing work that accomplishes the most for their goal. It’s not quitting.\nYou know, I work in IT, and there is an intentional work style called SCRUM. The company supports it because it is much faster development for the highest value piece of work. Things that are considered low value work simply never get done, unless the higher value stuff stops coming in. But, it never does.\nNow apply that to any professional work like project management, finance, or anything really. Someone asks you to do something, you look at it, ask some question, assess the value off that work, and you don’t say no, you just set it aside for your higher value work.\nIt’s not not working, or quietly quitting. It’s called working smart. And that’s how people get ahead. It’s also how to live a life with intention, rather than drowning in administration and very low level meaningless work.'"
