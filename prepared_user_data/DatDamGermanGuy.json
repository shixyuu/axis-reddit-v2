        "In response to 'They can’t be serious, defending the time change.\nLOL \nLiterally, nobody wants that.\nAlso, it’s not practical for some states to observe it and other states not widely across the board as they suggest. Very strange argument. I know there’s a couple of examples right now, such as Arizona, but imagine the US were half the states observed the time change and half don’t. It makes no sense.', a user said: 'I want this. Where I live, if we didn’t fall back, it wouldn’t get light outside until after 8. Think what that would do to morning traffic and kids getting to school. If we stayed on standard time, it would get light before 5 in the morning, but sun would set closer to 8 pm.\nI am absolutely on board with the time change; so much for “nobody wants this”'"
