        "In response to 'Original Post: The Flipside of \"quiet quitting\" is quiet paying. Don't forget this. Somebody older I know asked me why young people are \"quiet quitting\" their jobs and not trying to work hard. I told them that quiet quitting is a bullshit term that describes doing what was outlined in your contract, and not more. He started to tell me how you need to hustle and do more than the minimum if you want to succeed. I told him that the difference compared to many years ago is that now hard work is not met with commensurate rewards or opportunities. Then I asked him the following question:\nIf it is culturally acceptable to push people to go above and beyond what is outlined in their contract, why does the company always only pays what was agreed upon? Why doesn't payroll ever go above and beyond what was agreed? Shouldn't it also be culturally acceptable to expect extra salary in this case? Aren't my company quiet paying me?\nHe had nothing to say and just looked uncomfortable. He didn't really agree but he has no good answer either.', a user said: 'I’m salaried. I worked overtime last month and usually I receive a performance bonus for it but this time I didn’t. Guess who’s not going to work overtime again. The company is trying to cut expenses so performance bonuses have been suspended and pay raises have been pushed back for a month.'",
        "In response to 'Cutting expenses, except for the CEO’s bonuses', a user said: 'I decided to look up the information and found out the CEO in 2021 made:\n$6,992,563 in total compensation. Of this total $873,078 was received as a salary, $1,012,286 was received as a bonus, $5,057,653 was awarded as stock and $49,546 came from other types of compensation.\nAlso last month top leadership decided to take away remote work which conveniently coincides with the budget cuts.'"
