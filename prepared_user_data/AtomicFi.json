        "In response to 'yep. i work in the food industry where you're cut when the work is done and the service is slow, so naturally i always work my ass off to just get home asap. boss saw this and asked if i wanted a little extra responsibility, i said no, then he said it'd pay more so i reluctantly agreed. i ask for details and he says he'll come back to be and get me something more concrete.\nsince then my work load has increased but when i asked about the details again, i was told they'd have to get back to me\nagain\nand that i was in fact not being paid any more than before. don't put in more effort than you have to, it'll never be worth it in the current culture', a user said: 'Stop putting in the effort and if he asks why you’ve stopped, tell him you’ll find out something more concrete later and carry the fuck on.'"
