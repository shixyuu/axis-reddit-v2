        "In response to 'As someone who gets off on efficiency though this is so sad to me. Not in a managerial sense, I could give a fuck about some corporations profit. But in food service I loved the feeling of having a great team that you just effortlessly vibe with in the kitchen, and kicking ass with them through a huge rush. There's a sense of comradery and it's just nice. I want a job where I can work hard without being taken advantage of by management or despised by my coworkers. That's fucking toxic and sad in my opinion. And to be clear it's not the workers in this situation that are responsible for the toxicity. It's managers who are hyper focused on short term gains as always. Which leads to them shooting themselves and their employees in the foot in the long run.', a user said: 'I get it.  I want the team to succeed, so I would get my prep done quickly and efficiently then help other people with theirs.  Did that lead to a raise? Nope, just means more and more jobs piled onto my station while still being expected to help others finish their prep.  Now they're coming down on labour so we all have to do the same work in less time, but pay hasn't changed so we're working harder for less money.  Everyone's burning out fast.'"
