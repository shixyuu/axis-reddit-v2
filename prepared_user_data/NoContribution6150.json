        "In response to 'when i first heard the term i thought it meant secretly looking for a new job then just ghosting your prior employer...', a user said: 'That's what I took it to mean too\nAnd it's totally a thing. I've hired at least 5 new employees in the last few months who accepted the job and then just didn't show up for their start date and never replied.\nThey accepted the terms then changed their mind and couldn't be bothered to tell me leaving me without staff I thought wanted the job.\nHow people think this is appropriate or support this is fucking baffling.\nThey should be ashamed of themselves. It's a sign of our fast food culture. It's happened to personal relationships via tinder and its now happening in professional relationships'"
