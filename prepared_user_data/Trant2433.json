        "In response to 'This is additional evidence that the people in charge are clueless and have no plan. What happens long term is that birth rates will be shit if people can't start in life. Latin America is tapped out for immigration (despite caravan propaganda, we have negative migration, people are going back to Mexico more than coming here).\nSo this whole system will need to take a massive haircut because we won't have enough people and the country will turn into a retirement home.', a user said: 'we have negative migration, people are going back to Mexico more than coming here).\nRidiculous. We briefly had negative migration from Mexico (which is just one country) but even that was just official numbers based on things like H2B visas. In reality, it was still positive when accounting for undocumented.\nMajority of immigrants in last decade  come from central America which is much poorer than Mexico, and now it's a free for all from literally the whole world including sub Saharan Africa and South Asia.'",
        "In response to 'There are millions of people who own a house and a newer car that are completely oblivious to what's going on out there. Many are shocked beyond belief when life happens and they find themselves looking at having to buy a house or a car.\nMany people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nA mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.', a user said: 'Many people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nMaybe you haven't been paying attention to car prices, but FYI they've gone the same way as homes.\nAs an anecdote, my friend was going to upgrade her Acura SUV last summer. A few years ago, we could have got a certified one with low milage for around $30k.\nNot only were certified just not available anywhere, but the only new ones in stock  were maxed out models with all the bells and whistles (many that we didn't want). After all the fees, taxes, dealer increases, etc, we were looking at $70k+.\nOf course they didn't even mention the price - just a lot of magic financing tricks to limit monthly payment with a loan of 7 years or more.\nRegardless, after\nalmost\nbeing convinced into signing the deal, we realized that just 3 years ago, we would have been joking about buying a\n$70k car\ne.g.\nIf I won the lottery, I'd go buy a Porsche 911 or high end Mercedes...\nBut we've been slowly conditioned to just accept this new clown world reality - where a decent \"middle class\" car is now $70k dollars, to be financed over a decade. And a junky, 1500 ft square townhome in some treeless,suburban hellhole with 3 hour commute and no yard is all you can expect to ever own, even if you earn top 10% and have worked your ass off for 20 years. If you're not top 10%, live with your parents or roommates in an apartment well into middle age.\nF*ck all this. American deal was always kind of bullshit - you work your days away with no real work-life balance, few vacations, 0 pension or safety net, but at least you get tons of consumer goods like a house with a yard, a big car, open roads and cheap gas, and lots of cheap food.\nWell now those rewards are all being scaled back, one by one, while we're still expected to slave away for big megacorps.\nNo thanks. I'm out, dawg.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I looked up the exact apartment now, and with the increases in their local minimum wage, it's basically the same price proportionally.\nThat apartment is likely rent controlled for the past 30 years. Even far out or once dangerous neighborhoods have exploded in price relative to average wages.'"
