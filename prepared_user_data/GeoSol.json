        "In response to 'combative different fretful scale advise frightening ruthless grandfather touch fine\nThis post was mass deleted and anonymized with\nRedact', a user said: 'Struggled in school to understand economics.\nWas quite eye opening when i finally understood that it is all based off the assumption of growth, and without growth everything implodes. So it started to make more sense that i was confused by a system that was so obviously flawed, i simply couldnt accept the absurdity of it.\nKind of a similar feeling to when you find out that not only is Santa not real, but the parents you trusted have been lying to you gleefully this whole time, and somehow that's supposed to be a good thing.'",
        "In response to 'Office work actually decreases productivity. Like, do you know how many hours I waste over the course of a week, listening to Luanne from accounting talk about her grandchildren and torn ciatica?\nAnd if I don't smile and nod, I'm \"cold\" and not a \"team player\"\nIt's just so obviously bullshit to anyone who has actually ever worked in an office setting.\nNothing about these cubicles increase productivity, the opposite is true.', a user said: 'An office \"team\" vs a fast food or restaurant service 'team\", is a nice comparison. One side actually needs to work as a team t o complete the job from moment to moment, while the other fills roles that completes the job over the course of the week or month.'"
