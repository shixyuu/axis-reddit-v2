        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'Sounds like you may be moving too quickly or doing too much at one time. When you’re in a mew place, your brain can only process so much information at a time. If you try to do a lot in a short period of time, you’re more likely to burn out entirely and find yourself exhausted and uninterested.\nThe most important thing when traveling, at least for me, is to narrow my itinerary to as few things as possible, and leave lots of room for free-time, wandering, exploration, or sleeping. I’ve found my trips have become MUCH more enriching and less overwhelming since I’ve adopted this approach!'"
