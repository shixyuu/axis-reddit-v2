        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Me male HL wife LL Have you reached that stage ? Quiet quitting not leaving because of kids or what not but just quitting on the idea of romance in your head letting go of the resentment for your own mental health  and accepting that she’s just a roommate now ? We had yet another talk yesterday about it which she acknowledged the situation made promises again and that night it was just heavy snoring, told her today that I’m disappointed that our discussion led to no improvement even after her promises she said but we both agreed to make efforts ( because yeah I turned LL4U after all this time) I told her it’s ok I don’t even want to talk about it, I’m not even pissed as usual , she’s snoring as I’m typing this next to me and i don’t even care i don’t want her anymore and the sad part is the idea of getting to this point used to scare me but now I just don’t care, I don’t even think I love her anymore just that I’m used to her.', a user said: 'Holy hell- are you me?  Everything you just said went down with me.  The only difference is the last time we had 'the talk' was 4 months back and nothing changed.  My mindset started to shift from frustrated to roommate after Valentine's day, and now I feel exactly like you do.\nIn a way, it's nice to know others are out there going through what I am.  In another way, I hate that others are going through it because nobody should be married and be this lonely.'",
