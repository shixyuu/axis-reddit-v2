Employees don't get paid enough to afford to live and have ever increasing pressure to output more and more to drive value and stock prices higher, but despite that end up further and further from a good quality of life. This doesn't seem surprising. I would argue you see similar trends all around the world.', a user said: 'Also quiet quitting is literally just “doing the bare minimum of your job as outlined”. It’s not even like.. intense slacking. It’s doing what they pay you to do.'",
        "In response to 'Interestingly, this the same problem were seeing in the US, and it's likely to be the same problem China will see in the coming decades.\nWhen the economy is booming and people are able to advance up the social/economic ladder, living more prosperous lives than their parents, they are more willing to be stressed over work, and to work hard/long hours.\nBut sooner or later countries reach a tipping point and the quality of life stops improving or even starts declining from previous generations, and more and more people dont feel inclined to work as hard or as long if they dont feel like theyre reaping the benefits anymore.\nIn other words, people are becoming increasingly burnt out and are therefore less willing to shift their work/life balance more heavily towards work unless they are seeing direct benefits from it.\nAlso worth noting that many Asian nations with rather extreme \"work ethics,\" such as Japan, have some of the highest suicide rates on the planet.', a user said: 'Also honestly isn’t quiet quitting just… doing your job but not going above and beyond?\nIf so, I think that’s understandable, both in Japan and in the US. Wages are not increasing in a way to motivate extra effort, so why should they expect to see that?'"
