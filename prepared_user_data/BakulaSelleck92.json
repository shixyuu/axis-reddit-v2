        "In response to 'if they are asked to work over 8 hours in a day, they are required to get paid overtime\nNope. I do wish it was on a day by day basis. That means I would have gotten overtime for all of the shifts I had to work late because the next person didn’t show up to the hotel on time for their shift.\nIf they\ngo over 40 hours during a work week\nthey will be paid overtime for any hours over 40 that they work. In actuality, what happens is they will send you home early as soon as they realize that you are about to hit 40 hours near the end of the week. That way you end up working an 8+ hour shift or two at the start of the week, and then a short shift later in the week so you stay under 40 hours. It’s absolute bullshit.', a user said: 'How you fight this is to be\nreally\nbehind on the day they have to send you home. Like make it really inconvenient for them to have to make you go home. Then say \"I'd be happy to stay and finish my shift\". Either you go home and they have to deal with the nightmare you created, or you stay and get overtime. Win-win.'",
        "In response to 'Do you really think it would be management dealing with the “nightmare” you created that you would need to stay to fix?', a user said: 'I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone who is in a department alone with their boss. If you're being made to stay late other nights, odds are you don't have coworkers to pick up the slack, but just a manager/boss.'"
