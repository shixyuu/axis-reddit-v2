        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Might be in the minority here with this opinion, but I don't think DD or any other delivery-gig services should even be asking / expecting us to deliver alcohol or tobacco in the first place. I've personally never encountered any issues when I've had to do such deliveries, but anxiously hold my breath every time nevertheless due to the potential for all manner of last-minute shenanigans.'",
        "In response to 'I avoid alcohol deliveries as much as possible. I will take them if itâ€™s super high paying but other than that Iâ€™d rather just not. I donâ€™t like the legal ramifications if I somehow accidentally take a fake Id or something.', a user said: 'Bingo. And DD makes it clear WE'LL suffer the complete set, up to their fullest extents, of applicable legal consequences and penalties for failing to catch + prevent any instances of minors trying to acquire prohibited substances.'"
