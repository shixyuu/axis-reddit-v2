'Rage applying' is the latest form of worker revenge | CBC Radio [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/rage-applying-1.6759642', a user said: 'Wow. So employers really hate an efficient labor market. First there is too many jobs and not enough workers so they complain about too much government aid even though the real reason is stagnant wages and people retiring instead of continuing to work.\nThen people decide promotions are plentiful or valuable enough so they just do their job and bosses call it “quiet quitting”.\nThen people keep leaving for better jobs and it gets labeled “rage applying”. Pathetic.\nIt’s a competitive labor market. Compete or die.'"
