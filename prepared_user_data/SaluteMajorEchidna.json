You are now expected to seek out extra work, help other groups, think of ways to improve processes or productivity and do\nsomething\nwhenever you have the littlest bit of downtime. And youâ€™re being evaluated on it!\nIt feels like they are trying to squeeze the maximum amount of work from each and every employee. Never mind that I just saved the company millions of dollars on the project I worked my behind off in OT completing. God forbid I have a free moment to catch my breath, reorganize my desk or actually leave the office for lunch!', a user said: 'If you did something great like that, it's time to shop another job. For more money. then when you have it, see if your current one will match the rate. If not, thank you. I enjoyed our time together (even if you didnt). It never hurts to be gracious. You may need them someday.\nOr, even better, they may need you to consult after they get bought out $$$$'",
