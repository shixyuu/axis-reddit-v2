        "In response to 'Lots of atta boy in the comment section here... sounds like you had a pretty comfortable work from home situation and you have mouths to feed.\nI hope your skillset and degrees allow you to find work and provide for your family during your transition time. I'm glad you were able to stick up for yourself and allowed the human emotion part of you to take the wheel and make a decision for you that you were already leaning towards. I'm sure it feels empowering.\nDont take this mixed bag of fuckup blessing for granted... it's a privilege to even be able to feel empowered enough to quit a job in todays economic system... let alone quit a work from home job.\nI'm not saying you made the wrong decision or the right one. Just pointing out that oftentimes letting rage take the wheel leads to irreversible consequences that ruin lives. Be careful with it and take these atta boy comments with a grain of salt.', a user said: 'Pretty sure from the original post that OP is absolutely aware of this.'"
