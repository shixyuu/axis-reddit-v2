        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting: why doing the bare minimum at work has gone global | Work & careers [External Link]: https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/06/quiet-quitting-why-doing-the-bare-minimum-at-work-has-gone-global', a user said: 'Is that not what everyone has been doing anyway for the past however many centuries?\nGranted, you get the odd weirdo here and there in a workplace who think working like Superman will get them far in their career (extremely unlikely!). But for every normal working person, they just do precisely what they're paid to do - no more, no less.\n...Well, aside from the odd slacker, who can't even be arsed to do what they're paid to do, whine/bitch/moan/drag their heels when they're told repeatedly to do what they're being paid to do, and then are surprised when they're fired.'"
