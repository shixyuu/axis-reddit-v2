        "In response to 'Original Post: ‘This has to stop’: A young man on TikTok says he and his wife make $120K/year — but can only afford this run-down house. Why Gen Z, millennials are using 'quiet quitting' to cope [External Link]: https://moneywise.com/real-estate/real-estate/young-man-quiet-quitting-cope', a user said: 'Did you know GenZ is actually ahead of millennials and GenX in terms of homeownership rate at the same age?\nSource\nEven mills have made great progress there, with 52% of them owning their home (~ 5% behind GenX).'",
        "In response to 'Oh course! They won the lottery with their graduation years. They are getting multiple, high paying offers. Millennials were lucky to get a McDonalds job with a four year degree for $8.50/hr and are still paying the price.', a user said: 'Hey, us Gen-Xers weren't much better off.  I was born in the 70s and barely started my career when the GFC happened.  That shit lasted 8 years!  I was laid off 4 times in 2 years from 08-10.'",
        "In response to 'Gen X is easy to forget about because the boomers themselves essentially forgot they had children to worry about', a user said: 'Lol they really did forget us, didn't they?  I'd leave my house on my bike in the summer at like 9am without even telling my mom where I was going.  I just had to be home by 5 for dinner.  We'd ride 30-40 miles a day, down highways, railroads, wherever.\nNo cell phones.  Not even pagers.  Just...\nfreedom\n.'",
        "In response to 'Dude Gen-x had it worse than ANY of these generations. I graduated in '94 right when NAFTA was passed and globalization was taking off, factories shutting down left and right. What good ones were left, were taken largely by boomers who were still in their prime working years.And by the time those boomers started retiring it was 2008 and the GFC.', a user said: 'Fellow ‘94er here. This is super true. I’m from post coal town in PA that\ntried\nto resurrect itself as industrial mfg. in the 70s and 80s. Then it all came crashing down with NAFTA and the rise of Asian mfg.'"
