        "In response to 'Original Post: Employee quiet quit... 4 years ago. What can be done? I have an employee that has been 6 years with the company, the first two years he was performing very well and had a salary increase 5 times (the maximum possible) within 2 years. After denying a promotion the employee almost immediately went on a month's sick leave and when he came back, he never discussed anything about career growth and performance. The employee is the most popular person in the team and is engaged with everyone on a personal level, but not on a work level any longer. The proactivity is completely gone and when assigned new tasks it can be meet with \"I dont think this is on my level\". All the managers are always given \"the cold hand\". Besides this, the employee has far the highest sick leave in the team. I thought the issues were outside of work but could never get a clear answer as the chemistry between us went to non-existent.\nEventually, I became a higher manager 2 years ago and a new manager took over and I dropped the responsibility. The new manager has pointed out all the work is bare minimum and the employee does not seem to be motivated and when discussing promotions and growth it is often met with \"I'm happy where I am\". In the last 4 years, there have not been any personal salary increases on top of the yearly for all employees.\nI recently found out through multiple non-managers that the reason for this behaviour is because of the denial of the promotion 4 years ago. After hearing the stories, I agree that I handled it very badly. We were suppose to have a meeting about the promotion before the employee went on a long holiday, but I cancelled it one minute beforehand with a Slack message saying there won't be a promotion and not giving any reason.\nI'm wondering what can be done at this stage? I want to solve this and not by a dismissal as there are very high employee rights in our country.', a user said: 'First of all, throw quiet quitting out of your vocabulary. You sound like an idiot. It blames the employee and takes no responsibility for how a leadership team with absolute power over his career mishandled a vulnerable situation as he was clearly motivated to skyrocket and be recognized. The energy he put in was not being matched and he has every right to be okay with where he’s at.\nSecond, why has no one talked with him about it then? Like “hey this was mishandled, I see a trend, is that something you want to go back to or have things just changed too much”?\nThird, if he’s meeting expectations then y’all can bugger off. You’re just mad you can’t exploit someone who was trying to be a rockstar and advance. So now that he knows he got a glass ceiling you still expect him to do more? Get real.\nHere’s what companies don’t seem to get. Even in employment at will states, you hold almost all the power. It’s disgusting. An employee can be fired at the drop of the dime with no documentation or legitimate performance review. You just pack an employee file, don’t disclose it, and say goodbye. Ya it’s hard to rehire and train people, but you’re not the employed person wondering if the company is going to make some bogus decision to terminate.\nSo if the average employee can be let go at any time, ya it makes a lot of sense to do just enough to stay off the radar. The only reason this guy is on radar is because he used to do more expecting more returned (that’s a social contrast we all have, and work is meant to be a very explicit one where the person who generates more value gets more value back), and now he’s opted for the regular strategy. So it stands out. I doubt he’s sincerely doing less than the majority of people. Y’all just have that potential in your minds that he’s holding back. Guess what - everyone is. You probably are too. You’re not going to simp for a company that will give you nothing in return but more work and stress. That’s stupid or crazy.\nYou do nothing. You let the person acclimate to their position and figure themselves out. Four years after that flop and none of the people responsible did anything to fix it? F them. This guy knows he’s only valued as much as he takes on more work and he’s right to respect himself.\nYou want to help? Start fresh. Pretend he’s new and discouraged. Take little wins to see him valued as a person and not a number. It’s not hard. The fact that managers are clueless and ask these questions is ridiculous. He’s a person first and employee second. He clearly has a strength in forming relationships so play to his strength, let him get to know you, and see what comes out in time. Don’t force it. Because he’s clearly intelligent and will block you sue to your status to a degree if you’re anything less than genuine, and he can and will sniff that out. Almost everyone can, given time. Maybe you’ll build enough rapport to help the guy.'"
