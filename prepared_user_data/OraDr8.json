        "In response to ''Quiet Quitting' is a catchy little slogan that's being sold in the media as if it's what the worker is choosing to call it.\n\"Rob is a millenial who has decided quiet quitting is how he will make time for his side hustle.\"\n\"Jane is worried that quiet quitting will hurt her career.\"\nCan you imagine if these said \"Rob needs to get paid for his time\"? No? Becsause media will never support that narrative.', a user said: 'It took me a while to understand (via these threads) what the term even meant. I thought at first it meant quietly looking for a new job and then giving your notice when you did. No fuss, no drama.\nWhen I realised it just meant literally doing your job, no extra, I was like... Huh? That's 'quietly working'. What a load of crap.'"
