        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: '💯agree with you. Last year I really made an effort to leave work right on time. I wasn’t staying just to finish work I could do the next day. I don’t stay to “chat” with coworkers talking about work because it’s not worth it, I just bounce and leave once my time is done. I think that simple thing for me has helped me tremendously because I’m putting myself first.'",
        "In response to 'I started doing this too!\nMy coworkers always want to go out and drink after which ultimately just becomes talking bullshit about coworkers. Since I’ve avoided this it’s been MILES better.', a user said: 'I’ve never been big on socializing with coworkers but I’m definitely not planning on doing any hangouts no matter how well I might get along with some of them. It’s not worth it. I personally wanna just be in, do my time and get out'"
