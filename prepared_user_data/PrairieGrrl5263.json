        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: '\"Quiet quitting\" seems to be management's term for meeting the job requirements but not \"going the extra mile.\" The pro-labor term for the same approach to a job is \"work-to-rule.\"\nI haven't been employed by someone else since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Self-employed for years, now semi-retired due to health issues.\nIf I'm selling my time and effort to someone and they aren't paying me what I'm worth, why wouldn't I make the choice to give them their money's worth and no more, saving my energy for myself and my family or for finding a buyer (employer) who is willing to pay  me what I'm worth? IOW, selling my AGame at B or C Game prices is a great deal for the buyer but bad business for the seller (me).'"
