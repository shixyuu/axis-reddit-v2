        "In response to 'The term \"quiet quitting\" isn't used consistently in the media . . . and teenagers are notorious for taking something out of context anyway . . .\nWhat \"quiet quitting\" (as I understand it) doesn't mean to do the minimum at your job, but rather not to overdo things . . . not to give yourself over to your work completely. Don't work overtime, don't stress about deadlines and obstacles you have no control over. Just do your job, within your 40 hours. If you are a teacher, that would mean no longer coming in early, staying late, working at home, spending your own money on the classroom . . .\nFor a student to \"quiet quit\" . . . if they were serious about it, it might mean not doing homework, or not pushing for that \"A\", just showing up and doing what you can during the school day.\nNot doing any work at all isn't quiet quitting, it's just quitting. And there's a lot more of that going around these days then there used to be . . . .', a user said: 'Exactly this. Quiet quitting just means you aren’t going to do work that you’re ere not hired to do or that is not in your job description. Basically what we are doing when we say we aren’t going to work outside of contract time or we are not chaperoning after school events for Jean passes. My first quiet quit was in 2017 when I stopped doing my retail manager’s job for her.\nThe students don’t understand the difference because you do not truly understand quiet quitting until you have been taken advantage of.\nStudents are hurting themselves when they refuse to do schoolwork. I totally get a student saying they already get it. In fact, if a student ever tells me “I can ace the test right now, I’m not doing work,” I would give them the ultimatum of possibly flunking the test or doing their work and notify their parents of their choice.'"
