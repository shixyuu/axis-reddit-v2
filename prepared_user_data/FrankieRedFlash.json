        "In response to 'Good for you all!  Canâ€™t parent volunteers comprise most of the chaperones with maybe one or two staff PAID to be there?', a user said: 'In the county where my kids go to school parent volunteers have to go through a vetting process and receive training before they are eligible.  Basically a weekend afternoon and a $55 fee for fingerprinting and background check.  The local union wanted it for student safety and it really killed parent participation.  There are like 3 parents that volunteer for everything out of guilt.  Where I teach it's a little better but not much.  Basically the PTA pays the background check fees and the training is pretend.'"
