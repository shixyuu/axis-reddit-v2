        "In response to 'without really doing anything but the bare minimum\nI mean, \"the bare minimum\" could also be rephrased as \"the assigned and listed duties for the role\", right? The idea that there's something wrong with \"only doing the bare minimum\" and then going home is part of the corporate propaganda now.', a user said: 'I've seen so many places where upper management expects IT to basically look for work. Because management isnt technical, so instead of them setti g priorities and projects and assigning them out, they expect SysAdmin 1 to figgure out every project and upgrade that should happen (without being kept in the loop on things like expected growth). And then present that work to management, who will then make you justify it all 5x over, before denying half the requests anyway.\nWhen i see people saying \"they do the bare minimum\" i see it as \"they dont go looking for extra work to put on thier own plates\".\nWhich i think is a fine way to be. The problems arise when you have one person on the team who hates his familybor something and spends all sorts of time looking for extra work, and makes the rest of the team look bad.'"
