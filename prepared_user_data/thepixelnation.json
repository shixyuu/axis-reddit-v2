        "In response to 'As a pathetic Spiderman fan I love the idea of reading the comics for X-Men but feel intimidated by just how batshit they seem and how many characters there are.\nAs a One Piece fan I already have hundreds of minor characters I'm keeping track of as it is', a user said: 'x-men can be tough to get into, and it's honestly important to keep a wiki open esp. for krakoa.\nI think the best way to get into x-men comics might be Morrison's New X-Men. It's modern so not as tough as reading some of the older \"Must-Read\" runs, and streamlined so you don't really have to deal with 10 other mutant books.\nThose older runs are definitely Must-Reads, but I think New X-Men is a great entry point for modern xmen.'"
