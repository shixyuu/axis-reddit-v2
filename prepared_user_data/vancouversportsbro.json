        "In response to 'My fav is HR recently told me that I don't get paid for \"over performance.\"\nOk then. No more over performing.', a user said: 'They do the same at my company. They make it impossible to reach the top ranking in the performance review. They tie revenue costs to our goals, yet we are developers and work on defects. How does that make sense? I gave up once I found that and also when they gave a 3 percent raise as the highest during a year they acquired another company. HR at these companies are a joke, no one respects them.'",
        "In response to 'Even with losing no people, my team has 1/3 of the productivity. It is absolutely wild.', a user said: 'Pretty sure it's the same on my team. People have just given up and so has lower management.'",
        "In response to 'This is a reminder to everyone who doesn't know, HR is not there for the employee.', a user said: 'They are the worst of the worst. It's an unspoken rule at my current job, avoid them like the plague. I can't wrap my head around someone working such a soulless job like that.'",
        "In response to 'Kevin O’Leary would want 25 hours of work in a day. Absolutely bewildering how entitled some CEOs are. Not sure in what type of world they live into. Government has also slipped into the “do more with less” and “we need to be more like the private sector”. It is bad everywhere.', a user said: 'Hes a poser. I laugh at everything he says on cnbc. He's a terrible investor and stock trader too. Pretty much the loud and brash guy with big opinions on everything which is why people listen to him.'"
