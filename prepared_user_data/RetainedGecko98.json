        "In response to 'Original Post: [Discussion] Pod Save America - \"Is Biden Quiet Quitting?\" (12/17/24) [External Link]: https://crooked.com/podcast/is-biden-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'If Harris is serious about continuing her career, then she should absolutely run for Governor of California in 2026. She probably starts as a prohibitive favorite for one of the most powerful political jobs in the country. If she does well in the role, she could credibly take another shot at the White House in 2032 or 2036.\nIf she just chills out for a few years and tries to run again in 2028, I donâ€™t see any way that she breaks through the field. Who would want to run the previous loser again when there will be a long list of new candidates to choose from?'"
