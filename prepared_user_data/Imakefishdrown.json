        "In response to 'Agree. They employ one person, they should get the efforts of one person, not one person doing the work of two or more.', a user said: 'I process 2-3x the hourly number of accounts at my work. Sometimes 4. And my reward has been extra scrutiny. I've had managers sit with me to see what I'm doing differently, if it can be taught to the others. They have asked me to put together training to see if I can make the others like me (obviously no pay increase). I have to explain how I got my numbers every day. And when I was working from home while really ill with COVID, my numbers dropped but remained above the required baseline. And I got questioned then, why were my numbers so low, how can I make it better. Etc. They knew I had COVID too. But they want to squeeze every drop they can get.\nOh and I had a manager inform me before he quit that they will never promote me because they can't lose my processing power. It's not worth it to be the best. The only compensation is more work.'"
