        "In response to 'The loss of 2 hours of my Monday alone adds noticeable stress to my life. It means that in order to get the grocery shopping done for the week I have to rush and still get to the store later when it is busier so that grocery shopping takes more time and mental energy.\nIt also means I then have to go straight from work to shopping to preparing dinner. No down time from 6 am when I wake up to 7 pm after dinner is eaten. Every Monday. When I was working remotely, I got an hour more sleep, got to do grocery shopping either over lunch or before everyone else was off work, got a little afternoon time before preparing meals.\nThat's just Monday.', a user said: 'Kinda crazy, I realized for pretty much my entire working life I’ve never had to commute more than maybe 20 minutes for a job, I can’t imagine dedicating 90 minutes to just traveling to work, then working 9/10/11 hours and traveling another 90 minutes just to get home. But for some people that’s their way of life.'"
