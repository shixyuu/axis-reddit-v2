        "In response to 'This is how I always felt too. I mentioned it in the post. I was always of the opinion that \"bruh, why would you quiet quit? Just find a better job where you feel more fulfilled and leave\".\nThe issue now is that I am sending out so many applications and going through SO much emotional energy investment doing interviews, filling out custom-tailored applications that are of high quality, and so forth - and I feel trapped at this job. I can't just quit without something lined up and I can't line something up that is LESS shitty overall than what I have', a user said: 'I wouldn't call not working your fingers to the bone quiet quitting. If you keep pushing hard like this you'll probably burn out eventually, and there doesn't appear to be any reward for it. You're not going to quit, you're going to keep doing your duties, you're just not going to go above and beyond all the time like you used it.\nIf you were planning to go from like 90% to 20% effort, in other words to a level they should fire you for but might not for whatever reason, that would be quiet quitting. But dropping effort down to an average/above average level instead of a crazy level doesn't indicate quiet quitting to me.\nJust something to think about.'"
