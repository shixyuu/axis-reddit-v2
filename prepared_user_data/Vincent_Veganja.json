        "In response to 'Yes. I know one of my friends who got quiet fired by a tech company. Out of the blue she was to attend an “important call” which was about her manager terminating her contract. Within 5 minutes, her accesses were revoked and she was placed on garden leave until her last day of work. No severance package. No questions allowed. It was really bizarre as she was the best performer in her team. Maybe the company just couldn’t afford good performers anymore and wants only mediocre employees.\nApparently this was in compliance with the labour laws in the country where she worked. It was mentioned in the law that “if employees are allowed to resign with notice, the same rule should apply to employers terminating their employees.”', a user said: 'That last part is such BS and they know it. An employer losing an employee is\nnothing\nlike an employee losing their job.'"
