        "In response to 'It’s simple, if you’re my employer and I’m doing something for you, you are going to pay me for it. If you are not paying me for it, I’m not doing it.\nThat is the entirety of our transaction. We have a contract that defines the boundaries of this transaction. If you want me to do more than what was contractually agreed upon, we need to renegotiate the contract and you will pay me accordingly.', a user said: 'One of the problems is when that contract has the phrase \"...and other duties as assigned.\" Bad management can really milk that line into a ridiculous workload.\nBut yeah you've really hit the nail on the head with your comment! I love that.'"
