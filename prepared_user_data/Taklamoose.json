One project increased revenue by 3% with the same production, but literally indefinitely. That’s a huge win when pulling in hundreds of millions.\nThey shit canned me in early Covid. And tried to hire me back lol. That was satisfying.\nI now make 2.5 times the amount but work 35 hour weeks instead of 45-55'"
