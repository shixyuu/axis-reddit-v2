        "In response to 'Just curious, are you able to make the other fifty minutes actually worthwhile for yourself?\nFor a long time, I thought this kind of job was the dream. Now I've been there for about a year, and it's a soul-sucking nightmare. My days get destroyed because I'll have something like 1 morning meeting and 1 afternoon meeting, and I end up just idling away the hours in between. I usually just surf Reddit or watch Netflix. Best case, I'll get in a workout or read.\nI'm quitting soon to go to an actual job, where they're going to pay me more money to do real work. I don't know if it's just because it's been years since I had to do actual work for multiple days in a row, but I'm weirdly looking forward to it.', a user said: 'What does your job entail? I write software for a living and work remotely. Sometimes I can get a bug or feature done hella quick but just stretch out time so I don't gotta pick up even more work. I just use the time to exercise, catch up on shows, run errands, or have lunch with some friends whose day offs are on weekdays.'"
