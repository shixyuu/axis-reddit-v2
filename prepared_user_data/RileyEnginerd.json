Think I’m going cheapest this year, can’t go anyway.', a user said: 'I do the math every year with premiums and out of pocket max comparisons, but since healthcare is so overpriced in the US it always boils down to this: Any real medical emergency is going to put me over my OOPM anyway, and once you add the premiums the cost of all the plans is within a couple grand a year. So I take the cheap plan, if I don't have a hospital visit I save $4k, if I do have a hospital visit I lose $2k. I figure I'm not in the hospital every year, so in the long run it's net positive.'",
