Start answering select requests with, \"Gosh, I'm sorry, I'd love to help, but my plate is already full [or substitute the preferred jargon of your workplace].\" Do this more frequently as time passes.', a user said: 'This and to be a “team player” offer to kindly swap out task A for task B.\nI have time to “sweep the floor” or “wash the windows”. I only have two feet and two hands.\nIs it more important that the floor is swept, or the windows washed? I want to help out, please let me know which would benefit the company most.\nBefore I used to say: Sure I’ll stay late and “wash the windows”.\nNow it is I’m “sweeping the floor” today until you tell me to stop doing that and start “washing the windows”.\nMake it clear that you can’t do both at the same time and if you want them done at the same time, you better hire more staff!'"
