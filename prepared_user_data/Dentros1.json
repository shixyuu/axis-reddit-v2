        "In response to 'Shit! I wish I had quoted that.', a user said: 'My bosses pulled this same shit with me, the plant manager, department supervisor, and HR.  They tried going full fucking SS intimidation tactics right away.\n\"Do you really like working here?\" \nAnd: \"We expected more from you upon your return.\" Me: \"Why?  Are there complaints of refusal of jobs?\" Shit like that.\nWhat it boiled down to was that I wasn't being written. Up, handy way of keeping my union rep out, they were trying to scare me into working more, because I was coming back from a fucking back injury, and they thought they could scare me into pushing myself regardless of risk of injury.  After basically shitting on my supposed bad work ethic, I asked, \"are there complaints about my weld quality?\"\nThe PM says \"well no, you are probably one of our top guys in terms of quality.\"\nI tell you what, it lit a fire under me alright, to slow down and take as much FMLA as I could to avoid more injury.  Fuckers.'"
