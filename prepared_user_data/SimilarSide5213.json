        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I just did my first solo trip and I found that I had days like that, too. I learned that it is worth it to me personally to spend a bit more on a nice hotel room where I can really relax and enjoy my rest time, so that I can build my energy back up to get back out there. So there was one day when the weather was bad and I had a blister and was cranky that I stayed in mostly, took a bath, napped, watched Netflix on my phone…At first I felt guilty too! But then people who love me reminded me that you’re still a human while you’re traveling and you still get to have feelings, needs, and limits. So I gave myself a day once, and a couple of evenings, to just rest and recover and it made the rest of my experience much better.'"
