        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'Yes I know what you mean. I once took an opened ended trip by myself for the first few days, met my GF in Denver and spent almost a week in Colorado and after dropping my GF off at the Denver Airport I continued on to the Black Hills, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota. I didn’t know when I would go home but 15 days in I was feeling tired so I decided to head towards home. So I kind of quit but I had already seen the main things I had set out to see. I also didn’t want to spend more money at the time.\nI have had other trips where I had to end it eventually because when you don’t have to go home where are you going to go? I am an explorer by nature and I like being on the move. But sometimes it is nice to stop somewhere and spend time in one hotel for a few days without having to drive. I also take many trips where I have to do laundry so timing that is important.'"
