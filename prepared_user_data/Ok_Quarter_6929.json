        "In response to 'Original Post: Analysis Shows 'Quiet Fleecing' of US Workers—Not 'Quiet Quitting'—Is the Real Problem | \"Workers are more productive than ever, but their pay hasn't kept pace while top 1% wages have skyrocketed,\" says the Economic Policy Institute. [External Link]: https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/09/09/analysis-shows-quiet-fleecing-us-workers-not-quiet-quitting-real-problem', a user said: 'When I was a teenager I totally believed in hard work and impressing the boss to move up. Got my first job at a local big box grocery store. Fired on third day of training after I showed up to work early and took a minute to buy a bottle of water to drink during my shift before clocking in.\nAt the end of my shift I was fired. The boss said \"This is your first job, isn't it?\" Then proceeded to tell me that if I'm on the job site, I should be working no matter what hours I'm scheduled for, and if I need water then I should have brought water from home. My parents of course supported her decision and it wasn't until many years later that they stopped bringing it up as an example of why I don't work hard enough to succeed.\nOur culture glorifies exploitation and shames the exploited.\nEdit: I guess I shouldn't say \"clock in\" because there was no clock. We had hours we were scheduled to work, so starting early was totally unpaid, not overtime.'"
