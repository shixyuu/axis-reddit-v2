I want to be known as the boss who proactively fights for raises for staff, treats people with respect, and helps them get promotions in other departments/companies if they want it.\nThat reputation helps me attract good staff, and buys me enough loyalty that people will take pride in their work.\nRefusing to promote someone to save a buck is going to cost you more in the long run.'"
