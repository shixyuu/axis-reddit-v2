        "In response to 'Another point is living expenses besides tuition. Some students need to take out loans to pay rent, transportation, and other expenses if they don’t get financial aid to cover them.\nTo give an example, at the university I went to, tuition is “only” $16,000 a year after fees, but renting a private bedroom in a shared house is another $18,000 a year. If you want a 1 bedroom apartment, that’ll set you back an extra $36,000 a year on top of tuition.\nGranted, not every university has housing costs this high, but rent and other non-tuition expenses can easily tack tens of thousands of dollars onto a student’s loan debt over the course of their studies. Especially if they have to take an unpaid internship to get their foot in the door.', a user said: 'I live in Boston. Room and board can easily run $18K/ year here for a shared apartment.'",
        "In response to 'I mean to some extent it used to matter if you went above and beyond. You truly could go from janitor to VP with a high school diploma and the companies would actually try to take care of their employees. Boomers love to wax poetic about those old days but don’t realize that companies are now faceless, soulless giants that don’t give a shit about employees the way they used to.', a user said: 'Not all boomers :) But most.'"
