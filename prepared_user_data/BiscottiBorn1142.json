        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I’ve most certainly quietly quit at this point.  I may have even loudly quit without formally doing so.  That said, my situation is different: was successful for multiple years as an AE in a few different SaaS businesses, made a mistake in joining a company, ran into some mental health troubles, took a leave to deal with them and was fired the day I got back from leave.  Then I compounded that mistake by going into staffing and I knew it wasn’t for me.  4 years in with a couple different agencies and I still know it isn’t for me.  I’m just not the 100-150 dials a day hammer looking for a nail kind of guy, but that’s what my boss wants.  No strategy, no research, no email or voicemail, just pound the same cell phone 8x per day hoping to trip over something.  It’s not my style.  I’m desperate to get back into sales but I’m seriously concerned that this little foray into staffing has hurt my chances. I’m also in the wrong side of 40.  Frankly I’m feeling like the mistakes of my past have doomed my future.'"
