        "In response to '“Quiet quitting” but you want to stay 5 more years in the hopes your stay outlives your bosses’ stay?\nI would think hard about that strategy and how it benefits you.\nThat said, it’s hard to frame it as a goals discussion if you have no intention of progressing. If you truly want to just outrun the clock and do very little for the next few years, maybe just talk about how you’re happy in your role and feel this is the right pace for you. Focus on how you’ve met your metrics. If pressed, say it isn’t the right time in your life to take on more. Short, sweet answers.', a user said: 'I'm quiet quitting. I was very focused on the \"extra\" which is the prescribed effort for promotion. Told there would be no promotion. Immediately shut down extra and focus on billable project work only. That is my job description. You want a presentation or proposal? Ask that guy over there, he's interested in learning \"extra.\"\nBut when you zoom out 100x I realized I was just finally saying \"no\" to assignments above my level or outside of my scope. \"No\" will be received as \"not a team player,\" but they are in the business of profit, not the business of my personal wellbeing.'"
