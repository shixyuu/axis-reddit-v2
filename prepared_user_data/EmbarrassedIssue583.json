        "In response to 'Original Post: My icing quiet quit ðŸ˜‚ I made some Xmas cookies and took them to moms. I made far too many and brought the rest home. They all survived except the trees. The icing came off in a sheet. Did my icing job just quiet quit? The other cookies are fine. Only the trees did this. All decorated the same day using the same batch of icing. Weird!', a user said: 'Could this be due to that particular green food coloring? I would think that would be the only possibility since you used the same batch of icing for all of the cookies. I'm assuming the cookies were all cut from the same batch of dough too.'"
