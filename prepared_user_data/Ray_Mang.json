You would think it would be a sure fire way to grab yourself hard working and loyal employees, and probably good press? I don’t know, I know it’s a different political climate in Japan but I’m surprised that hasn’t become a movement yet with the older generation retiring and the world becoming more connected.\nI’ve always thought Japan sounds like an absolute utopia besides their work culture. If it weren’t for that, it sounds like actual paradise.'"
