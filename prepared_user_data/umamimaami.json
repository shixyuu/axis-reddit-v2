        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'I, for one, am ready to practice quiet quitting at the cost of promotions / job security / whatever at this point.\nBut I think our work cultures (anywhere outside of Europe and North America really) don’t really support quiet quitting.\nOnce upon a time, the industrial revolution paid people a wage against their time. And everything over and above that was overtime.\nNowadays, there is a weird cultural expectation of “owning the work” without any of the benefits associated with “ownership”.\nA higher salary is not ownership - it’s just the market value of my time. Only equity is ownership.\nUntil then, pay me overtime!'"
