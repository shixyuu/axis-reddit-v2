        "In response to 'Because I do 10-20% more than my hours state.\nBy doing that, Iâ€™ve gotten promotions to get 4x my original salary very quickly.\nThis path is much easier if others do the bare minimum!', a user said: 'I dont do more hours.  I'm a machine technician working 4 on 4 off 12 hour day/night shift.  However I work to a higher standard than those around me, the reason for this is I'm lazy.  My coworkers are also lazy but where they prefer to drag a job out I will get it done as soon as I can to a good standard so I only have to do that job once, then I can go and do other stuff.  For example a job change I can do while following the set out procedures in about an hour, other people take 3 or 4 hours.  This has led to me getting a 20% pay rise in the last 2 years that my colleagues haven't gotten and further away from being made redundant if things go bad for the company and they need to lose the deadweight.'"
