EMPTY! I was like man, I can't believe it didn't overheat on the way over here. The guy said he could fill it for me and I was like, well, gotta have coolant in the engine.\nI walked out there as he began to \"fill it\" and he was just topping off the overflow tank. I was like hey man, there's a big difference between the cooling system being empty and the overflow tank not being topped off.\nHe didn't charge me.'",
