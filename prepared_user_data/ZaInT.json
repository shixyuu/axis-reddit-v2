I think they can legally hire someone to replace me now 9 months later.\n(Two people quit themselves after I told them about the \"raise\". We earn at least 30% more now, all of us have better employers and overall feel better mentally.\nThere is sooo much more to this, but it sums that corporation up in an adequate way. Also 2% per year in Sweden is the de-facto - not legal - standard pay increase so it was about the biggest fuck you they could've given me.)'"
