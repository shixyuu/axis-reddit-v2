        "In response to 'Exactly. If someone cant work, even for a day, keep the same pace as before. Make the company feel every person is important, and that they are getting away with the absolute minimum. Because if productivity stays the same even when someone isnt around that will become the new normal.\nI know it wont work everywhere, but if the company can be made to keep the personnel, or even hire more, that's good for all workers. Both by having less work and less unemployment, which should also lead to an increase in salaries...', a user said: 'I did this years ago. Another guy and I were tasked with various routine things around the power plant we were at. He got pulled for a temporary project elsewhere which was easier and paid better; I was stuck with our shit work. Sometimes, shit just didn't get finished. I was told that I needed to get it all done and I said they were lucky that I could even get more than half done. It's a two person set of jobs for a reason. It didn't hurt my case that it would've taken quite a while to get somebody in to replace me since it didn't pay that well, had shit benefits, and required drug tests, background checks, and credit checks to get badged. They made do with what I was willing and able to accomplish, and eventually I quit for actual benefits and double the money elsewhere. I've since nearly doubled the money again after leaving that job too. And no joke, every time I make more money, I'm (for the most part) sweating less. It's more technical, but not harder.'",
        "In response to 'Lol at that last bit. Traditional farmers sweat the most for the worse payout from their crops. While CEOs are paid not to sweat at all, except in golf courses ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'There's also much more inherent risk in traditional farming. Harvest is dependent on a ton of factors, many of which are out of a farmer's control. A CEO could be fired for things beyond their control, but they aren't seeing foreclosures or going hungry as a result.'"
