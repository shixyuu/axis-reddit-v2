I look back on it, and I think this is probably why I put up with terrible jobs for so long. Hell, when I got fired the one time, my mother had a nervous meltdown about how this meant I was going to leech off of her now that I was\nunemployed\n. I literally asked for nothing, but it didn't feel great'",
