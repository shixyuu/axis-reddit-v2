        "In response to 'Original Post: SPE quiet quitting I never thought quiet quitting could be so detrimental to an organization.\nMy spe went from being a superstar spe in the workgroup to nobody home. He was involved in a ton of projects and was well respected by probationary examiners.\nHis out of office teams status message used to be a mile long with many alternative POCs for his projects ... now its like \"off till monday, no phone/email access, contact any workgroup spe\".\nJunior examiner actions get zero feedback and are quickly signed.\nYet morale is high and smiles all around, right?', a user said: 'But is he in the office? If he’s not it may very well be why he’s not so smiley.\n/s'"
