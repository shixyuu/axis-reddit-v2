        "In response to 'Original Post: I think my remote team mate is quiet quitting And it's ticking me off. Need advice if I should say something?\nMy team is fully remote,  spread  across the US. Our individual and team metrics are tracked by the amount of tickets we process on a weekly basis. This is a FULL time job and I've found that a member of our team is only logging about 4 hours a day - if that! Meanwhile, the rest of the team is putting in 9 hr days just to keep up with the volume.  We've also had to log in and work the last two Saturdays just to clear the backlog.  If this person would just work a normal day,  it would lighten the load on each of us. Our manager hasn't seemed to notice that this  person's \"numbers\" are half of what the other team members are producing. Do I speak up or keep my trap shut,  silently seething all day?\n**Thank you everyone for your input! I'm not going to do my managers job for them,  if they don't care,  I won't care either.  I'll hit my targets and focus on my career advancement in 2025.', a user said: 'Attempting to micromanage your co-worker IS NOT going to get you a pay raise, an award or an assistant to the manager title. Have you tried sending a slack or a private teams message to your co-worker? Middle managers love to micromanage. Its what they live for. Its hard for me to believe that your manager isnt privy some sort of special accomodation or information that you arent when it comes to your co-worker.'",
