        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I relate to every single comment here I can’t reply to just one. Coming from mortgage sales in this market, I died inside and am struggling to bring myself back to life lately. Trying to figure out what to do next, but no more cold calls, following up on bullshit leads, never ending stress of not hitting quota, bringing work home 24/7 answering calls/emails at all hours of the day, etc. Mentally, I never would have anticipated the damage that would be brought on. I swear to god I could work 30-40 hours a week right now doing anything else and be happy.'"
