Just read this and I see the same thing...', a user said: 'Blind Items Revealed #20 - Reader Blind\nCrazy Days and Nights / by ent lawyer / Jul 3, 2024 at 1:32 PM\nMay 1, 2024\nThis local A lister seems to have blown her chance of working with the A+ + lister by revealing an interaction with an animal. People are surprised that she would make an admission about something like this. Truth is she was advised to do this by the advisor she is having a very public affair with to make her look tough. The advisor did this deliberately to torpedo her chances as he will also be working with the A++ lister and does not want her around. The local A lister has grown a bit obsessed with the advisor but unlike the local Alister, the advisor is not willing to leave his partner and considers this only as an affair.\nGov. Kristi Noem/Donald Trump/Dog/Corey Lewandowski'"
