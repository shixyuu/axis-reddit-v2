        "In response to 'Lmao at “quiet quitting” when you want to stay at this job for 5 more years. I swear people are getting dumber by the day due to social media.', a user said: 'Social media comment aside, you have only shown your own ignorance and lack of understanding of what 'quiet quitting' even is.\nTo put it simply, and yes it's a terrible term,  it  implies doing the minimum as stated in the job requirements.\nNo reason OP can't stay on for 5 or more years doing the job requirements. That's all a lot of people that aren't interested in promotions do anyways and are content with it.\nEdit: while I don't agree with the other poster's attitude in future replies, I worded the initial paragraph in this post in the wrong way. That is my fault and I apologize for the unnecessary dig.'",
        "In response to 'Sounds like a great idea! Quiet quit for 5 years and get no raises and lose 20% of your salary to inflation by year 5. I understand quiet quitting if it’s a “Run out the clock” situation, but not for 5 years. Also, fuck you, you ignorant loser.', a user said: 'It depends upon the industry. One can still get cost of living increases or even salary increases without a promotion. Even with 'meets'.\nAlso, OP said they wanted to keep the benefits, not make more money.\nThere's a big world out there beyond your small one.\nEdit: spelling'",
        "In response to 'I just love how pathetically smug and presumptuous you are. You’ve got life all figured out. Shouldn’t you be spraying foam insulation today?', a user said: 'Nah, today's a bare minimum day ;)'"
