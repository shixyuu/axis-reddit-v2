The other is appearing to be busy without accomplishing anything, as is typical in the corporate world, which isn't really a work ethic at all.', a user said: 'That's what I thought was the case for a long time now, people coming in ridiculously early and leaving ridiculously late all for the sake of appearances while getting very little in between and even having to sleep at work to catch up on their sleep deficit.\nLike all the performative bowing when apologising for yet another disaster and yet nothing ever seems to change, it's all been for show for a long time now, hasn't it?'",
