        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'About 40% of the people I worked with in Chase are doing it. The other 60% are either happy they are back at the office or quit.'"
