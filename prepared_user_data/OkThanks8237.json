One has told me about their side job, which they apparently work during our work hours, and when I have called them in a project they're at the post office, the doctors, the grocery store, etc\nAnother didn't get a project to me on time, and when I reached out to follow up, they said they had a sick kid they had to pick up from school...but they showed active on teams all day while accomplishing nothing.\nBoth of themare newer team members who not only have projects to work on, but should be learning the intricacies of our software systems in any spare time they have, and neither of them even know the basics.\nIrritating to be sure, but mentioning it to management opens the potential for a full RTO and I would lose my shit.', a user said: 'They could issue a RTO for everyone based on the shortcuts of a few.'"
