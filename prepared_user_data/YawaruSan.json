        "In response to 'Unless that’s the Schtick, but you both have to be in on the joke. Jeselnek can do it because you’re both in on the joke. Maher can’t because doesn’t think you’re smart enough to be in on it.', a user said: 'Even Bill Burr had that uppity comedian attitude when talking about heckling in a recent podcast, talking about the audience just being regular people that don’t understand the complexity of telling joke.

O you paragons of wit and wisdom, looking down on us working class that have actual jobs and can’t sit around for days on end trying to come up with stories and puns.\nMel Brooks did the best job defining a comedian:\nUnemployment lady: “Job?”\nComicus: “Stand-up Philosopher”\nUnemployment lady: “What?”\nComicus: “Stand-up Philosopher! I coalesce the vapor of human experience into viable and logical comprehension.”\nUnemployment lady: “Oh, a bullshit artist!”'"
