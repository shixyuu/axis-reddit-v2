        "In response to 'When I was looking for a job a few years back, a headhunter asked me why I worked for a company for 16 years.  He then told me that most “ideal” candidates don’t stay at jobs over 3 years and move around.', a user said: 'This is annoying. Anything outside of the expected norm is “concerning” to them. Have a gap for personal reasons? Red flag. Moved around too much to find fair pay and good conditions? Red flag. Didn’t move around because you liked it there? Red flag. Had a senior title, then decided to take a job with a lower title after because you liked that line of work more? Red flag. You’re not allowed to have your own preferences and agency, you need to fit a box that constantly shifts over the years.'"
