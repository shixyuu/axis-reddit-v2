        "In response to '\"Accounting Manager\" but I don't manage anyone', a user said: 'Fucking rad, you have hit the sweet spot if you are into an enormous hourly wage (dollars per hour worked)\nI do the same but with consulting projects. Every once in a while I get a tough one but it’s usually director/st manager level. Now I do mostly universal cog work. But doing your shit well and on time is something bosses enjoy.\nI like to work a solid 5-10 hours weekly after an initial period of intensive rebuilding of all processes involved, which is 2 months usually to get it dialed in. Then barely work and crush close. Occasionally a miracle, look I did these 100  bank tie outs for the auditors last night. Stay up late Thursday and dip out the entire Friday and golf while the kids are at school. Basking in the heroism of meeting the impossible deadline.\nThen eventually reveal my plop and upload recs and JE’s and glom on to some mega project where I don’t need to do those things for a while. Mega projects have more meetings though, location freedom is diminished.'"
