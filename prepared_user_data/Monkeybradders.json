        "In response to 'See this almost happened at a previous job, I was admin, but they wanted me to do admin and sales for no extra money. Then the manager told me if I didn't he would sack me. As I had just come back from maternity leave, I panicked and started doing it all, realised I couldn't, quickly found a new job and left. When I left, I found out they'd replaced me with 2 different people because they'd realised it was too much for 1 person to do. Company has gone bankrupt now, but I wish I'd known back then that I could have argued it, but I was so exhausted and scared I'd lose my job that I just got on with it. Regret it so much now, loved the admin part, was great fun! (And the redundancy payout 2 years later would have been handy!!)', a user said: 'We had a woman like this. They replaced her with 5 people!!'"
