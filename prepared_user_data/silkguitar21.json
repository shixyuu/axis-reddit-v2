        "In response to 'Drives me crazy! They don’t get half they get 1/3. If they break up, they split the entire thing. Why do they think Robyn gets paid twice? Why wasn’t his money split 4 ways with each household getting an equal share?  He had four families to support. If I were Meri and Janelle, I’d ask how it was possible for Robyn to pay her mortgage, buy her kids cars, pay for college, and buy all the crap in that house. It is insane.', a user said: 'This! I remember thinking when he broke it down for us that uhm, no, the other wives are being super nice to you guys to keep the peace. You and Robyn get a third, not a half! And I can’t believe Meri was ever going to go along with someone giving you acreage based on the amount of children you have. Here, you help pay the majority of the mortgage and I’ll give you 2 out of the 14 acres. Insane.'"
