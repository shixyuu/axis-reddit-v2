        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It's not quiet quitting. That's a terrible turn of phrase. It's doing what you're paid for and nothing else. Working to rule. Doing. Your. Job.\nThere's a saying in science. \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\"\nSame applies to working \"extraordinary work, requires extraordinary compensation\"\nYou pay base, you work base.'"
