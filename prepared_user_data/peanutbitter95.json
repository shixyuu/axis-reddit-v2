[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'I think most contracts nowadays have a “and whatever tasks needed” type of catch all, unfortunately. At my last job I was putting in 12-13 hr workdays to make up for turnover and be a “team player.” The higher I performed, the more extra tasks got dumped on my plate. I quiet quit when they refused to adjust my salary.\nI started only completing the absolutely crucial tasks and refusing to take on others’ work, stopped offering anybody help, taking an hour lunch every day as I was supposed to, and logging off right at 5pm. In the mornings I would reply “my working hours are 9-5” to anything I received as urgent after 5pm. Shit that didn’t get done, didn’t get done.\nThey ended up firing me because of “performance”, although I’ve never hit less than 103% of my official quota. I collected unemployment for a bit, and found a much better job. It worked out great.\nEdit: typo'"
