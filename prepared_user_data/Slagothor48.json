        "In response to 'To be fair, that Biden and this Biden are different people. That Biden was when Democrats really were just as shitty as Republicans, when he was against same sex marriage, and was more of a high tier politician than someone concerned about the legacy of his Presidency. Not excusing him, but he's changed a lot in the last twenty years.', a user said: 'Wtf? Democrats have moved so far right they're barely indistinguishable from republicans at this point. Even Obama admitted a decade ago that he was basically an 80's republican.'",
        "In response to 'lol Jesus man, that's just not true. Are there still a ton of corporatist Democrats? Absolutely. Did they move to the right? Absolutely not. Talking about Medicare-for-All or affordable college or gay marriage or trans rights or lessening drug penalties and prison population would have been absolutely scorned just twenty years ago. Now, those are very popular positions in the party. Have Republicans moved more to the right than Democrats have to the left? Of course.', a user said: 'The democrat it the white house wrote the crime bill, my guy. He also wrote into law that student loan debt is unforgivable in bankruptcy. Btw marijuana arrests are up 25% under Biden despite him promising reform. The democrats have absolutely moved right. When Obama tells me he's an 80s republican I'm going to believe him over you.'"
