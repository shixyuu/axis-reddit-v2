        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'Yeah, I've apparently been \"quiet quiting\" my entire working life. Although, I do go \"above and beyond\" when automating my tasks so I can work less, lol, but that's maybe 2 small projects per job.\nHere's the thing, if you're too good at your job, you're their first call, you always have to train, and you never see a dime. If you want a promotion, your best bet is to suck up and rat on your coworkers. I've never been promoted, I suck up and feign ignorance about coworker activities because they're so freaking funny, I don't want the shenanigans to end. But yeah, nobody has fallen for \"promotion out of hard work\" bs for decades.'"
