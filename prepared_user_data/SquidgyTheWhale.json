        "In response to 'just wondering why we need a cute term for it that blames the employees, rather than saying, \"the boss doesn't hire enough people\" or \"management under staffs\"?', a user said: 'I don't see where it blames the employees at all.  I've only seen it used in a context of workers pushing back against the \"quiet quitting\" term, like it means the worker saying, I'm not going to be doing any more than what we agreed unless you pay me more.  You seem to have a different interpretation from what I've seen.'",
        "In response to 'both of these terms were made up in like the last two weeks.\ndo you think it is from the labor movement, or from something else?  if it is from something else, my guess is it seeks to undermine the labor movement, using a cute term.\ni really want to encourage everyone on this sub to stop using terms the ownership class chooses for the labor movement.', a user said: 'I do really think that the term was only created as a grassroots reaction to the suddenly hyped term \"quiet quitting\", which is an alternate explanation as to why you're suddenly hearing both terms.  I have yet to see any indication that the ownership class is using the term at all.  Why would they, when the term admonishes workers not to go above and beyond their job description?  I have been wrong before, but your interpretation makes no sense to me.'"
