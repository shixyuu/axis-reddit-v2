        "In response to 'As someone who is 5 years into the industry, they are a bunch of psychos. I used to keep getting attacked because - \"You only do what you are given. You don't have initiative, you should go above and beyond and voluntarily take up more projects.\"\nBasically, here is the deal - they cannot reduce the salaries. Hence, they are firing people and overworking existing people, expecting them to do additional work. Ie, reduce a team of 10 to 6 and expect the same total team work for the same individual pay. Hence, they are asking us to \"go above and beyond\" and do other people's jobs.\nOh also, meanwhile, they can fire you at anytime with zero justification, and have the security clear out your desk within 10 minutes.', a user said: 'This right here never forget. If they can let you go and let you retire without giving you money to stay. Your replaceable wether it is true or not. The managements mind is set in stone. If they call you back do it for 10x as much premium contract. \"Consulting\"'",
        "In response to 'Yeah no Gen Z or Millennial is using this term.\nIt's more corporate bullshit to shift blame for their shitty businesses that are failing.', a user said: 'It's also not a new idea by a long shot. \"Doing the minimum required to not get fired, while avoiding negative attention\" is an idea that every worker will figure out at some point. It's popular at almost every organization. It's popular with Gen X, it's popular with Millennials, it's popular with Zoomers.\nIf you're really looking to curb it not treating employees like a consumable resource helps as lot. As does giving them a stake in the outcome of the company with things like stock bonuses for all employees, employee unions, or coop employee ownership.'"
