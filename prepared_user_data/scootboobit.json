        "In response to 'Sounds like that would be much more suited to me, I was shortlisted for an AM position but ultimately didn’t get it and landed an AE role instead. I’ll definitely look into transitioning in my current company or apply elsewhere. Thank you for bringing this to the top of my mind.', a user said: 'I enjoy AM. A lot of keeping the customer happy, babysitting trouble clients and in my role, chasing our support staff on critical tickets. But more farming than hunting, pressure for sales isn’t there and you build great relationships if you’re good at your job.\nWhen a customer is happy with the product and support, you get credit where it’s due and when they buy more, that’s a reflection of your work.\nAll in all, good times! Plus even though I have some 60 hour weeks, most are closer to 25. Peaks and troughs there I guess.'",
        "In response to 'Farming over hunting sounds a lot less stressful while still being meaningful work. What’s in it for you that makes those 60 hour weeks worth it? I’m assuming you get commission on upselling clients?', a user said: 'Our products are in the mining industry, when I’m on site it’s 12 hour days in the mine, training operators or calibrating our system. I enjoy mining, I also really believe in the product after mining for 15 years prior to sales.\nThose calibrations are hugely important for customer buy in, so it lays the ground work for a great relationship. Also at the end of the week I link up with the mines senior leadership team.'"
