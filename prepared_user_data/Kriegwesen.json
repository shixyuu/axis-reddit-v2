        "In response to 'I started my career in 2006, right before the last recession. Back then, it was “Just be glad you HAVE a job.” It didn’t matter if you were complaining about a legitimately abusive situation—just be glad.\nThen for like 5-10 years after, I saw dozens of coworkers get the old, “We’re giving you a promotion! You get a new title and more responsibility. Unfortunately, we can’t get you more money… yet.” They would string people along for a year or two, not paying them what the role was worth. Saving a lot of money stealing from employees.\nSo yeah, “quiet quitting” sounds an awful lot like corporate boot licking propaganda. Wage theft is the most common and proportionally largest form of theft. And I have seen zero repercussions over the last 16 years for any of it.\nAdvocate for yourself, take ALL your time off, job hop until you make what the role is worth and fuck em.', a user said: 'I spent years of my career as a software tech supervising teams of engineers making literally double my salary. When I finally graduated they somehow couldn't find the budget to pay me within even 10k of the people I was tasking.\nI'm at a different company now and making triple what I was then but honestly I'm doing maybe a quarter of the work, intentionally. Maybe it's quiet quitting or maybe I just got the lesson early in my career that hard work doesn't get you fuck all. I've gone from working 60 hours a week to maybe 10. I'm never going to be that sucker again.\nI was raised by blue collar parents who taught me that hard work was the key to success. Nope. Not even close. It's all bullshit\nHonestly, if I weren't a government subcontractor I'd probably try to dip my toe into the\nr/overemployed\nworld and see how many different positions I could half ass at once'"
