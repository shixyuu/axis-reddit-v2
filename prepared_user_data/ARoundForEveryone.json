        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting - How do I do it properly Been at J2 for 9 months. Reorg in March completely dismantled my team. Manager new what was happening and fled to a new team.\nWas assigned to a new team a couple of months ago. Have not had any work assigned in almost a month. I log on. Attend a couple of team meetings. And that is it. Asked my current (new) manager if there were opportunities to hop on other projects. They pretty much responded by telling me to enjoy the free time and that they would get back to me. A new manager for my team will be hired within the next month.\nI've applied for an internally posted role with no success. No response to application.\nAny thoughts on how to handle this situation. I literally am doing nothing and earning a paycheck. Am I wrong to continue logging in until I get let go?\nThought about taking PTO for a week. Thinking now that I should just save my PTO, log in, start my mouse jiggler, and go about my business.', a user said: 'What? Your manager is aware that you don't have much to do, and is OK with it, and you're wondering how to get away from that?\nRide it as long as possible. Keep J2, but spend your mental energy on J1 for now. If and when things change, reevaluate.\nDon't quit. Let them realize that you're either redundant or the manager sucks at delegation.'"
