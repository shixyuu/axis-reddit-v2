Do the bare minimum. e.g. Someone asks for directions? Just point them in any direction away from you and say \"that way\", just to get them away from you. This is what I imagine Quiet Quitting to be. Not the definition I'm seeing in the media.\nI thought 过日子 meant that, anyway. I can't find it in the dictionary, though.'"
