        "In response to 'The \"work ethic\" that didn't really exist? My observations living in Japan have been that there are two types of \"Japanese work ethic.\" One is the master craftsman who dedicates their life to their trade in pursuit of perfection, sometimes to a toxic level which more or less abandons their family responsibilities. The other is appearing to be busy without accomplishing anything, as is typical in the corporate world, which isn't really a work ethic at all.', a user said: 'A lot of my colleagues thinking that appearing busy and clocking overtime extra hour or two IS a super hard work. And they could stressed like crazy just because of that.\nIMO people here just need to see around more. What they have here is better compared to most of not all Asian countries. The working condition is bad only if you're coming from SEA countries and working in those small - medium-sized manufacturers.'"
