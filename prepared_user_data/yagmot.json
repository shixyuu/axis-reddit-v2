        "In response to 'Closing your laptop at 5 p.m. Doing only your assigned tasks. Spending more time with family. These are just some of the common examples used to define the latest workplace trend of \"quiet quitting.\"\nSome experts say it's a misnomer and should really be defined as carving out time to take care of yourself.\nI suspect a lot of us do this from time to time. Pick a slow week and just put in your 40 and turn work off in the evenings and weekends. Seems healthy to me.', a user said: 'From time to time?! Stop drinking the koolaid my friend. This should be the norm. Working over 40hrs/wk is called overtime, and it should be as rare for others as it is for me. If you\nwant\nto work more than that for the same pay, go right ahead. Maybe management will show their appreciation with a raise or a promotion, but not likely. You can still shine without working overtime and argue your case for those things.'"
