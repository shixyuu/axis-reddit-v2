        "In response to 'Original Post: How to Approach Annual Review After I Quiet Quit Almost a year ago, my boss pulled some power move BS and I made two changes as a result: I took work email off my phone and stopped working more than the expected hours. No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a \"good idea fairy\" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't.\nMy boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise.\nSo now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the \"extra\" stuff has fallen away.\nIt will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?\nFWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years. Thanks!!', a user said: 'Lmao at “quiet quitting” when you want to stay at this job for 5 more years. I swear people are getting dumber by the day due to social media.'",
        "In response to 'Seems like a valid strategy. Just do the bare minimum to remain at the job.', a user said: 'It’s certainly a valid strategy to have an unsuccessful life. You hit the nail on the head. You’re very smart.'",
        "In response to 'Are you self employed?', a user said: 'I love how smart you think you’re about to be.'",
        "In response to 'Social media comment aside, you have only shown your own ignorance and lack of understanding of what 'quiet quitting' even is.\nTo put it simply, and yes it's a terrible term,  it  implies doing the minimum as stated in the job requirements.\nNo reason OP can't stay on for 5 or more years doing the job requirements. That's all a lot of people that aren't interested in promotions do anyways and are content with it.\nEdit: while I don't agree with the other poster's attitude in future replies, I worded the initial paragraph in this post in the wrong way. That is my fault and I apologize for the unnecessary dig.', a user said: 'Sounds like a great idea! Quiet quit for 5 years and get no raises and lose 20% of your salary to inflation by year 5. I understand quiet quitting if it’s a “Run out the clock” situation, but not for 5 years. Also, fuck you, you ignorant loser.'",
        "In response to 'It depends upon the industry. One can still get cost of living increases or even salary increases without a promotion. Even with 'meets'.\nAlso, OP said they wanted to keep the benefits, not make more money.\nThere's a big world out there beyond your small one.\nEdit: spelling', a user said: 'I just love how pathetically smug and presumptuous you are. You’ve got life all figured out. Shouldn’t you be spraying foam insulation today?'"
