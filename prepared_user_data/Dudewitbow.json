        "In response to 'Idk how this would translate across various industries….\nWall Street isn’t going to give up 20% of its trading hours, doctors and dentists aren’t going to not open 3 days a week, and shops, restaurants, and grocery stores all need to be open daily.\nThis just boils down to like marketing firms and tech companies… unless something I’ve missed….? Article doesn’t break down any of this, and just randomly pivots to quiet quitting?\n61 companies self-selected to do this “trial”, but the results are far from conclusive as far as I can tell…', a user said: '4 days a week doesn't mean everyone at the company takes a break on the same day. Smaller groups of people take their 3rd day off on different days of the week. 4 days a week effevtively extends the open hours of the week if its a strictly 8 hour business to 10 hours (plus the break time/lunch). You just have effectively less people on a given day of the week.\nThe only time of course 4 day a week would heavily affect business is when you have a very very small workforce (e.g if you own a restaurant and it only has 2 people working and both have to be there)'"
