        "In response to 'Fr this, it's like they chuck their phones off the roof after placing the orderðŸ˜‚\nI can't send photos in the dispute so I've stopped calling and only text because doordash logs the texts through the app', a user said: 'I'll call but then say, \"Since I tried calling 3 times without response and haven't heard from you through text, I'm going to leave it X [or take it back if alcohol]. Sorry, I missed you!\" I'm pretty sure they log calls through the app as well, but it's good to have a record in text as well, similar to how if you talk to your property manager of your apartment or your boss, you follow up with an email of how you understand your conversation and if they don't respond with a correction, that usually stands up in court. Lol.'",
        "In response to 'Just curious, why didnâ€™t you call though? Itâ€™s always easier for me to call because people arenâ€™t always by their phones. 95% of the time people answer calls if they are slow with texting. I can understand the frustration of the customer in this situation. She contacted you right after the timer ran out so you..say tough shit and screenshot this to post on Reddit? Ok lol', a user said: 'Yeah, I always call twice in case the customer left the phone on DnD and has the option where two calls gets through. I do have relatively little sympathy for people who miss orders given that they have GPS tracking for us, updates as we approach, etc. But I've accidentally left my phone on silent before, gone to the bathroom when my Dasher was far away, and came out to one missed call because they got here way quicker than anticipated. But running out the 8-minute timer isn't that they had been paying close attention but set down the phone and glanced away...'"
