        "In response to 'Love this quiet-quitting bullshit. Like doing only the contractually obligated amount of work is somehow cheating the system. Am I being quiet-fired everytime my employer only pays me for as many hours as I worked?', a user said: 'I think of quiet quitting more as a mentality. No drive to promote or improve performance review. It’s not good and it’s more than just doing your job.\nIt’s like the guy who takes his lunch in the lunch room and won’t let anyone ask him questions. “Bob the computer system is about to crash what do we do?”  “I’m on my lunch and still have 15 mins”. Sure he is owed his lunch but is letting the system crash doing him any favors?  He’s the one who runs it and is going to have to fix it so not interrupting his free time is not only hurting the company but hurting him.  And now everyone thinks he’s kinda a jerk.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Companies Decide to Keep Four-Day Workweek After Finding It's Better | So-called \"quiet quitting\" could decrease if companies move to a four-day workweek, an ongoing UK study finds. [External Link]: https://gizmodo.com/four-day-workweek-remote-work-tech-jobs-1850139680', a user said: 'Honestly I’d rather just have 5x6 hour days.  With generous pto (vacation).\nI’m mentally checked out by 2:30 anyway.\nA long commute might change my mind but I feel like every Thursday would be busting your ass to clear your desk and Monday would be making up for being gone on Friday.\nMaybe after decades and Friday was just assumed to be the weekend but until that happens any customer facing job (external or internal customers) are going to assume you’re there on Friday and be leaving messages and sending emails.'"
