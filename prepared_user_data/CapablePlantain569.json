        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'My first year as a teacher/first year of grad school I worked my ass off, stayed after until 5, worked on school stuff on the weekends. I was so stressed that I gained weight and we were unable to conceive even though we had started trying almost a year before. The month I got out of school and relaxed I lost 10 pounds without trying and we finally conceived. The second year I was like “for 40k??” And I started going home at the end of the school day, not taking work home for the weekends. Just using my planning periods. I am one million times happier. “Quiet quitting” is the way to go unless your job is compensating your time AND the sacrifice of your health.'"
