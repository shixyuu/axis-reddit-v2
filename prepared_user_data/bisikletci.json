        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I think it's a good idea just to take it easy when you're done sight seeing and hang out at a local cafe/bar/pool/park/beach/hotel room or whatever. Traveling shouldn't be ticking sights off a list, you can just take in the atmosphere and enjoy being somewhere different. As for eating out, if you know you get sick of that you could try to book self catering accommodation for some of the trip, or bring takeout to your room. If those don't work for you either, and if you've done this three times, it suggests you're booking trips that are too long for you. But ultimately it's your trip and if you change your mind and want to go home early and can deal with the hassle and potential expense of rebooking tickets, go for it.'"
