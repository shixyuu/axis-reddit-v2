        "In response to 'Original Post: TIFU and ragequit my job [Update 5 may, 12:00pm: Yes my wife is talking to me again. No, the company has not yet been in contact. I'm leaving now to drop off all my company-owned assets and badge. Wish me luck.]\n[Update 1:20pm: Thank you all for your concern, and whoever messaged the Reddit Cares folks - I'm okay. I've been working with professionals to improve my mental health for several years. This is a definite regression, but without the help I've already had, it would have happened much sooner, and much more spectacularly self destructive.]\n[Last update 7:35pm: It's the end of the day, and I'm not exhausted. I'm not short-tempered and grumpy. I'm actually in a good mood for the first time in a while. Thanks, everyone who had kind words. I'll keep reading and replying. It's not like I've got anything better to do with my time.]\n(Happened yesterday, for the pedantic.)\nI was on a Zoom call, waiting to give a presentation that was scheduled for a 15 minute slot. Three hours of listening to the presentations queued before mine, and it comes down to five minutes. \"Okay, I'll just speed through this, as nothing has changed, so it should be an easy approval.\"\nFirst slide. Second bullet. I'm interrupted.\nBy one of the committee who clearly hasn't read the proposal. Or any of the\nthree months\nof back and forth on the specific wording or implementation details, justifications and prior approvals.\nI try to drill down to the specific objection, even find the email thread where I was given that specific wording, and they ask for clarification on what, exactly, I'm looking to get approved. [What would you say... You do here?.gif]\nBackground: I'm building a script to automate some internal reporting tasks currently done manually. To do that, the script needs an API key. To approve use of the key requires this security review, to be sure the script is communicating and storing all its data securely. This final presentation,\n83 days\nafter the initial application, should be a rubber stamp. All the items in the application have been documented, action items responded to, amended, and given the go-ahead. The last change was over a month ago.\nSo, what am I here to get approval for? I need the committee's approval on my plan, because the security group who controls access to the API requires it to grant me API access, so I can build the script. The application lays out my plan to secure the data the script reports on. (Sidebar: To get the script plan approved also requires a complete review of the entire infrastructure plan of the server instance the script was going to run on. No joke.)  What am I here for? Ultimately, so the guy that grants the keys can check the box next to my request. What's the key for? Script needs it. Script needs documentation, approval. Documentation done, I'm asking for approval.\nI just want to write some code.\nYou tell me to get approval, fine. Tell me who to ask, and what assurances they need. Fine. Ask your questions, and I'll answer them. FINE. Just let me finish writing my code.\nThen, after three hours of listening to you drone on about details that are completely irrelevant to the other applicants' presentations - including questioning their business case for even building the proposed service in the first place - and you squeeze me in the last five minutes - and then interrupt me and talk over me and talk down to me (Sound familiar, ladies? Totally get it.) all because\nyou\nclearly haven't done the homework?\nI snapped.\nI said things that were inappropriate, rude, immature, insulting, potentially actionable, shouting and cursing and I don't even know what else. [I'm out of order? You're out of order! The whole trial is out of order!.gif]\nBut I've been out the door on this job for weeks. I've had my resignation letter written for a month. All I was waiting for was an offer from one of the dozens of job applications I've sent out. I fully planned to finish this project, put in my two weeks, quietly send out some goodbye emails, and fade away. [Homer disappears into the bushes.gif]\nBut nah.\nSo I clicked \"leave meeting\", queued up a bunch of emails, then went to pick up my kids from school. I was running a few minutes late.\nCareer-limiting maneuver? Absolutely. Selfish, short-sighted, impulsive. I'm better than that. I'm disappointed in myself and embarrassed. I didn't sleep last night, and ever since the call, I can't stop shaking. My heart is still beating so fast it's like some long, drawn out panic attack. I feel sick to my stomach and I can't sit still. My wife's not talking to me yet.\nBest thing I've ever done for myself.\nTL;DR: I've been ready to quietly quit my job for weeks, but a three hour Zoom call pushed me over the edge.', a user said: 'As much as it matters to you, I can tell you that they don't give a shit about what you did and have already moved on. I quit my job of FIFTEEN YEARS at the end of January, as a developer. I was tired of all the shit there. Tired of my boss. Tired of it all. I couldn't take any more of it. COVID certainly helped me start looking, but I am very happy I never ragequit, even though I wanted to. I gave my notice. Gave them 4 weeks. Once I was gone, that was it. Nobody cares. My old boss hasn't reached out once to ask how things are. Other employees I worked with for a decade or more don't talk to me. Nobody gives a fuck. Me, on the other hand, I've never been happier. My new job is awesome. I'm finally treated like a person. Upper management is great. I love the development I do (company develops cannabis grow monitoring solutions), and finally feel like I'm making an actual difference in the world. Happy employees equal happy customers, but my old boss didn't understand that. I was depressed. I was angry. I couldn't take it anymore. Good for you for finally quitting, because it will make a difference to you even though nobody else at your old place gives a fuck.'",
        "In response to 'Other employees I worked with for a decade or more don't talk to me. Nobody gives a fuck.\nThis is so true. When you fantasize about leaving a horrible company, you can picture the hole you'll leave. Especially when you know you're doing the work of more than one person.\nThat's the thing about being underappreciated, though. No reason they should suddenly care once you leave.', a user said: 'I dreamt of the day I'd give my notice. I could see my boss falling to his knees saying, \"No, please don't go. What do we need to do to keep you?\", and me saying something to the effect of, \"You could pay me a million dollars and I wouldn't stay.\" They were really good dreams. Then I gave my notice. He was calm, cool, collected, and immediately thought about planning for my departure. Congratulated me on the new opportunity. Never once asked why. He just did what he wanted to do for his company. He did not care if his employees were unhappy.'"
