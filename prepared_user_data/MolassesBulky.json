        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'I suppose its up to an individual how they want progress their life, reach their potential and still achieve a balance in life. Not sure if it has anything to do with what others think. Maybe as kid you feel the pressure from parents and loved ones but not as an adult who is already working for a few years.\nHave to admire those who have done it well.'"
