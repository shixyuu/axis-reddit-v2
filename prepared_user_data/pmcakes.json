        "In response to 'You feel guilty because you feel you are not maximizing your time in the foreign country, but you should not be framing travel that way in my opinion. You also shouldn't push yourself to the point of burnout. What is your purpose for traveling?\nI love my do-nothing travel days. I spent an evening in my Tokyo hotel flipping through TV watching a sumo wrestling match and eating reheated grocery store food. In Rome I thought the weather was too stupid hot and took an afternoon just lounging in a shady, tree filled park. In Saigon I visited the same cafe three times because it was nice enough and I couldn't be bothered to try and experience something new. It was comforting to go to a familiar place and the barista gave me a big smile when she recognized me.\nThose experiences were just as if not more important and memorable to me than the main attractions I visited. Just try to have a good time according to what you like to do and take care of your needs.', a user said: 'I find myself often trying to enjoy life like a local and just chilling/hanging out. No pressure to hit up a huge checklist.'"
