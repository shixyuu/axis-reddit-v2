After 5 different meetings about how the \"business\" wont \"approve\" my promotion I gave up. I got moved to a new position months ago but I am still the same person in the same seat on paper. Working double the work load from before so I just stopped caring. Tickets are not fleshed out, QA work is a pass over and as a result \"the business\" is no longer getting their stuff on their deadlines because of sendbacks.\nNone of it comes back on me and so I keep on moving along.'"
