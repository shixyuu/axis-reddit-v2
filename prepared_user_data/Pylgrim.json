        "In response to 'It seems like you have a misunderstanding of what quiet quitting is.  It isn't that productivity is steady, it is instead that the minimum effort is put forth so as to skirt the line between being fired and holding onto your job.  Generally speaking you see a loss in productivity, not a maintaining of productivity.  For example, you are given a deadline of 4 weeks for a project.  In reality, you could complete it in 1 week by putting in extra hours, normally you'd complete it in 2 weeks without extra hours, but in a quiet quitting scenario you'd wait until the day it is due to finish, waiting the full 4 weeks.\nSo your initial assumption is based on a false premise.\nNow for the rest of your weird statements.\ninevitably trending towards record-breaking profits for the top 1% regardless of wider economic factors\nThe only way you can call profits record breaking is if you look at them in raw dollar value.  Which, if you are economically educated, makes absolutely no sense.  Profits are records nearly every year in a healthy company because inflation creeps up every year.  When you look at the profits of these companies in the way that every single economist and financial person does, you see a decrease in profitability.  Yes that company that sold 1 billion in goods made 100 million in profit last year, but they made 90 million on 800 million in sales the year.  It's a record profit!  But the percent of profit made was less.  As we look through the economy you see this more and more.\na laborer under a functioning capitalist society exchanges an agreed-upon quantity of labor for an agreed-upon wage\nThis isn't really true unless you are contractually obliged to such a thing.  For example, a cashier at a store will inevitably have downtime, so their labor isn't being utilized but they are being paid for a such a time.  Conversely a construction worker may agree upon a contract that they spend 1000 hours building something but due to an unforeseen issue or complication they end up spending 1200 hours instead.  They don't get to bill for additional hours unless you agree upon that first.  Labor is not a quantity to wage driven process.\nand a consistent degradation of the wage, purchasing power\nI'm not entirely sure what you think this means, but wages have trended up, not down.  Purchasing power has changed, not degraded as well.  The only way you can come to these conclusions is by using bad data points.  For example, the purchasing power of someone in 2023 would include things that someone in 2010 did not.  Streaming subscriptions, for example.  The problem with purchasing power charts is that it makes no distinction for how the costs of people have modified over time.  Someone in the 90's would be amazed at not just the fact that we carry a computer in our pocket that has access to the internet at speeds faster than they ever did, but that those devices cost over a thousand dollars a piece.  Similarly, wages can only been seen as degrading if you look at the same job over time.  The value of many types of labor goes down as advancements in technology go forward.  We do not bemoan the stagecoach driver being a job with no wage potential with the advent of the car.  But today we do that all the time with things like automated order taking reducing the number of people needed thus decreasing the wages required for such a position.  Likewise tools which a carpenter or plumber uses have increased productivity requiring us to need less and less of their labor.\nmaybe actually read a campaign platform or two\nUgh, probably your worst argument.  Campaign platforms are the most useless, generic items that a politician puts out.  They have very little bearing on what they actually end up doing.  For example, if we listened to the platforms of republicans, we'd see them in favor of small government and responsible budgets.  In reality, we see neither.  If we listened to democrats we'd hear about the need for data driven spending and responsible budgets.   In reality, we see neither.  There's a reason that the joke in the US goes \"How do you know when a politician is lying?  His lips are moving\".\nYou have competent politicians, you just refuse to give them power for some reason...\nThe problem here is that there is no such thing as a competent politician.  I would also imagine that the ones you think are competent wouldn't actually address any of the things you want them to.  You seem to understand that in a capitalist society there is widespread prosperity to be had, but then you want politicians to do what?  Enact the policies that you fled from?  That is a great way to squash that prosperity.\nSome part thoughts to ponder on before you reply.\nIn the US, generational wealth, isn't a thing.  70% of all wealth is lost by the second generation and\n90% is lost by the third\n.  The idea that someone being wealthy means that you family is set for life is a poor one.\nIf you look at IRS data, you see that someone in the bottom 25% of income almost always has moved out of that bracket within a decade.  We have very recently had a skewed system in which more young people stayed in college, many for more than the 4 years for a degree, skewing age based statistics about what age you should acquire wealth at.  Previous generations didn't attend college at nearly the numbers todays youth did meaning when you compare average wealth at 25 today versus 50 years ago, there will be a vast difference.\nA large summation of everything I've said can boil down to, you've been lied to using statistics to manipulate you.  But when you boil the data down into usable data, none of the things you hold dear are true.  You read the headline of a news article from someone who didn't understand the study conducted and believed them.  When in reality, the data shows a much much different picture.', a user said: 'I'm sorry but if you were given a 4 week deadline to begin with and an assigned salary, fulfilling your task in the alloted time is not \"quitting\" or any other ridiculous deprecating word. You are fulfilling your agreed part of the contract and are owed the agreed compensation, with no buts, ifs, or any reproaches of any kind, let alone reprisals.\nMoreover, unless you're the most disingenuous defender of ultra wealthy corporations, you will know and admit that doing your 4-week task in 2 weeks is not only going to attain no extra compensation but, more likely than not, the next time you're given that same task, you'll be given a 1-week deadline. Congratulations, you made your life and everybody else in your position's and for no gain.\nIf you ask and ask, you may be given a tiny raise that, addressing OP's actual point, may not even catch you up to inflation.'",
        "In response to 'I'm sorry but if you were given a 4 week deadline to begin with and an assigned salary, fulfilling your task in the alloted time is not \"quitting\" or any other ridiculous deprecating word.

Are you unable to read what I am writing and respond to what I am writing?  The term quiet quitting is doing the bare minimum to get by without being fired.  That's it.  If someone wants to push the project deadline to the last date, then fine.  But they shouldn't expect to get yearly raises, promotions, or anything else.\nMoreover, unless you're the most disingenuous defender of ultra wealthy corporations\nOh, a talking point.\nyou will know and admit that doing your 4-week task in 2 weeks is not only going to attain no extra compensation but, more likely than not, the next time you're given that same task, you'll be given a 1-week deadline.\nYou expect to be given additional compensation, outside of your assigned salary for doing good work?  Congratulations, you just described promotions and raises.', a user said: 'It seems like you are trying to make it sound like I am clamoring for these people to be fired or worse\nAh yeah because the sort of language that \"quiet quitting\" is constitutes in no way a statement of dismissal and expandability. If there was no ill intention in the term, it wouldn't need to exist: we'd simply talk about workers doing exactly what they\ncontractually and mutually agreed\nto be paid for. Imagine going to a shop, seeing that a carton of milk costs $3 and upon being given a single carton of milk when you hand the shopkeeper the three dollars going \"huh, only one carton? It's like you're quietly saying you don't want my patronage anymore!\"\nCongratulations, you just described promotions and raises.\nYes, this is exactly what I said. Now, checking your understanding: do promotions and raises come 100% guaranteed from doing extra work? Do they? C'mon, please tell me they do.'",
        "In response to 'is just appeal to emotion, hope that I (or some audience) will be intimidated\nIt's literally not that at all?  It's interesting that you find this emotional appeal.\nyou're not right that job descriptions should be lies, they should be truths\nWho's doing the emotional appeal now?\nwhat this means is, if you're doing the job description, that should not be considered any form of quitting; to consider it so is disingenuous in the hope that you'll take home slightly more profit as a manager or owner\nIt seems that you have ignored what I've said in favor of the argument you want me to have made.\na worker's output being in the bottom quartile or whatever of people's who are doing the described job is irrelevant; it's patently ridiculous that the goalposts could move to \"top 75%\" without either the job description being updated or the pay adjusted\nThe people who do the most work get rewarded with pay adjustments.  Why is that \"patently ridiculous\"?', a user said: 'The people who do the most work get rewarded with pay adjustments. Why is that \"patently ridiculous\"?\nFunny how you keep using this as an argument, even though you are fully incapable and unwilling to confirm the consistency of this outcome when pressed about it.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Huh? How am I making anything black and white? By asking a question I give you all the power to add as much nuance as you want in your answer.\nBut to address your criticism, the question paints a narrowly defined outcome because that's how it works the opposite way: You consistently fail to complete your assigned tasks in a timely manner?  You will be fired, period. But that consistency of outcome doesn't exist if you work extra, or does it?\nSince I imagine you will continue to refuse answering questions, I will do it and you will let me know if you disagree: No, there's no consistency of outcome. Working hard doesn't guarantee you anything, especially if the boss has made it into a competition where only the ones who kill themselves the most get a token raise while those who \"only\" do their contractual load get dismissed as being basically a \"quitter\".'"
