        "In response to 'I mean is it surprising? Employees don't get paid enough to afford to live and have ever increasing pressure to output more and more to drive value and stock prices higher, but despite that end up further and further from a good quality of life. This doesn't seem surprising. I would argue you see similar trends all around the world.', a user said: 'Hard agree.  Wages in a lot of professional sectors have been stagnant and eroded with inflation but are tasked with constantly producing productivity gains for the company that the company then profits from (either from reducing production costs or producing more volume for less cost).  Cost of living is so high in places like the US and Japan that fully employed people are living in their cars so they can afford to eat.  Is it quiet quitting or is it simply doing the job they are paid for without being compensated for the increase revenue/reduced operational costs to the company.  Meanwhile CEO pay is grossly increased and the employees can only hope that their job isnâ€™t outsourced to a place with cheaper costs.'"
