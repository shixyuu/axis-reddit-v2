        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'Depends on if you are salary or not.  If you are hourly then don’t answer the phone/emails.\nMy spouse is salary, he doesn’t have a off the clock time.  If he didn’t keep up on the emails he would never be able to finish them for the day.  It SUCKS but he gets paid very well.'"
