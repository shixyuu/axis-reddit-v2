Even if he corrects this. Do your job and only your job nothing else. Meet your goals there and be done.\nHe gave you a bad evaluation because he's trying to force you to be his mouthpiece and be ecstatic about a Policy no one likes basically forbidding you to have your own opinion if it's different than his. Not to mention his listening  in on what was  private conversation.\nAs someone else said , let everyone know that apparently you are only meeting expectations ,as your  boss informed you and you have to concentrate on your work , no extra curricular stuff that's not included in your job description.\nSit back and enjoy the show when your ah boss has to explain and don't bother ever doing extra work since you aren't appreciated.'"
