[External Link]: /r/AskReddit/comments/xwwzxk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_quiet_quitting_acting/', a user said: 'Not everybody wants to move up and run the place.  Some of us just want to put in their 40 hours and go home, and as long as I can pay my bills I don't need a promotion.  So i'm not putting in extra hours and doing extra tasks that aren't in my job description.  The favor some people are trying to gain from employers is for future promotions or perks.  I have no interest in those perks. I can turn down that stuff because I don't work for free. Clock in at 9 clock out at 4:59 having completed all my assigned work whistling as I skip out the door.  If they're going to pay me the bare minimum that they can get away with, this is the effort they get.'"
