        "In response to 'True. I feel like one of the most common complaints on this reddit is that someone was betrayed when they confided in a coworker or boss. I keep telling people, your work friends are NOT real friends. They're not your family, even if they repeatedly say \"We're like a family here!\"', a user said: 'A favorite phrase of mine from a former boss who has since retired.\n\"We're all a team here at company X. What HR forgot to mention was that we're the All-Star Team. We all come together for one heroic project, and then we go back to fighting each other immediately afterwards.\"'",
        "In response to 'I’m just saying there’s people who expect to be promoted every year or every few years without really doing anything to deserve it. And you’re right, they probably aren’t meant to be managers.\nAnd if you just want to continuously give people significant raises for staying in the same position without promoting them, eventually you get to a point where you look at your staffing and go, “hmm my junior staff accountant makes $130k but I can get a new hire for $75k. Why am I paying this?”', a user said: 'I’m just saying there’s people who expect to be promoted every year or every few years without really doing anything to deserve it.\nThis is because without being promoted you get \"merit raises\" of 1% or so that is actually a pay cut every year.  If companies would actually give real raises like they used to pre-1980, you wouldn't have nearly as many people demanding to be promoted quickly.'"
