I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'It's more like when I quiet quit my last job while job hunting.\nWhite collar jobs go based off of results. So I'd get my shit barely working, not over the top, but good enough to meet the requirements, in like 10 hours of work. Then I'd spend 30 hours on Reddit, interview prepping, bsing on Slack and a bunch of other stuff.'"
