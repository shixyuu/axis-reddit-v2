What is the standard for \"working\" vs \"working hard\" when you're already paid an hourly rate or salary?'",
        "In response to 'I’ll give an example. My daughter in law works for a medium sized convenient/gas station. They have two registers. Register 1 only has to be register and keep the coffee cups/fountain cups filled and counters wiped. Second register has to work the register, stock the drink cooler/beer cooler/frozen food freezer, clean both large restrooms and then do all inside and outside trash. They get paid the same. So since she’s register 2 she works harder than register 1. She used to put in her best work but since management won’t divvy up the work or pay her more, she has since started half assing her duties.', a user said: 'Okay, but this is very wrote and task oriented. Many jobs aren't as straightforward. It also sounds like a simple problem solved with a simple conversation, not simply changing work habits.'"
