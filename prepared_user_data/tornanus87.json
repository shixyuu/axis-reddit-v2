[External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: 'I am 35 and I used to believe in the work hard mantra. But I have come to learn that is bull shit. Employers will Fire you at the drop of a hat. I have left three Employers with out notice in the last year. The wages were ok 27-40 an hour. But the working conditions were extremely poor.\nI now make better money but the work conditions still suck. I honestly don't see the point of working anymore. I will not be able to live a comfortable life with out working at all like my dad did in retirement.'"
