        "In response to 'I live in rogers/bentonville  and you are absolutely correct about the way that walmart does their employees. Management is paid decent but employees are left unable to afford their bills.  Living in the area makes it hard to avoid them but anytime I'm out of the area I actively avoid walmarts at all cost.', a user said: 'Walmart is just horrible to people.  My mom worked there for years, and anytime they would settle a discrimination lawsuit (say equal pay for women employees) she would see a small pay bump and then suddenly hours started to decline.  Or long term employees getting hours cut to the point they get reduced to part time and lose their benefits.\nâ€‹\nI worked at one unloading trucks after high-school and somehow got in the cross-hairs of an asst manager and a dept manager when rumors started about them having an affair (I didn't start them, and it later turned out to be true as she was demoted and he was moved to a different store).  I remember even being written up by this manager and on my notes on the signed form put \"manager blames me for his affair being exposed\" because at that point, I just did not care, but because an HR rep handled the form and not him, it did get filed.'"
