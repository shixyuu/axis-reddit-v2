        "In response to 'Hamster wheel can’t turn if you’re not on it…great post 👍', a user said: 'Again, 💯!\nAdults (not children because they often really don't have a choice), often complain that they are helpless.  They have to comply for this or that reason. In their perception, these reasons are valid - perception is reality.\nHowever, the reality actually is that the more people stand up for what they believe in, and stop getting bullied into supporting what they don't, the faster and harder the WT corporation would crumble to its own peril. It's a sad case of people unwittingly breathing life into the monster they detest.'"
