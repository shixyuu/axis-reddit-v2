        "In response to 'Answer: You aren't misunderstanding it, you're just missing context.\nA fundamental goal of business is making the best product for the lowest cost. How to make a better product isn't always obvious, but cutting costs generally is. One of the most ubiquitous ways of doing that is to get employees to do more work for the same pay.\nQuiet Quitting is a term invented to describe the current trend of employees, especially customer service and office employees, who oppose or reject that pressure to go more work for free.\nThe reason this has gotten attention in the last couple years is that the job market has shifted away from favoring employers to one that favors employees. Because of this, employees don't feel as much pressure to provide the free labor that and businesses have built their profits on. Many businesses aren't adapting to this well and have spent considerable effort to vilify it.', a user said: 'To add to this, the way employers have been trying to put anyone with a pulse at the lower level, giving those who are known to give minimum productivity(because they are to old or slow to give any more) a pass and then asking those who lead more responsibilities has been pushing employees to do less.\nThere is a cower who has been doing so. First because the night shift has been giving so much issue that they are now just given the basic work instead of the at large work. This leaves all the work that tanks productivity to those on regular(dayshift) salary and the ones doing the easy work also get the night shift bonus. Also management is too stuckup to realise this is why the dayshift productivity has gone down so they keep asking for overtime and pushing the productivity goals to the day shift.'"
