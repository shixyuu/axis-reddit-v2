[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'The term totally doesn't fit. When I hear \"quiet quitting\", I think just not bothering to show up for work ever again, and not ever telling anyone  that you work with. Just because someone doesn't go above and beyond their job description doesn't mean they're not doing the job they're paid to do.  Does the employee receive additional compensation when they go above/beyond? No. If an employer has an issue with someone not meeting their expectations, then it needs to be addressed in a performance review. Quiet quitting isn't the correct term.'"
