[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0xvxv41m8axc1.png', a user said: 'Basically if you’re not willing to fight for and sacrifice everything, including your life, for a company that doesn’t give a shit about you then you’re quiet quitting. Regardless if you do great work or not, if it’s just the bare minimum and you’re not doing literally everything for the company, then you’re quiet quitting.'",
        "In response to 'Mm'kay, I guess I'm \"quiet quitting\" then. Because I give 100% while I'm there, but when it's time to go home I punch out and leave. If I never came back, they wouldn't spare a thought for me.', a user said: 'That’s how they view it. If you don’t bust your ass for them and go above your pay grade and responsibilities without expecting anything back then you’re quite quitting to them.'",

        "In response to 'They get what they give and they will be happy about it. The employers I mean.', a user said: 'Same, I just want my paycheck. I wouldn’t work without it.'",
        "In response to 'Go above and beyond, maybe you’ll get a 4% wage increase for the year instead of 3%! If someone moves or gets fired, you might even be able to apply for a promotion!', a user said: 'It’s best for your happiness to just slack off and do the bare minimum.'"
