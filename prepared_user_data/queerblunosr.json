        "In response to 'My kid is 5, it did not go well. It went fairly similarly to how the dog is going and has continued to go that way especially medically. There is some cultural issues, his family emigrated from another country and used medicine that fit their cultural customs growing up and as a result there's a lot of skepticism between their children and modern medicine. This does not jive well with a small child that has a lung medical condition and allergies. It is also a large part of why I am not ready to pursue divorce just yet. There have been multiple requests for another kid from him in which I have answered  in no uncertain terms absolutely not. I love my kid more than anything, but I am not willing to sacrifice what is left of me to go through another newborn or infant almost completely alone.', a user said: 'You wouldn’t even be alone through another infant/child - because you’d have your first kiddo also. Definitely don’t have another with this guy.'",
        "In response to 'Right, but it isn't my first kids responsibility to take care of any additional kid and I just do not have the emotional and mental fortitude to take on another potential child with the chance of asthma and allergies.', a user said: 'Oh no I didn’t think you meant that you’d have your first kiddo take care of new kiddo. I just meant you wouldn’t be alone with just new kiddo because you’d also be taking care of first kiddo. Sorry I wasn’t clear!'"
