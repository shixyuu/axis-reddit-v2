        "In response to 'Original Post: funny that quiet quitting is even a term... [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/7tpkh1cisgj91.jpg', a user said: 'I know the concept mostly from teaching, in which \"working to rule\"—that is, being in the classroom only for the hours actually required by contract, instead of multiple extra hours each day for preparing, grading, staffing after-school events, etc.—is treated as a pretty serious threat, almost on par with an actual strike.'",
        "In response to 'Interestingly, this isn't what I've always been told \"working to rule\" is. My understanding of working to rule is that it's a method of protest to reduce productivity to a crawl.\nFor example, when the official procedure for a specific part of a job says \"measure the object to ensure it's within tolerance\" after you've been doing the job a while you can probably eyeball it pretty accurately. Working to rule means you follow each and every rule to the letter. So each time you need to check you go get the ruler out and measure exactly. Don't forget that oh&s usually requires you keep a clean workbench, so make sure you put the ruler back in its appropriate place when you've finished using it that time, even if that's the other end of the workshop. See a spill on the way? Don't wait for someone else to clean it, someone could get hurt.  Follow proper oh&s and go get all the appropriate safety gear and make sure it's properly signed while you clean, then make sure you clean all the equipment exactly as the guidebooks state, then return all the gear to the proper places. Get back to your station and take the next piece of work. Need to measure another piece? Guess you're going to the other end of the shop to go get that ruler you stored properly last time, etc.\nI feel this is better termed \"working to contact\" or, my favourite, \"meeting all contractual expectations\". You want me to do more? No worries, time to start a new contract and negotiate new pay terms to represent the increased workload.', a user said: 'I think the terminology might vary from industry to industry. In teaching we use “work to rule” to mean “we’re going to be here only for the hours our contracts explicitly require; we’re not going to get here early to prepare and stay late to grade like we always do, and if you want ticket-sellers for sports events or chaperones for dances you’ll have to find somebody else.” This is treated as a threat almost as serious as an actual strike, which gives you an idea of how strongly the system relies on free extra labor from teachers.'",
        "In response to 'This, all this. We’ve become disconnected from our history. We could learn so much from the history of class conflict. The power of labor in the 30s, for just one example, is the reason we have social security, unemployment insurance, medicare, wealth taxes, Glass-Steagall (since repealed), FDIC, the SEC, bankruptcy reform, Fair Labor Standards Act, and so much more.\nhttps://livingnewdeal.org/what-was-the-new-deal/programs/\nWe can do this again. We can do even better.', a user said: 'Utah Phillips on the subject:\nThese old songs, these old stories - why tell them?  What do they mean?\nWhen I went to high school - that's about as far as I got - reading my U.S. History textbook, well, I got the history of the ruling class.  I got the history of the generals and the industrialists, and the presidents who didn't get caught.  How 'bout you?\nI got the history of the people who owned the wealth of the country, but none of the history of the people that created it, you know?  So when I went out to get my first job, I went out armed with somebody else's class background - they never gave me any tools to understand or to begin to control the condition of my labor, and that was deliberate, wasn't it?  Huh?  They didn't want me to know this, they didn't.  That's why this stuff isn't taught in the history books, cause we're not supposed to know it.  Understand that.\nNo, if I wanted a true history of where I came from, as a member of the working class, I had to go to my elders.  Many of them, their best working years before pensions or Social Security, gave their whole lives to the mines, to the wheat harvest, to the logging camps, to the railroad.  Got nothing for it, just fetched up on the skids living on short money, mostly drunk all the time.  But they led those extraordinary lives that can never be lived again, and in the living of them, they gave me a history that is more profound, more beautiful, more powerful, more passionate, and ultimately more useful than the best damn history book I ever read.\nAnd I've said so often before: the long memory is the most radical idea in America.'"
