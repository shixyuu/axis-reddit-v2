        "In response to 'As someone who is 5 years into the industry, they are a bunch of psychos. I used to keep getting attacked because - \"You only do what you are given. You don't have initiative, you should go above and beyond and voluntarily take up more projects.\"\nBasically, here is the deal - they cannot reduce the salaries. Hence, they are firing people and overworking existing people, expecting them to do additional work. Ie, reduce a team of 10 to 6 and expect the same total team work for the same individual pay. Hence, they are asking us to \"go above and beyond\" and do other people's jobs.\nOh also, meanwhile, they can fire you at anytime with zero justification, and have the security clear out your desk within 10 minutes.', a user said: 'I mean depends on what type of work you are doing but I have been working with someone who is Gen-Z lately on an integration project and their lack of initiative goes beyond just doing the bare minimum. I literally have to hand hold them through everything because they seem incapable of doing anything on their own unless it was laid out for them on a platter with instructions so detailed I might as well have done it myself.'"
