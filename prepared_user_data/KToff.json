        "In response to 'I think the terminology might vary from industry to industry. In teaching we use “work to rule” to mean “we’re going to be here only for the hours our contracts explicitly require; we’re not going to get here early to prepare and stay late to grade like we always do, and if you want ticket-sellers for sports events or chaperones for dances you’ll have to find somebody else.” This is treated as a threat almost as serious as an actual strike, which gives you an idea of how strongly the system relies on free extra labor from teachers.', a user said: 'No matter the industry, the difference between quiet quitting and work to rule is the internal attitude of the workers.\nWith work to rule, the workers generally care and are trying to put pressure on the employer to improve working conditions.\nQuiet quitting, the workers generally don't give a fuck anymore. They are going through the motions and doing what is required but they are in no way or shape attached to their job.\nBoth scenarios can be driven by working time requirements, as with teachers, but it doesn't have to be. Quiet quitting can also be the result of micromanagement. Not less hours, but you don't even pay any extra attention to catch mistakes of others because you don't care.\nQuiet quitting is much worse for employers because the workers have disengaged. Threaten a write up? Don't give a fuck. Close your unit and transfer the somewhere else? Don't give a fuck.\nBut quiet quitting in my ears doesn't blame the worker. It's very similar to a high turnover. Says more about the employer than about the employees'"
