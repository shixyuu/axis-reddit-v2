Immediately they emailed the team declaring that full time WFH was over and we would be reporting to the office two days a week minimum; no discussion.\nOur team lead quit right away. I threatened to quit as well - until an old soup called me dangling a promise of a promotion if I stayed; reluctantly, I elected to stay.\nSurprise, surprise. No promotion came.\nThese people don’t fucking care about us. We’re little more than pawns in their game.'"
