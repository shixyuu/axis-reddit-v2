I’m doing it and IDGAF. I’ve busted my ass for my company and have brought over $100m into the company from one project alone. Yet I got a 2% raise this year and a 3% raise the year before, all while said company is on track for $20 billion in PROFIT this year alone.\nI’ve put myself out there and you spit on me. I’ll never do more than the bare minimum for you again. If you don’t like it then offer me a severance package and I’ll show myself out.'",

I know my value, so pay me and respect me otherwise you can fuck off and I’ll do something else with my talents.\nI’ve never been less scared of what would happen if I lose my job.\nThe irony is that if you would have thrown me/ us a bone prior to the pandemic I likely wouldn’t have made so many life changes and I’d still be vulnerable. You assholes pushed too hard and got too greedy.'"
