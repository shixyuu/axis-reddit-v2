Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'I always call right before checkout if I need substitution consult. Once this lady sent me an angry text once I was en route because I apparently don't wait for a response, despite sending her several messages over a 20 minute period and by the time she messaged me, it had been 30 minutes since the first message.'"
