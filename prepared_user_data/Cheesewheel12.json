        "In response to 'Original Post: [Discussion] Pod Save America - \"Is Biden Quiet Quitting?\" (12/17/24) [External Link]: https://crooked.com/podcast/is-biden-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'There must be a better way to platform dems than this. The Ro Khanna interview was incredibly boring and lethargic. They all are. If the thesis is that this brings the politicians’ name ID and donations it\ncannot possibly\nbe supported by the data.\nMaybe they need like 2 or 3 on at a time? Not to debate but to really commit to Favs’ brainstorming sessions?'",
        "In response to 'I’ll be honest even when I was religiously listening to the pods I skipped 90% of the interviews they did with politicians because they were total softballs where nothing interesting was discussed and no news was ever broken.', a user said: 'They’re all the same. “I’m just like you, listener! My dad was a plumber teacher steelworker nurse and I once had a loan!” Nobody is challenged, much is proposed but there is no follow through, the successes they tout in district A never manage to make it to district B - it’s exhausting. What a waste of everyone’s time.'"
