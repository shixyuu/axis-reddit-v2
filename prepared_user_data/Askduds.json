        "In response to 'The term is a misnomer started in a TikTok video that went viral and was picked up by the media. It is actually a concept called Work to Rule which is the concept that you just do the bare minimum for what you are paid to do and do not go above and beyond. In the US, though, work culture has been formed to expect employees to go \"above and beyond\" and we as workers have been conditioned to grind and do the most. People are discovering that all that hard work and sacrifice is only getting us more work and no more pay. Now that people are just doing what they are paid to do, corporations and businesses are panicking because they are losing productivity and the free labor they are used to having. We are all saying, no. We aren't working for free anymore.', a user said: 'Yeah it not about 40 hours, it’s about refusing to do the little extra things we all do that aren’t directly our jobs.\nIt’s about refusing to help the office manager unpack a supermarket order, or pick up a pen for Greg when you visit the stationary cupboard or helping someone outside your team with a problem.'"
