        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'I love where you're coming from, but I disagree. Working to rule is a protest tactic. Doing your job should not be seen as a protest, but as the norm. Call it Doing Your Job.'",
        "In response to 'There is no difference between working to rule and \"quiet quitting.\" Their definitions are identical.\nYou are correct, working to rule was and is a protest tactic. It is being used as one now in response to low wages and employees being treated like garbage, but it is being framed as a negative with a new phrase. They are the same with one spin benefiting the worker and one to make workers look lazy.', a user said: 'I’m honestly confused. In the post you say “doing more than you’re hired for needs to stop.” Do you mean it needs to stop until demands are met/conditions improve, but after that it’s appropriate? Or do you mean it just isn’t right?'"
