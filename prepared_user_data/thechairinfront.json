        "In response to 'Iâ€™m right there with you. Mentally, the Covid quarantine was a game changer for me.\nLike a lot of people, I spent the quarantine working from home. By home, I meant I left my apartment in the city and moved 600 miles away to be closer to family.\nOnce Covid was over, there was no way I was going back. So, I quit and started working for another company. That company was quickly bought out, and a year later they still donâ€™t have a plan for how they will move forward. So for the last 16 months Iâ€™ve been working from home, maybe 20 minutes a day, for a six figure salary.\nIâ€™m feeling the same supply chain/lead time issues as you, so every time I talk to a client I feel like I will only disappoint them by not being able to get them what they need when they need it.\nLike you, I really donâ€™t care if I lose this job. If that happened today I would not even look for another job until 2023. I would spend the rest of the year figuring out what I wanted to do next, because Iâ€™d want it to be completely different than what I do now. Iâ€™m almost debt free, so Iâ€™ll probably make that change soon anyway.', a user said: 'Well, if your company decides to hire for your job let me know. I can handle 20 minutes of work for a six figure salary for a while. ðŸ‘Œ'"
