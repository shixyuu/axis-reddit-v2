        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is people realizing there is more to life than work. The powers that be are pissed because now they can't get as much work out their workers and need to hire more so they try to call it something negative.\nQuiet quitting or stay and quit used to be a term used for those employees who stayed in a job and do the absolute bare minimum to keep their job. They would just toe the line of getting fired.\nWhat a bunch of bullshit to use this term for productive employees who don't want to take on 1 and half jobs and work 55 to 60 hours a week.', a user said: '…with no direct compensation. It’s straight bullshit.'",
        "In response to 'Great fucking point.  I mean great.  You need awards from anyone on this thread, including me.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, my question is why this hadn’t happened sooner?  Why skip over Mexico and leap over a great ocean before investing in North America?', a user said: 'Because China is a gold mine, not just for cheap labor but for consumers.\nCompanies are literally giving away their secrets for an opportunity to sell there.'"
