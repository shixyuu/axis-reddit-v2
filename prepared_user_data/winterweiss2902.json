J1 CEO just raved to us last week about how profitable business is but in the next breath said we’re in a hiring and promotion freeze until 2024.', a user said: 'Profit means revenue less cost. To keep profits high while revenue is not getting anywhere… their only way is to cut.'",

Now Companies Are Quiet Cutting Layoffs are down, but employers are still finding ways to cut jobs -  Is this normal or economy tanking? More problems expected in late 2023 or 2024?\nWorkers are waking up to emails and team-meeting requests with a jarring message: They aren’t fired but their jobs are gone.\nPeople on the receiving end of these memos describe running through a range of emotions, from relief that they’re still employed to a sense of dread that their bosses secretly want them to leave.\nhttps://archive.ph/cYXyk\nhttps://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youve-heard-of-quiet-quitting-now-companies-are-quiet-cutting-ba2c326d', a user said: 'Yes. I know one of my friends who got quiet fired by a tech company. Out of the blue she was to attend an “important call” which was about her manager terminating her contract. Within 5 minutes, her accesses were revoked and she was placed on garden leave until her last day of work. No severance package. No questions allowed. It was really bizarre as she was the best performer in her team. Maybe the company just couldn’t afford good performers anymore and wants only mediocre employees.\nApparently this was in compliance with the labour laws in the country where she worked. It was mentioned in the law that “if employees are allowed to resign with notice, the same rule should apply to employers terminating their employees.”'"
