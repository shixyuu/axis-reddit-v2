        "In response to 'Basically we are at the point that a single income family making 100k a year but bought pre covid and locked in a 2.5% mortgage is in a better position than a dual income family post covid and 7% rate.\nThe point of dual income was to have a huge buffer and easily save.', a user said: 'I think your spot on with this. I’ve had this discussion many times recently with people. $100k a year, which don’t get me wrong is not a bad salary, is not what it was even 5-10 years ago. I’d say $100k today is what $50k was 15-20 years ago. Where I live you are going to have to spend about $300k to get a decent starter home that won’t require too much work on it. With that price, the rates the way they are, utilities factored in etc., your looking at $3k a month for that house. With a $100k salary, minus taxes, minus health insurance, 401k etc. (then factor in car payments, food, other bills) your not left with much. It’s honestly sad. I really feel for those people looking to purchase a home for the first time.'"
