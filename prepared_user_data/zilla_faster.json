        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: '> What is your opinion?\nMy opinion is that \"quietly quitting\" is the stupidest possible name for \"continuing to do your job to a sufficient level that might not get you promoted but doesn't get you fired\". It is also called \"doing your job\". It is absurd to try to craft a narrative around averagely-motivated people staying in their jobs as \"quitting\", its the opposite.\nCEO: thank you zilla for your many years of loyalty and work, which was a bit mediocre tbh but hey so are most people, here is your gold watch.\nMe, age 65: ha ha ha I 'quietly quit' 30 years ago and never told you.\nCEO: *shrugs* whatever gets you through the day old man'"
