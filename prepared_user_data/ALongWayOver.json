Like criticism so harsh you would feel like you were a moron but about things that weren’t fully in your control. And it wasn’t worthwhile to explain it.\nHe don’t do that anymore and hasn’t in the last 2-3 years. I recently found out he got medicine for his mood and antidepressants about 2.5 years ago. Not something you can actually do something about if you’re in the same situation but…yeah.'"
