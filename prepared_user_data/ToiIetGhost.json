        "In response to 'Oh man. I feel like your current experience is acting as my ghost of Christmas future.\nMy hubby grew up in a cat family, which nothing wrong with that I LOVE cats! He met me when my youngest pup was 2.5 y/o. \nRecently he tried to convince me to get a kitten from his friend whose cat recently had a litter. I told him no. Absolutely not.\nWe currently have 2 big dogs. one is very much getting closer to crossing the rainbow bridge (which will absolutely shatter me) and the other just turned 11 and has always been super needy/demanding. I told him no I don't want the added responsibility of cleaning litter, keeping track of cat food/treats, plus another basket of problems if cat doesn't have perfect health. He says he will take care of all the cat's needs. I know thats a load of shit since I currently take care of EVERYTHING related to our dogs. Food, health, grooming, ect. He is good at making sure the younger gets walked (ya know, the fun parts!) whether it be by walking him himself only on the weekends or guilting me into it because he works full time and I'm currently home during the week. Doesn't matter that I have terrible insomnia and may have only fallen asleep like 2 hours prior... I should still get up (and stay up) literally before dawn (summer in AZ so morning is the only time where pup won't burn his paws) to ensure pup gets his walk. PS pup doesn't go crazy if he's not walked everyday so it's not a crisis if he skips a day.\nI told him if he wants to get a baby pet we are getting another dog. He has NO IDEA of the amount of work that goes into raising a puppy into a well behaved dog. It's like training for a human baby and if he can't deal with everything that comes with raising a puppy then raising children with him may be off the table. He already thinks he's too old for a human baby (hes only 37 btw) and I know for a fact it didn't even cross his mind that maybe his idea of being too old for kids at 37 is insulting to me because my parents were 39 and 40 when I came into the picture, until I told him that...\nSorry for the rant.\nOP- How old are your kid(s) and how did infancy go with someone like your husband?', a user said: 'Like you said, couples often gets pets as a precursor to kids, almost like a test run. Let’s replace dogs with kids in your comment:\nHe says he will take care of all the child’s needs. I know thats a load of shit since I currently take care of EVERYTHING related to our kids. Food, health, grooming, ect. He is good at making sure the younger goes to the playground (ya know, the fun parts!) whether it be by taking him himself only on the weekends or guilting me into it because he works full time and I’m currently home during the week.\nDoesn’t matter that I have terrible insomnia and may have only fallen asleep like 2 hours prior... I should still get up (and stay up) literally before dawn (summer in AZ so morning is the only time where kiddo won’t get overheated) to ensure toddler gets his outdoor playtime.\nHe has NO IDEA of the amount of work that goes into raising a child into a well behaved adult.\nSo we already know that he\ncan’t\nrefuses to take care of an animal (through weaponised incompetence). He promises he will but he doesn’t.\nHe already thinks he’s too old for a human baby (hes only 37 btw)\nSo there you have it. I mean, he’s actually telling you that he isn’t really enthusiastic about being a parent. He thinks he’s too old for whatever reason—either he feels too tired to keep up with a kid, or like that time has passed, who knows. But this is him TELLING you that he’s not going to participate. Even if he did participate more than he initially said he would (even if he stepped up), would you really want a kid with anyone who’s less than thrilled? I mean, that’s how you get kids with absent parents who suffer from emotional neglect (your presence wouldn’t make up for dad’s subtle rejection every day).\nSo he’s shown he’s unwilling to care for something, and he’s explicitly stated that he’s not enthusiastic. If you had a kid despite knowing this, it would be unfair to the child. And yourself too, but the child didn’t ask to be born.'",
        "In response to 'He would not be an absentee dad. He would be a good parent but leave all of the mental load for me. Yeah no thanks.\nHe said he wishes he had kids when his parents did. First of all his parents married at like 23 and had him at 25. We didn't even meet each other until he was 28 and I was 25... I told him when we got serious that I need a ring before kids and it still took him 8 years to propose. This is all self imposed but he doesnt like hearing that, probably because he knows in the back of his mind that this is the bed he made. He has always wanted his cake and to eat it too, in fact he still struggles with that in various forms to this day.\nThe truth is I believe he likes the\nidea\nof kids (all the fun positive things, not the often un-fun realities and day to day grind) and wants to have them because society/family/whatever else dictates that \"its what you do\" not because he genuinely wants to be a dad.\nGood thing I don't conform to shit if I don't want to. I'm not one to be pushed around. I state my intentions from the start so there is no confusion about where I stand and nobody can say they \"didn't know\".\nHonestly my only fear is that he will resent me later down the road, even though it will be his own fault.\nIn all likelihood we won't have kids. Note: There's no chance of accidental pregnancy so i dont need to \"safeguard my BC\" like some may suggest.\nHe can be the fun uncle to all the niblings in both families and then hand them back to parents when things get unfun.', a user said: 'That makes a lot of sense. Good for you that you don’t let yourself be pushed around. No one’s gonna stand your ground for you, you’ve got to do it yourself. I hope he doesn’t resent you later, but if he does I know you won’t let him pin it on you.'",
        "In response to 'I did until the week prior  puppy pickup because I expressed the amount of work that goes into puppies , he had went shopping with me with the list of puppy supplies and made a few suggestions and even seemed very excited. The day after I had already saved a bunch of resources on puppy training, psychology, etc to help us get on the same page.l for consistency . I offered them to him since he's never had a dog before, I had had many dogs  but mostly duties were shared with my siblings and I as kids and I definitely needed a non-farm dog in the south refresher. He declined and said he'd figure it out. As they say in the memes \"It was then that I knew I had fucked up\".', a user said: 'Out of curiosity, why are you the primary parent? You both have jobs.'",
        "In response to 'I'm the primary parent because I personally sought out a different career that allowed me to care for my kid when he's sick and work remote. When my kid was an infant he seemed to get sicker than other kids, so I pivoted changed my job, picked up some certifications and that's all she wrote.', a user said: 'Oh, I understand. Then it does make sense for you to take over when your kid is sick (but on those days, your SO should be doing more around the house). However, outside of that, I hope that he participates equally in childcare from now on. Like you said, it’s time to stop over functioning. That means SO needs to wake up at the same time as you on weekends since your child is an early riser.'",
        "In response to 'I'm not trying to say jump straight to divorce or anything, but my philosophy is kind of \"if my life isn't better because you're in it, then why are you in it?\" It may sound selfish but I have no intentions of spending the one life I have being miserable or even unhappy so someone else can be happy. That doesn't include children of course, but someone you choose to be with should be someone who makes your life better, as you make their life better. Otherwise, what is the point? If he can't even understand that a pet is a responsibility and a living creature that needs tending, then what will it take to make him understand that you need tending and care? Thoughtfulness towards your partner isn't a big ask. It honestly should be part of your relationship and if it's not, well then what makes it a healthy relationship? Just make sure that you are spending as much effort making yourself happy as you do your partner. You deserve it, you need it.', a user said: 'It’s not selfish even one tiny bit. Both of you benefit, so it’s a win-win. Your life is better because he’s in it, and his life is better because you’re in it. That’s give and take, not selfish at all.\nI agree that this should be the main criterion. If it just meh or if they’re actively making your life harder, wouldn’t you rather be single and save all that energy for yourself, family, and friends? Because it’s wasted on the partner who doesn’t benefit you (in that case, they’re just taking). Or wouldn’t you rather put that energy towards looking for someone who’d lift you up? Don’t settle just because you’re afraid of being alone.'"
