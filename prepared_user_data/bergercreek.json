When I put in my notice at my old job I talked to leadership with full intentions of following through quitting on good terms, and they didn't make an offer but they told me not to be a snake in the grass, not to tell anyone what I would be making at my new job, and how disappointed they were that I was leaving. I felt they tried to bully me into staying. I left that day and never went back, and my new job values employees much more.\nIf your job is like mine was, start looking for a new one. It will be worth the switch.'"
