As things finish up and your workload lessens naturally as you transition out, so be it. You've likely done, on average, more than a full workload in the past, so getting paid to do a lesser workload for a bit as you find your next steps is just balancing things out.\nIf I was soft-money researcher, I be spending every minute right now applying for research focused industry jobs.  The model of academics is forever changed -- and research intensive universities are going to have to take a hard adjustment - for many, that means downsizing and it means if research funds get kicked back up in 4 years they will have to throttle what they commit to going after and doing because who knows low long that last. The very successful era of 80s years of unquestionable support for research is over.  I work at a institution that is like 60% teaching focused, 40% research  focused, and so our adjustments aren't quite as much, but looking at faculty numbers the key metrics are now student credit hours. I've been here 13 years, and this is the first time ever the provost is digging into how many credit hours everyone is teaching (at an individual level). Departments with lower undergrad enrollments, even if they have been high research performers, will reduce faculty lines (we can probably be okay with natural attrition).', a user said: 'Great, useful comment.'"
