        "In response to 'yeah until you get time theft for sitting in the break room', a user said: 'No you won't get time theft for that lol, if you do it excessive amount you'll get written up for TOT, not time theft. I've been doing it for a year and managers even seen me do it, they won't say anything as long as you are performing good and have good numbers.'",
        "In response to 'i've already got written up for time theft for sitting in the break room and others have too', a user said: 'Ok so explain how my managers seen me and others do it and never said anything? Ive never had one write up. You probably were in there for an hour or you're a slow worker. Or maybe your building is just more strict than mine. I assure you, nobody getting written up for \"time theft\" because they went and sit down for 10 minutes otherwise everyone going to take a shit would get written up. People go out for smoke breaks too none of them get written up.'",
        "In response to 'Hmm idk, I like taking all my off days in a row.', a user said: 'Donut is the best shift imo, because you still get the weekends off, and you get a day off inbetween so you are never extra tired from doing 4 in a row.'",
        "In response to 'until that met hit and you only get 1 consecutive day off, especially on nights when it won't even feel like a day off', a user said: 'If you want you can save your time off options for MET'"
