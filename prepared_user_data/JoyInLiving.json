        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I'll admit I used to look down on people who did the bare minimum at work as irresponsible, lazy bums. I always gave my best effort and looked for ways I could help out in all areas. How could they not care?? But at every job I've had, imo, it has gone unrecognized. At a couple jobs I was downright mistreated, if not abused. And for whatever reason, sometimes it's the losers who preserved their sanity. Better than I did anyway. So I think people like me got sick of giving their all to a company or a manager who views us as disposable. I've been taking a break from the workforce for several years and am in no rush to return due to my negative experiences. If / when I do go back, I will probably try be a minimalist from the start. Will I succeed at not caring? I don't know. Not caring is a skill. It doesn't come naturally to me. But I would try to care less. Except when it comes to teamwork. It's important to pull our weight & not leave everything to someone else. I've had a lazy team member before and it was stressful having to do my work plus theirs.'"
