        "In response to 'Original Post: What to do if my counterpart has \"quiet quit\"? One of my coworkers has been quiet quitting for a long time. But we're basically in a workplace where people are unfireable (government job). His boss does not seem to want to confront him about slacking, so instead, she gives his work to me and makes everything about \"we\" and \"us\" instead of \"him\".\nInstead of telling him directly, for example, \"hey PERSON X, why aren't you responding to my e-mails?\" She'll e-mail both of us and say \"Hey Team, why aren't you guys responding to my e-mails?\" (When it's very obviously him, not me.)\nWhen he decides not to do his work, she just gives his work to me.\nHonestly, I don't care if he quiet quits -- that's his business. But when his refusal to do work is falling on my table, that's where I start to see things getting problematic. How would you deal with this situation? Telling on him is not a good option, we are equals in the workplace and he considers me a friend.\nEDIT: Wow, so many responses! Yes perhaps my use of \"quiet quitting\" wasn't the right choice of words. My coworker came into my office on Friday and told me he doesn't \"give a f***\" about this job but he feels powerful because he feels \"unfireable\". He spends the entire day working on his own stuff (he has a few side jobs that he does). Our boss seems to be intimidated by him and takes the easy way out - instead of giving work to someone who's going to push back, she'll dump it on others instead. Firing someone is an extremely complicated and long process here, and probably not something she wants to go through. The boss is in her third trimester of pregnancy and getting ready to go on maternity leave. My coworker and I have similar job descriptions so it's easy to give his work to me. Addressing the \"friend\" issue: yeah, I don't really know if \"friend\" was the right word here either. But we're equals and I guess you could say \"friendly\" to each other. Coworker brings me baked goods sometimes, has invited me to get-togethers, things like that. Situation really sucks.', a user said: 'Set your limits. 8hrs (maybe 8.5 if you want to be generous) do what work you can and call it a day. Someone calls after hours, direct them to the other person as youre past your limit.\nWork isnt getting done,.. tell the manager to hire someone else. Cant afford it in the budget, well thats the managers job to figure out.'",
        "In response to 'Funnily enough this is what quiet quitting actually is! It's sad seeing corporate interests manipulate the term to be a negative thing when it should be common sense.', a user said: 'Soft disagree.\nQuiet quitting is doing only enough to avoid being fired. What i am saying is more in line with work to the rule. Put forth effort work hard, but hold the hard line divider on what is work and what is not.\nIn situations like this (saw a co-worker go through this in a govt job; they and their team mate were FTEs and i was a contractor) there is a tendency to just do all the work no matter how long it takes. Cancel vacations, work weekends all that crap,.. and you cant do that to yourself. The boss knows whats going on, but the bosses boss likely doesnt. You put in your 40-45 hrs and fet done what you can. Things fall behind,..? Well then you can say im working 40hrs and look at all the work i do. We need more people if you want more work to get done.'",
        "In response to 'Actually, quiet quitting is when you stick to the job description without going above and beyond or working crazy hours. As you can see in the original post, the coworker is doing far less than that and is still apparently doing enough to avoid being fired. And on the contrary, there are many businesses where sticking to the job description will still get you fired for \"not being engaged enough\" or some other nonsense. Overall the line you have to avoid crossing in order to not be fired is quite variable and by no means part of the definition of quiet quitting.\nHowever you are entirely right in your last paragraph, people tend to let themselves be taken advantage of far too often in this day and age.', a user said: 'I was Going by the op’s coworker doing less than expected and not being fired, and using that as the baseline for qq.\nFor the sake of this discussion, no more use of quiet quiting.\nOp should work to the rule to combat the short timing co worker.\nDoes that fit out better?'",
        "In response to '8? Not many jobs-especially government jobs-expect one to work constantly for an entire shift.', a user said: 'Not saying it has to be contiguous,..  just put in what you gotta do (8/9 whatever hours) and cut yourself off. Youre doing the work of two people and not getting paid the second salary. The more you work past you require salary hours, the less hourly wage you make.\nFor your own mental health, set the limit and stick to it. Boss asks why xyz didnt get done,… “sorry, i was working on lmnop, and it was due earlier. I didnt have enough time to work on both.”'",
        "In response to 'I've wondered if anyone has just not gone in and kept working. I have a feeling most offices would take weeks to even figure it out and it would be the same as quiet quitting', a user said: 'Took about 6m but a colleague got fired suddenly because of this. No real warning.\nHe was listed as RTO but they were closing the office he was supposed to be going to and figured since the next closest office was way beyond that, RTO didnt apply to him.\nWorst part, they didnt notify his manager or executive until the day of his termination either. HR did the firing all by themselves and notified our manager after the fact.'",
        "In response to 'Still gets unemployment', a user said: 'He did yes,.. but in FL (where he was; im in a different state) unemployment is a bit of a joke compared to what he was earning. Or so i hear.'",
        "In response to 'It usually is but the post was about making them fire you', a user said: 'Your parent comment was about just not going back. Thats what my colleague did. Just never went. And this is what he got.'"
