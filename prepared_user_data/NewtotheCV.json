I’m cheering on the younger generations for breaking out of the horrible loop of “go above and beyond and be rewarded with more work and no extra compensation”.\nI learned my lesson a little late in life but you better believe I’m implementing work to rule here on out.

After 35 years she got those extra hours, for 5 years before she retired.\nI don't do anything extra as a rule UNLESS they are a good employer and I know they will have my back when I need it. However, those employers are few and far between in my experience but I also spent half my work in the public sector where wages/work do not mingle, just time spent.'"
