        "In response to 'You clearly were a team player and the one time your boss disliked the way you handled a perfectly normal venting session, he ruined that for all.\nI worked at a small call center (13 people on staff) for 5 years. I would do little extra things like bring in snacks, utensils, napkins, candy jar for the break room, etc. I would pick up extra shifts when someone called in. Organize the signing of birthday cards, celebrations, holidays, and whatnot. I went the extra mile on everything.\nWhen my grandma passed away, they refused to give me my 3 days of bereavement leave, which was standard. I worked a 12 hour graveyard shift at the time. I ended up working my night shift, going to the rosary and the wake, napping for a few hours then working again. I was only granted the day of the funeral because I called in.\nAfter that I realized they didn't give an iota about me so why should I do anything but the bare minimum.\nNTA.', a user said: 'Work your wage until you find some place that appreciates your efforts. Glad that's behind you.'"
