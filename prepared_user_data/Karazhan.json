        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'I hate it. As a manager I hate it. If someone on the team wishes to come in and do only their hours then that's fine. There is nothing in the contract that says you need to consistently go above and beyond and I can say from experience that it only leads to burnout in the end. Damaging a team and someone's mental health for someone's idea of \"doing the best for the company at all times\" is abhorrent.'"
