        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I was a zombie for a few years there, barely participating... to the point where I just couldn't motivate myself to do even essential work... but then my wife died and everything changed.  The people at my work were\nfantastic\n... other people picked up my workload in a second and without and complaining, I got cards and flowers and regular contact from literally everyone... and for her funeral everyone came including some of the Board Members and even a few of our customers.\nOn top of that I had a few months off and they paid me the whole time even though I had like four days leave accrued.\nI feel like their people I should work hard to support in return.'",
        "In response to 'Any reason why you were a zombie to begin with?', a user said: 'It was a few things... but the primary reason was I ran into someone at dinner and I barely recognised them... then they went on to tell my wife about how we once spent five months of our lives working 18 hour days in a sea-container-office in Brunei trying to delivering two years of work before the end of the financial year.\nWe achieved the goal and saved the contract, and 500 people kept their jobs... which is good... but then he told me that the system was demo to the client and then immediately shut down and never actually used... so I reflected on the fact that pretty much everything I had ever done was probably discarded by now and I had spent twenty five years of my life working stupid-hard on things that didn't really matter.'"
