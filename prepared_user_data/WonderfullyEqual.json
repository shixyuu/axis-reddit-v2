That’s awful for you guys, genuinely.', a user said: 'That’s awful for you guys, genuinely.\n99.99% of the time you get paid on time, and depending on the bank it can post early. 0.01% of the time it can be all sorts of fucked, and take weeks to months to fix. Like they at times issue double pay by mistake, and then simply hold the next periods pay to correct for it, or they issue the wrong housing allowance, and then take 6 months to pay you the corrected difference.\nThe problem with that 0.01% of issues comes with the fact that a ton of service members cant manage their finances worth fuck all at any time... you get the peeps who spend that double pay the 1st weekend they have it, and have nothing in savings, others have a 10 year car loan at like 35% interest on some shitty used charger etc. so on, and so forth.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: My last paycheck didn’t deposit. Hey yall!! I posted last week about how my boss blew a hissy fit when I called in once because I was grieving the loss of my dad.\nNow my last paycheck didn’t deposit this morning!! I texted my coworkers and I know at least one of them got paid. But this is a common occurrence, she always seems to fuck up payroll somehow. (This is the 7th time payroll has been fucked in the year I worked there). I’m pissed because now I have to reach out to her and I “quietly quit” so I was hoping I wouldn’t have to do that.\nSpeaking of which, I approached her about the text hoping to have a productive conversation. I took accountability for calling in after having so much time off for his hospital stay, death and funeral. She started going on about how she’s been looking for her “fourth token” meaning she has had 3 employees that work for her who are all subpar human beings, and she’s looking for a 4th person to help her run the shop/support her/be a normal human being… well I don’t feel like I’m her fourth token and I don’t want to be. So I left this letter and my key, packed my shit and didn’t go back.', a user said: 'On a side note, who the hell calls their employees \"tokens\"?'"
