        "In response to 'Education would be so much better off in this county if we still allowed families to be supported by a single income. Imagine if most of your students had a parent with 40 hours more time available each week.', a user said: 'Plenty of families are supported by a single income because they have a single parent. It’s extremely privileged to think that every child has two parents or other relatives at home.\nWhat really needs to happen is living wages and shorter workdays. It’s absurd to think that people should work 8 hours plus an hour lunch break (which is really an extra hour spent at work often) plus a commute that can easily add an extra hour. Add in getting dressed and ready for work. \nWhen exactly are we supposed to have a life? When are we supposed to be involved in our communities, spend time with our children? \nWe need shorter work days, more flexible schedules and more hybrid options.'"
