        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I don't see why it's wrong when you're not paid more, you're not being valued or anything. Why should we work our ass off more for basically nothing ? Sadly I've seen more exemples of companies taking advantage of their employee than rewarding hard work.\nI had a summer job once for a new section of the company and the girl who was supervising us suddenly left so I somehow got in her role of managing everything but still with the shitty pay of a basic seasonal employee. I did the bare minimum when I understood what they were trying to do.'"
