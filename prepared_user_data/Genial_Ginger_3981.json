        "In response to 'They’re the generation whose parents work and work, and their hard work isn’t being rewarded by their employers and society writ large. There’s simply no incentive to work hard anymore, college doesn’t guarantee good jobs anymore so why work hard in high school if you’re not going to college.

There’s just a general depression among peoples reward connection to hard work, rightfully so, our society’s priorities are wildly misaligned. By hey, just appreciate the fact we have jobs and a shelter, and enjoy the downhill ride that is modern civilization.', a user said: 'This needs to be the top comment.
