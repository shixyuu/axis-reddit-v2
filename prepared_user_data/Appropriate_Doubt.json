        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'Business owner perspective here: why go above and beyond if you aren’t being compensated for it? \nBecause eventually the market will turn, the recession will be announced and jobs will dry up. Companies that aren’t recession proof will be forced into layoffs and your name will be on the short list. Remember, everyone is replaceable. If you are pissing off the boss, he/she will find a way to get rid of you and replace you.'"
