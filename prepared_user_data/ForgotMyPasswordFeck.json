I have worked for every last penny of that but I would guess this is why other people as well do more than what is expected. I think this only works for some jobs however. If I was in a job where I knew progression was never going to happen then I wouldn’t put in as much effort.', a user said: 'In my experience it’s definitely the opposite.
