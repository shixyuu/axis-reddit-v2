        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: '\"Work to rule\" is a legal form of job action that traditionally was done during union contracts to avoid illegal wildcat strikes. It's very similar to \"quiet quitting\" except it's intention was to be a collective action that cause disruption, while \"quiet quitting\" is more on an individual basis to maintain a status quo and the persons well-being. However, neither of these things would be required if capitalist systems didn't take advantage of the average worker. So I certainly encourage people to \"quiet quit\" if they feel they can without risking livelihood. But the term itself is problematic as it's used by those in positions of power to discredit a legitimate practice: do what you get paid for, nothing more.'"
