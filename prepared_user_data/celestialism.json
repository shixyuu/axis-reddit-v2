        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'The term itself is problematic because it implies that employees should have to view their work as more than just their work in order to deserve to make a living. We live under capitalism; everyone needs to contend with the issue of money in one way or another, and so it’s naïve and often exploitative for employers to expect (or even demand) that their workers put in more effort than their job description or salary can justify.'"
