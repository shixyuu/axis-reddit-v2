For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Companies sensationalizing this term to put doubts in people's minds that knowing how to balance work and your personal life is being lazy and stupid. Many companies demand so much but can't provide enough compensation to their employees and that is hypocrisy. Don't ask what you can't give, simple as that.'"
