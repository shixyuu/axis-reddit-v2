It's not my company. I get paid the same amount whether or not I work my ass off or do bare minimum.\nI'm not advocating working hard for no recognition.\nThat's\nliterally\nwhat you're advocating. You're saying giving anything less than 110% is \"delivering a shitty version of yourself.\"\nthe best way I got back at them was to improve myself and make more money\nOnly way to do that is get a new job. Your current employer isn't gonna care one bit about your expanded skillset. Why, exactly, should your job get 110% if they won't pay for it?\nBut in your scenario you'd still be working for him just somehow feeling superior because you're only working at half speed?\nThere's that advocating hard work for no recognition again.\nIt's a\nreally\nsimple concept: you get what you pay for. You want your employees to work their asses off for you? Better make sure you're paying them work their asses off salaries.'",

It is not their life, and many people could care less about giving 100% to a job. They're there for a paycheck so they can continue to live and pursue the things that really matter to them.\nYou might find it personally repugnant giving less than 100%. That fine. But other people\nare not you\n. They want to be remembered for things outside of the thing they did to survive. As a sidenote, if you define your legacy as your job...well, that's kind of the problem.'"
