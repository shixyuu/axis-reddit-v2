        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting - How do I do it properly Been at J2 for 9 months. Reorg in March completely dismantled my team. Manager new what was happening and fled to a new team.\nWas assigned to a new team a couple of months ago. Have not had any work assigned in almost a month. I log on. Attend a couple of team meetings. And that is it. Asked my current (new) manager if there were opportunities to hop on other projects. They pretty much responded by telling me to enjoy the free time and that they would get back to me. A new manager for my team will be hired within the next month.\nI've applied for an internally posted role with no success. No response to application.\nAny thoughts on how to handle this situation. I literally am doing nothing and earning a paycheck. Am I wrong to continue logging in until I get let go?\nThought about taking PTO for a week. Thinking now that I should just save my PTO, log in, start my mouse jiggler, and go about my business.', a user said: 'This type of thing kept happening every 6-9 months at J1 which is why after a while I said to myself, \"I gotta OE and taking advantage of this down time I keep having!\"\nMy boss fucks off to India for at least a month every year and I hardly hear from him or get assigned anything to work on during that time. I can let small tasks that should take me an hour take a week during that month and nobody says a word. Then regular re-orgs on top of that where the shuffling around of people and teams reduces demands on productivity to a crawl. It's practically an OE wet dream.'"
