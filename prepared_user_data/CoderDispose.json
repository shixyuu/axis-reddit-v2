You still go in and sit at your desk or whatever, collecting a paycheck, but you just sit around until they really do fire you. It sounds like it got conflated with some other idea.'",
        "In response to 'As far as I know the term has always meant to complete the minimum requirements of the job and not going above and beyond. When it first got coined that’s what Bryan Creely was referring to… people that did the bare minimum.', a user said: 'That's kind of a silly term then, because what he says and what it means are unrelated. Doing your work duties is not quitting, in any sense of the word.'",
        "In response to 'Exactly. The guy who coined the term is a corporate recruiter and business manager/owner coach so that tells you exactly where his thought processes are.', a user said: 'Thanks for the clarification!'"
