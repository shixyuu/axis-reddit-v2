        "In response to 'I am curious as to why the company would contest from someone receiving unemployment benefits? Do they(the company) lose money?  isnâ€™t it gov. money?', a user said: 'Companies pay a percentage of employee wages into state unemployment tax. In the case of the company I work for, a political consulting firm, where we work in about 30+ states a year, wherever your employee is stationed doing their work, you pay taxes. When employees from your company file for unemployment, they draw from those taxes. If the bill of your ex-employees' UI payments at the end of the year is greater than the amount you paid in, you owe the state those taxes by April. If you paid more, state refund. As you can imagine with the natural ebb and flow of companies of any size, most companies don't get state refunds. Some of them choose to battle that by pettily contesting their ex-employees' UI claims. Others, like my firm, choose to combat that by training and retaining employees.\nIt's one of the many circle-jerks between states and corporations meant to entice companies choosing where to operate based on tax incentives and in turn employing people, and keeping them employed, in their state.'"
