Most employment arrangements I've seen consist of a job description that has lots of language like \"may include...  \" and \"and other tasks as required\", an agreement to a general employee handbook, code of conduct, etc., so requirements are vague and spread throughout multiple unrelated documents.\nI've never had a job where there was something like \"configure 3 end points and one server per day\", it's always been more like \"support enterprise IT deployment process.\"\nMaybe if you worked on an assembly line with a quota \"doing exactly what I'm contracted for\" would make sense, but at least for knowledge workers, it's largely unintelligible.'",

Work to rule is a union concept. The vast majority of us are not in unions.'"
