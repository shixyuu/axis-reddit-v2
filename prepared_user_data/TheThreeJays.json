        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'Quit, put all loans on 5 year rate and interest only, rented out our home and  a rental and went to rent a lifestyle block but un a quiet faming area to spend more time with the kids\nThe 5 year ends this July.\nI went back to work mid last year. It's was amazing to get that tike off so young to spend with my family.\nBut I'm feeling the repercussions now from being out of the workforce in banking.'"
