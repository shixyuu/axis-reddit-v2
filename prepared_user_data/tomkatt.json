        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting: What is it Really? Quiet quitting is a confusing term to me, but maybe I just don’t understand it. I have rarely ever given 120% to a job… maybe when I was fresh out of college when I had that mindset. But the years have jaded me. What people call “quiet quitting” (doing the minimum) is what I just call doing my job lol. It’s not like I refuse when they ask me to do more work (tho rarely do they ask), but I don’t SEEK more work out unless I’m just bored. For example, in my work, we work in Sprints and get assigned stories to do for those sprints. I just do those stories — not more or less — unless I’m just bored and have finished my stories weeks in advance, then I may grab a story for the next Sprint. I get paid by the hour so no work means no pay. But it’s not like I can ADD more stories to the current Sprint because someone else still needs to test them and THEY may not have capacity. So, a lot of times I just do things around the house since there always seems to be something to do at home. Have I been quiet quitting for years and just didn’t know it or is doing the minimum not really what quiet quitting is all about?', a user said: 'My understanding is “quiet quitting” isn’t quitting at all unless you’re not meeting expectations. It’s just a hostile term for not grinding yourself to scraps for some company until there’s nothing left for you. I say screw that.\nMy last job I gave 100% consistently, IMO above and beyond expectations. And don’t get me wrong, I was rewarded for it, both in accolades and financially, but I also completely burned out and became entirely demotivated after a few years.\nMy current job my average output is more like 50% to maybe 65% consistently. I don’t overly stress, it’s generally cushy, and I can and do scale up my effort when it’s explicitly needed. I still receive accolades and commensurate pay (and bonuses), and I’m recovering from burnout now and am in a better place.\nSome might call not putting in maximal effort “quiet quitting” but I just don’t see it that way. I’m productive enough to perform well, my work is recognized, and I’m maintaining my sanity and well being. That’s just better all around.'",
        "In response to 'your theory is only valid if said employee is diligently working for the entire 40 hours a week.\nmost job descriptions include other tasks that are expected to be completed in slow work times. yet a lot of workers use the rationalization that \"i was hired as a salesperson [for example], so i'm not gonna do any cleaning or stocking or customer service etc when there are no customers present.\"\nthe employer has a right to expect that an employee will be busy for the entire time for which they are being paid, and so those \"other\" tasks are likely included in the job description. when they are in the job description, the employee is expected to take the\ninitiative\nto take up those tasks when they have capacity. the employer should not have to babysit their employees to see who is not busy and assign work. the employee should not even need to go \"ask\" what needs to be done.\nyet often, if those tasks do not align with the employee's \"title\", the employee feels perfectly justified scrolling reddit or some nonsense during what they perceive to be their \"downtime\". THAT is a problem.', a user said: 'This is a weird take, especially compared to stocking and cleaning. Those are simple physical tasks the majority of people could do on autopilot, and not the sort of thing that relates to WFH.\nMuch of work is mental, not physical, and both mental load and capacity are variable values. One day’s 100% could be another day’s 70%.\nI don’t think the discussion has anything to do with refusing or neglecting specific duties. Then again, I dunno, my job is not at all physical and just 100% mentally taxing. Some days you’re on, other days you don’t have it.\nMy attitude is if you’re paying me, I’m working. But I’m also only human. I can’t put out a consistent output to exact spec every day.'",
        "In response to 'i get that the example i used was not the best in the context of the op, but it was what i had in the moment, so i went with it.\nmy point was that while on the clock, an employee should be doing something (whether mentally or physically) to advance the mission of the company. sometimes that may be sitting back and pondering the pros and cons of a developing marketing plan. that's fine. but watching reels and swapping them with your fb friends is not productive work, and there's likely something more productive that the person doing so could be engaged in when in downtime from their \"main\" work.\nthat's all i was saying.', a user said: 'I get you. And yeah, much as downtime matters mentally, you’re not paid to watch TikTok. Work hours are for work.\nI guess I think more task oriented these days since I’m salary in recent years. The hours matter less, some days are longer, some shorter, it’s more flexible.'"
