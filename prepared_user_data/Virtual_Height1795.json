        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I quiet quit around then. 2 years later I took a redundancy. Now 1.5 years on, I am still looking for a full-time role.'"
