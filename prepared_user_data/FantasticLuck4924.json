        "What happened with quiet quitting? I'm definitively going to start quiet quitting this next month. I'm not proud to work at my current company (quite the opposite) and my boss thinks he's paying to make me his slave.\nBut I was looking for tips on how to start quiet quitting here on Reddit and I could only find old posts. It seems like it's not a thing anymore. Is quiet quitting dead? What have I missed?",
        "In response to 'It's been a couple years of quiet quitting for myself.  I don't know why they haven't fired my ass.', a user said: 'I've noticed that people who work less usually are good communicators, at least from my experience, much more likely to be earning more than the ones that actually work. Unfortunately, I'm not a good\nliar\ncommunicator xD'",
        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is just doing your job.', a user said: 'It sounds like not doing my job'",
        "In response to 'The first rule of quiet quitting is you don't talk about quiet quitting.\n(I'm at work right now.  Typing this is what I'm doing)', a user said: 'Good point, some of my coworkers are for sure equally mad, but I'll keep it a secret. In case working just the time I'm supposed to isn't enough and they end up doing more so they won't be mad at me doing it on purpose'",
        "In response to 'Why quiet quit when you can use an automation tool to reduce your work?', a user said: 'because I left my job ðŸ˜Ž\n(found a better one closer to my house)'"
