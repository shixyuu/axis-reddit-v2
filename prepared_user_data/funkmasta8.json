Here is an article saying total costs in the cheapest group (in state public universities) average around 27k/year. If you look at the other groups, they are much worse. For the worst group (private universities) you could accrue over 215k in debt over four years.\n10k isn’t even enough to get people out of the hole enough that they can start paying off the interest at an appreciable rate'",
        "In response to 'I have no idea where you're getting the $27K/year figure.\nhttps://www.ontocollege.com/average-college-tuition/\nThis link says the average is $9K, which is in line with my own experience.', a user said: 'Oops, forgot to add the link. My bad. Here it is\nlink\nAs for your article, you literally chose the lowest group and used it as your average. Most people don’t attend two year universities. Further, these numbers all say tuition costs, which does not include other costs such as housing, food, and books. All three of those other costs have become cash cows for universities by way of jacking up the prices and forcing their students to buy them by having school policies saying that students in their first two years have to live on campus and buy a meal plan of a certain size under the guise of “protecting the students from themselves”. This often continues to a lesser extent in the later years of the degree'"
