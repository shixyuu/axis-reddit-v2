        "In response to 'One of my previous employers called it \"managing out of position\" in that there was a series of tactics used to convince someone to quit as opposed to firing them. â˜¹', a user said: 'I gave a three weeks notice once. Manager didnâ€™t schedule me another hour after that conversation. I know itâ€™s a little different but in the same vein. I still needed the hours and pay. I had planned for the money and to continue working for them until the pre determined date, plus a week of courtesy!'",
        "In response to 'Absolutely trash. That's more than accommodating enough to your employer to give them that much time. It's almost like that have a shortage of good workers that want to work for them for that wage and condition', a user said: 'Withheld my last check because I didnâ€™t bring back a shirt. They didnâ€™t tell me I had to turn it in if I left when they issued it to me. Let my buddies dog play with it, tug o war, shredded to pieces and covered with slobber, brought it in as is and got my check.'",
        "In response to '\".... And if you'll note in the employment contract, which I agreed to.... 'All property must be returned upon termination'. Which I did\"', a user said: 'never signed a thing. Handshake and a smile.\nBut I get you, I did bring it back ðŸ˜‰'"
