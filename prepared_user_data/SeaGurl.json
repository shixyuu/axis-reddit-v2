        "In response to 'I'm from the UK so I'm not sure how it works in the US but how does someone get $100k in debt from student loans? Quick google showed the average course for a state college is $10k for a US resident and a private college was about $35k, and thats for the fully course not per year.\nI'm asking because in the UK out student works like this, when you apply for a higher education course so college or uni you're allowed up to 4 years of tuition from the government, It basically gives you a cap so you can never get into that sheer amount of debt. And once you start earning I think its Â£25k a year you then have X amount taken out of your pay basically like an extra tax.', a user said: 'Oh thats per year and\njust\nfor courses not living expenses (which were roughly equal to my tuition prices)  so you're looking at 20k a year x 4 years, 80k.  Then, unless you were poor, interested has been accruing the entire 4 years.\nThen, because a lot of us graduated during the 2008 financial crisis + 2020, a lot of people had to take deals to pay less then the minimum payment and thats caused interest to balloon.'",
        "In response to 'Exactly what happened to me. Good thing every adult told me that education debt was \"good debt\" and that it wouldn't keep you from getting a house, etc. Such a load of bullshit through and through.', a user said: 'Yup!  Total BS.'"
