        "In response to 'Why is it called quiet quiting? I feel like this is an attempt to make us feel bad, but it's something we all should try out.', a user said: 'I assume it has that name because people only start doing it once they don't care if they get fired but honestly I've been doing it since my adulthood. The majority of management have their heads so up their asses that they don't recognize individual efforts, let alone everyday for 8h straight. It doesn't deserve our time and energy, no matter the field of work. The company will still carry on and people fail to see it'",
        "In response to 'Could you please point out which one?\nI actually have only done freelance online jobs so I would love to know the reality of corporations.', a user said: 'In the company where I work - big boss died a few years ago but when he was alive all the leeches got their places in management because they licked his shoes in every single way. For example, there is a gym inside the property that belongs to the company, big boss had squash lessons there and the coach gave them for free, after a couple months that coach is the gym manager. Meanwhile my manager is a jackass, despises everyone, he is always right and has the mentality of \"if the job is successful it's because of me, if it fails it's my employees that can't do shit\". In the beginning I would work hard and  get constantly spit on, now I do the bare minimum, I'm rarely on my desk and when I'm working I take triple the time to finish the task and the manager says my working method has improved. If they don't see you, they can't remember you. If they don't remember you, they don't have bad things to point out'"
