I spent 5 years working in a bank, from grunt to leading a team directly under executives. I can tell you honestly that many, many people there are just punching the timesheet. At all levels.\nThe folks who have it figured out and do the bare minimum that pushes the needle? Good for them.\nBut the bullshit artists that posture and drift out of their lanes and make more work for everyone? They're everywhere.\nIf I was CEO I wouldn't stress out about the folks who live for something else than corporate glory. I'd stress out about the lazy idiots who live for nothing other than corporate glory.'"
