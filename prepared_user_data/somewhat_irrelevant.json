        "In response to 'Perpetuating the “QQ” corporate double-speak does all of us a disservice. Stop using that phrase. It’s insulting in the extreme.', a user said: 'I've kamikazied before because I knew as long as I didn't get fired I would be able to get the same job. I think it's a more fitting phrase that doesn't imply self service, which is something no one my age does. You know you'll never go anywhere, but you're qualified for the position, so you go kamikaze on everything you disagree with, don't let your job steal an inch of your integrity, and eventually get the same job somewhere else.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah …. There’s nothing in this video.  As someone who manages hundreds of people, I’m not sure what she means by ‘manufactured chaos used to control people’.   I just wanna build software.  I’ll pay a competitive wage to get top talent. It’s on me if I’m not paying enough.   And all I’m looking for in return is to do the job we agree on upfront.  Recession isn’t going to change that for me…. If someone wants to work, has the skills I need, I’ll make it worth their while.  And there are a lot of people like me trying to build something.   I truly don’t understand what the giant conspiracy is that she seems to think is occurring.', a user said: 'Don't worry, no one is quiet quitting. It's a phrase made up by the boomer tube. They loved how well \"lying flat\" did from China, so they fabricated another strawman label. Notice how no one knew what it was in this community, which aggregates pro labor ideas, until some bullshit interview on mainstream media.'"
