        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Just curious, why didnâ€™t you call though? Itâ€™s always easier for me to call because people arenâ€™t always by their phones. 95% of the time people answer calls if they are slow with texting. I can understand the frustration of the customer in this situation. She contacted you right after the timer ran out so you..say tough shit and screenshot this to post on Reddit? Ok lol'"
