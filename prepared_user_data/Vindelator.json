I've had the most stressful 5 months doing the role of 7 other people,  no payrise with a promotion being dangled in front of me, and then snatched away. I don't want to make any big, positive changes for the company. I feel pretty bitter right now.', a user said: 'My suggestion here is to act always in your own self interest. (even if you're pissed)\nDon't do anything to fuck over your employer out of spite...at least nothing that can harm or diminish your career.\nHonestly, most of the jobs I've gotten have come from the people I know. So good contacts and a good reputation is cash in your wallet.\nTldr:\nDon't burn bridges.\nDo leave hide old cans of tuna in the office, leave a shit review on glass door, subscribe your old boss to creepy porn newsletters.'"
