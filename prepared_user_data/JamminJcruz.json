        "In response to 'I worked at a pizza shop in college. I had a mild flu and had to call in sick. He told me to get a doctor's note, and I told him to give me $120 for my doctor's visit. Then he didn't put me on the schedule for three weeks. He finally put me on again, except it was for a weekend I had requested off months ago, and then he didn't tell me he added me to the schedule so he was surprised to find out I was out of the state...', a user said: 'Back when I was 21 I requested a Sunday off months in advance for a Football game my whole family was going to. Maybe like 16 deep.\nGot denied to have the day off and told my boss a week prior that I won’t make it in next Sunday.\nHe told me, “You Have to Work Your Scheduled shifts.”\nI told him I’m going to the football game and if that’s the case then I’m probably not going to be “feeling good” that day so he should probably get someone else to cover before that day comes.\nTold me I have to call in the day of.\nSo I called in while in the stands with 60,000 people. He was pissed but I didn’t care. Like I can’t find another minimum wage job? The Store Managers at these minimum wage jobs are delusional and there’s a reason why they’re still at those kinds of places.'"
