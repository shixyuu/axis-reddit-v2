        "In response to 'OP I don’t think you know what “Quiet Quitting” is because then you would know… It doesn’t exist, it’s a BS term made to further shame working employee’s. The definition of “QQ” is… Doing the job you were hired to do and no more(which is what EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO DO). This is also known as a person job duties. If a person is doing their job they ARE quiet quitting. It’s a complete nonsense term.\nPlease don’t use terms like this that some AH came up with to shame people for doing what they were hired to do. If your teammate isn’t doing his job that isn’t quiet quitting, that’s just failing to do their job.', a user said: 'This. Quiet quitting means not going above and beyond and just sticking to your own duties and responsibilities, it does not mean slacking and not doing your job you’re paid for.'"
