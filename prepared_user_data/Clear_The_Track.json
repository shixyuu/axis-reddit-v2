        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! 🙏', a user said: 'I quiet quit a while ago, and for me it boils down to doing my job at an adequate enough level to not be fired.  Do what you’re supposed to do and nothing more.  Learn to say no to requests that go over and above.  Work your required hours and nothing more.\nWhat not to do: pout or act like what you’re doing is a form of protest.  Make your attitude/psychology seem totally well-adjusted and normal.  Be respectful to authority.  Just tone down your need to win every day and seek acceptance.  You’d be surprised in the long run, like I was, how good this is for your long term mental health.'",
        "In response to 'Thank you!\nI am interested to know more about your second paragraph. I was also advised to be “pleasant” and not act like a protester, remaining normal and well adjusted. Why is this important? And any examples of bad protester behaviors you’ve seen?', a user said: 'So I quiet quit because I was actually offered certain promotions by managers that then magically seemed to be overturned in favour of less competent co workers who were usually charismatic.  The first few times I kind of stomped my feet and asked “why”.  This didn’t go well.  They’re not going to turn around and say, “Yeah you’re right!  What we did was totally unfair and we’ll change it right away!”  They’ll give you a bunch of weird explanations, ascribing (or exaggerating) characteristics to the person that got the job that are mostly untrue.  Fact is they just like the guy.  Then off record someone will tell you that they kiboshed your advancement because you’re too valuable where you are.\nWhen you decide to quiet quit, I would warn you that it’s a totally different direction.  You have to be okay with just being a nobody.  Heck, I even actively promote talented colleagues that I used to be in direct competition with (your co workers will love you and they’ll be asked to do extra work instead of you).  When I pass the people that passed me over for promotions, they get an enthusiastic smile and “hello” now.  I’m now more likeable than ever, while doing way less and working at a way slower pace.  They will put up with this behaviour because they’re so snowed by this “mature attitude”.  If this isn’t for you then you have to find another job asap.'",
        "In response to 'This is wise here. How did you learn to be ok being a nobody?  Harsh words but exactly how I feel now. I’m in stage where I stomped my feet and asked why. And now I’m feeling like I’m being buried alive under a bunch of incompetent aholes who somehow are succeeding over me.', a user said: 'Part of it is right in your comment.  It’s the realization that what you’re doing, however valiant, isn’t working.  And also that your supervisor or management isn’t going to overturn an unfair decision no matter what you do.  Sometimes this isn’t even about how promotable you are.  It’s about someone being extremely happy with your performance in an underling role.\nAnyway there’s a saying about “the definition of insanity” that I think about often.  Like I said in a previous comment: if you’re not okay with toning it down and fading into the background, it’s best to find a new job.  In my case, I get paid a lot and would be crazy to formally quit.'",
        "In response to 'This is so accurate. I was eviscerated in a thousand little cuts review when I tried to switch to a different team and got blocked.\nI was told “you can be doing your job but still not meeting expectations”\nI finally had to take fmla for a medical issue and have been peeking in and my boss has stolen multiple ideas of mine and not credited me while I am gone.\nI have decided to do a career shift that will take a few years so I am in full quiet quit mode when I get back.\nAny suggestions of how to handle reviews/1:1s? The trust with my lead is obliterated.', a user said: 'So the point of quiet quitting is doing the minimum amount it takes to hold onto your job, because you still need it.  You’re just dialling back all the things that in your mind, made you a great employee instead of a good one.\nIn order to offset this new attitude, I highly recommend being ultra-pleasant when dealing with co workers and supervisors.  If you come in with the idea that “everyone is going to pay for what they did to me”, it will be noticeable right away.  Instead you’re going to snow everyone with a super positive version of yourself.  Seems painful, but you might be surprised.  It might actually make your life easier.  A lot of people don’t care about how good a worker you are, but rather, whether or not you’re likeable.\nBut for example, you will no longer have “good ideas” unless your basic job requires that you have them.  Alternatively, if you have to have good ideas, try to make them more public.  I had a boss that wanted to be a middle man to all of my emails.  He would get questions from higher-ups and then privately forward me the emails.  Then he could receive my responses and make himself look smart.  So when I responded, I added all the management back into the emails, to let them know the answer was coming from me lol.  My boss immediately stopped doing that.'",
        "In response to 'Thanks for the response! I got you- yeah it was hard for me to be too pleasant because I had a health issue that was making it extremely difficult to even exist without pain. That has since improved. \n \nI found out my boss stole two ideas from me and presented the proposals as his own since I have been gone- which of course. I have just been the dog he has needed to kick since our team output is strong but he feels the need to no longer “inflate feedback” despite never even giving it prior to this. So, I am just going to ride this into obscurity and let them fire me if need be.\nHowever, having a pleasant attitude on the way out sounds nice. 😎', a user said: 'Just remember it’s about temporarily keeping your job and making money.  Also remember that you are not your job.  Work on yourself and the things you love outside the place.  Find rewarding hobbies and get whatever exercise you can.  Put your mental health first.  Good luck!'",
        "In response to 'Valuable lessons here!\nWere you able to be OK with being a nobody overnight? Or was it a process until you became this person? Does this mean you stopped growing and learning?', a user said: 'No it’s crazy tough.  I was most likely just like you.  There were a number of habits and automatic psychological responses that I had to work on.  You don’t change your core personality overnight.  But slowly you realize that perfectionism isn’t worth it, especially if it’s not achieving the expected result (recognition).\nLuckily my job is pretty good for ongoing learning.  I just don’t need to be the best.  Because I’m actively pumping my co workers tires, I have a better, less stressful relationship with them and there’s more teamwork if you can imagine.  My immediate boss still really respects me (because I’m a skilled worker and difficult to replace) despite my reduced production and overtime.  There’s a tendency to think that everyone is laser focused on your activity, but most of my managers really have no idea what I do there and probably didn’t even understand how hard I was working lol.  So as long as I’m pleasant to deal with and do my job at an acceptable level, I can coast on reputation.'"
