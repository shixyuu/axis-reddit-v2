        "In response to 'Original Post: MacDonald: 'Quiet quitting'? No, it's just work-to-rule — and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'It's tang ping (\"Laying flat\") making its way to the West from China. I'm just waiting for bai lan to get here (\"Letting it rot\"), which is far more destructive to economies. Given the delay of the former, I'd guess we're a year or so away from the latter becoming a widespread thing in these parts.'",
        "In response to 'Young people around the world are expressing  that they don’t see the point in working because you can’t afford anything with work anymore. Asian have the “lay flat” (tang ping) movement and I guess westerners have the quiet quitting. It’s just not worth the effort. Housing is out of reach, food is getting too expensive and wages aren’t keeping up with anything.', a user said: 'Yup, and just wait until the \"Letting it rot\" movement starts spreading where things go from not trying to actively leaning into the situation in such a way that it accelerates its demise. A shift from apathy and tuning out to resentment and destruction.'",
        "In response to 'I guess when Canada becomes so shitty that recent immigrants start doing a 180 when they realize they'll always be poor and starving here.', a user said: 'We may already be there. More and more immigrants are realizing they've been hit with a bait and switch, and are working on their exit strategies. The bigger question is when will word get to their home countries as to what is happening and people their stop believing the hype and begin to avoid Canada.'"
