        "In response to 'Hard to do captions over mobile for you but here's the jist of what she's saying:\nThis lady is a leadership coach for high level management. She was asked if quiet quitting and the great resignation was going to go away. She said it's not this time. The reasons she states are as follows; our labor force has drastically changed. We are far more educated, minimum job requirements push for university degrees over high school and GED certification now in days so we are much smarter than before. We have access to far more information on a global scale than ever before, no limitations to our experience in communication and education, even language doesn't stop us. We have the desire to be more involved in the global community beyond what any other workforce has seen. And lastly we have far more courage than other laborforces, having come from the other side of three years of unprecedented disaster that won't go away.\nShe does not mention the poverty line not having moved in 20 years nor that we know we are not being paid our fair share that is equal to our labor value and the cost of living. She never mentioned money.', a user said: 'Sincerely, thanks for that mate.'"
