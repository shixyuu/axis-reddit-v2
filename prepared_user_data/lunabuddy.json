        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'In my country it is called \"work to rule\" and it's a form of industrial action that if all workers do  collectively, should result in negotiations for higher wages. But doing work beyond what you are being paid for is also something people should collectively not do, in terms of stuff outside your span of hours and your job description. Doing that and being expected to do that is a form of wage theft and often results in people not getting promoted because the company has no incentive to do so, or even create those roles in the first place.'"
