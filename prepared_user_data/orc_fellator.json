        "In response to 'While I recognize that some companies are very bad at rewarding work (especially in the US), it's baffling to see so many people on Reddit complaining about being paid close to minimum wage while also supporting \"quiet quitting\" and putting minimal effort in their job', a user said: 'It depends on the company, truly. My latest job? Your reward for being extra responsible was just more work for no extra pay.  Your list of \"good job, now this has to be done\nevery time\n...\" just gets bigger.\nNo one cared or realized how much work you actually did in your position, our team was actually one of the fastest amongst similar stores at what we did but management still complained that \"we should just be faster\" whenever a minor problem cropped up or pointed out that task x took too long, we wouldn't be able to do it.\nManagement would train you to do certain tasks\nof theirs\nso you could do them, for no extra pay, if you let them. And even then pay rates for the promotions themselves were also shite, not really worth it compared to a job hop.\nIt really is an important skill, to be able to read the room. Learn where you're actually valued, and where you're not. In the former, then pick up some extra tasks and make yourself irreplaceable. In the latter, act your wage and do nothing extra because you'll never, ever be compensated for it.'"
