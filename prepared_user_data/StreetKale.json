        "In response to 'Yup. Because you become too important as a contributor that it becomes hard to move you out of your role cuz while busting your ass turns out you do the work of 3 people, lol.', a user said: 'This hits close to home. I'm not OE but I'm interested in it. I've been in the same role for 15 years without so much as a title change, despite complaining about it 5 years ago. The only upside is that my job is easy. They give me a raise every year but I'm still underpaid in the job market for my skill set. We're supposed to have 4 devs but we only have 2. Why? Because I do the work of 3 people. Instead of promoting me, they just decided to save money and have fewer devs on staff.'",
        "In response to 'Sadly that is how smart business works. Just start slowing down and build evidence you need more people and then start advocating to lead the team of new devs especially since you should be interviewing them anyway as you understand the job the best.', a user said: 'It's only smart until the person doing 3 jobs leaves.'"
