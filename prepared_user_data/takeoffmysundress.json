Wages have stagnated for too long, the cost of living keeps going up, and I'm expected to work harder and faster to make your shareholders more $$$$ while I take a pay cut every year.\nI saw my parents struggle and get sh*t on for their loyalty and hard work. I know what to expect.\nSo yeah, no thanks. You're getting what you pay for.\nI dunno what the solution is, but I don't care. I value my time way more than I value the literal pittance thats provided.\nBetter start getting more TFWs Canadian businesses :p', a user said: 'Previous generations saw that dealing with this bullshit afforded them a house and a vacation every year. That’s not the reality anymore, so what’s the point? Companies cannot remove all incentives and then expect their workers output to surpass 100%. They are very very lucky to get 100% right now.'",
        "In response to 'You make a very good point!!\nMy grand parents with their 3 grade « diplomas » managed to buy a house, have 2 cars, raise 2 kids, travel and enjoy early retirement.\nI have a master’s degree, no kid and no house cause I « missed the housing market timing »', a user said: 'Sounds like insanity to me.'"
