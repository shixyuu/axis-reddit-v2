We have the lowest unemployment rate in the country, in history.\nWe should be able to get a better work life balance out of employers when the supply/demand for labor is what it is.\nThe thing about the whole \"quiet quitting\" shit is this is really just capitalism.\nWorkers have more freedom when their labor is in demand. This is part of economics. When companies need workers. Workers have more of an upper hand in these things. If people were desperate to work, companies could be a lot more strict on selective.\nThis is just economics at play here.'"
