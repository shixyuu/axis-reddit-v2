        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Update: wow, the support!  Thank you all!\nWill now only refer to this as \"Just doing my job\"\nStarting today, I quit working for free.  I won't manage the school food pantry, sew for students or school programs ( uniform alterations, letter jackets, CTE jackets, prom dresses), work the gate or track meets, cover hall duty for others, support fundraisers, sponsor or coach teams, provide snacks to students, participate in staff potluck meals.\n I will arrive 2 minutes before my designated duty time and leave 2 minutes after hours.\nI will take off every Friday to help my family, and take off every PD because I have yet to attend a worthwhile PD (I have only been teaching since 2001, a valuable PD is unlikely to occur in the next year).\nI have 80+ days of leave accrued, and I will leave as few on the table as possible. \nThere is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.', a user said: 'Is your accrued leave personal days or sick days? If they’re personal days, by taking them you are working to rule and that’s cool. If they’re sick days you’re abusing sick time not to mention letting down your students.'",
        "In response to 'According to the HR person, \"they are your days\".', a user said: 'Sounds fair to use them then. Enjoy your days off.'",
        "In response to 'If she’s taking off Friday’s, she may have to use sick days. Some districts don’t let you take personal days on Friday or Monday due to sub shortages most common these days. Different for everyone. :)', a user said: 'She said they’re unrestricted days so it sounds like it’s cool to use them.\nThe shortage is even more reason not to use sick days when you aren’t sick.\nYears ago a newspaper did a big story about abuse of sick time in my old district. They particularly focused on Fridays off and somehow they got hold of records for individual teachers. Some of my friends were names in the story and there was a photo in the paper at the mall on a day she called out sick. They even talked to high school kids who said teachers never showed up on Fridays so it was like a free for all in the auditorium where they sent kids when there weren’t enough subs. (They we’re right. It was nuts.) The whole town was pissed that people we using their sick days even though they were days we earned. After that the next contract reduced the number of sick days to the state minimum and had new rules about doctor notes.'"
