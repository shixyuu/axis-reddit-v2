        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'I don't really understand the term tbh. It seems like doing your job within paid hours is now called quiet quitting, if I'm understanding right.\nThis idea of staying late because your employers refuse to hire more people to do the job is toxic and needs to stop. If your staff can't get the work done in the time they're employed, hire more staff, and if you can't hire more staff then you should scale back until you can.'"
