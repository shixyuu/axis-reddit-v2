[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0xvxv41m8axc1.png', a user said: 'I talked with my dad about this recently, heâ€™s a white collar business owner (small business though, mind you). He tells me all the time about the differences in work culture, ability, and skills that he sees in the different generations.\nTheres definitely an element of millenials and now Gen Z that they are just more efficient, more worldly, and more health conscious which means they often look less efficient than other groups but are much more efficient in actuality.\nWe basically got the skills, but none of the old-school attitude.'"
