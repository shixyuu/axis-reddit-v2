        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is such a corpo bs term. When you buy 1kg of rice, you pay 1kg peso worth of money. If the vendor decides to give you extra kg, then that's called a promo. Now when employees give services for what they're paid for, they call it quiet quitting?\nEh, just call it \"quielty doing your job\". Any extra is just a promo and should not be expected as a norm.', a user said: 'siguro kaya yan yung term for people na nag ooverwork to get noticed. hahaha. i remember when i saw that term on my feed sa tiktok, parang lahat sila similar ng story: they overwork pero di narerecognize ganun.\nwhen i finally got my first job, parang ang fulfilling kasi ang bait ng supervisor namin. in fact, ayaw niya kaming nagwowork beyond office hours. i then told my sister about it. sabi niya \"okay?\" and i was in disbelief kasi i always had this perception na every boss is just... shit? hahahah kaya parang narealize ko i can just... finally do the bare minimum in something hahahaha college fucked me up mentally.\nanyways, idk why nagkwento lang ako pero ayun i just hope na to any undergrad, sana wag too pressured to get up the ladder too much and maybe just breathe ganun. pero that's just me.'"
