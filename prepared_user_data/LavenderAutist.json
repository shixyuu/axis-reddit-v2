        "In response to 'Original Post: I got promoted while quiet quiting My j1 is boring and has a lot of meetings, so I decided to quit and search for a new J, that was months ago. I accepted j3 and for the last 3 months I did a total of 0 commits, I just go to meetings and pretend I do some shit\nI just got off my 1:1 with my manager, and got promoted to senior backend dev. I will get a raise of 15%\nLife is funny sometimes', a user said: 'Promoting you might be a way to fire you'",
        "In response to 'How would that happen? Just curious how HR would do that.\nIt's like raise, more expectations, and then having more reasons to fire?', a user said: 'Step one: Promote someone to their level of incompetence\nStep two: Watch them fail at their job\nStep three: Put them on PIP. Lay them off. Or fire them.\nOP clearly doesn't want further responsibility. But now they have been promoted. Which means more responsibility and more visibility in the organization.\nVisibility in terms of how much they make and how much the company could save in headcount.\nMore visibility with counterparts and direct reports.\nAnd even if their boss loves them, their boss could get moved to another group or laid off or there could be a reorganization underneath a different manager in the same group.\nAnd all of those things increase the possibility of getting let go or forced to work more than OP wants.\nI think others understand what I am saying since the original comment was upvoted so much.\nIf you want to OE, it's often better to have an individual contributor role at a lower level than a 15% pay bump because you can more easily OE multiple jobs. Two or three jobs at 100% pay is better than one job at 115% of pay.'",
        "In response to 'I think you’re overthinking this a little lol.', a user said: 'Cool bro. Thanks for playing.\nI can see you're still new to this game.'",
        "In response to 'Yes I learned what you said the hard way. People don’t know until it happens to them. So I can back up what you say.', a user said: 'Sorry to hear that\nWishing you the best'",
        "In response to 'As someone who has been managing a long time, had to fire people, and deal with tons of random HR shit....this feels like a way to just take the usual ways of getting rid of people and making it take 4 times as long. Promoting someone and then putting them on a pip would take ages with most HRs. You would have to extend documentation of failure so much longer and it would just make you look bad by saying you promoted someone that shouldnt have been.', a user said: 'I didn't say place them on PIP.\nI said one of the three.\nI have no idea about OP's situation.\nI don't know his company or manager or their culture or any of that.\nBut in some companies you have to do some BS to get rid of an employee and keep budget.\nOr you have to play games to promote someone so that you can let them go later when it's time to give up one of your staff to budget cuts.\nThe person asked for clarification on why a promotion could be a set up by management to let them go. So I gave them just a lot of random ideas.\nWithout any more information, I couldn't tell what's happening in OP's situation. But it is odd that he gets a random promotion without doing anything. Not saying it isn't possible, but at most companies it isn't probable. And giving someone more responsibility is an easy way to get them out on performance rather than cutting a headcount or position.'",
        "In response to 'A pip is usually required for firing less there is gross negligence which generally makes the manager also look bad. Lay offs are not simple things to plan around and you generally don't get backfill for a lay off meaning getting rid of higher level positions is worse if it's even the managers decision who to lay off.', a user said: 'It all depends on the company\nWe don't have enough information'",
        "In response to 'No you’re correct in my situation it actually happened to me in my previous job.  My dad who was a HR manager told me this happens. My previous job in the same company I performed very well. Got promoted and was being great reviews, then they started giving me things to do that was out of my job description and then I couldn’t do anything right. Then I was let go after 10 years.  I was so stressed that year. I literally had 3 attorneys I worked for. Now I work for a smaller company doing HR work and most days barely lift a finger. I don’t earn nearly as much as I did for that big company, but I’m permanently remote and i love it. No micromanagement and I’m perceived to be a high performer. Not bragging because it took me a lot to get here. Unfortunately, many are right. In this current company I had to learn the hard way. I was underpaid more than anyone, but I worked the hardest. I even worked two departments and I was not appreciated. It became toxic for me, then Covid happened, they removed the manager that was giving me problems, they sold the office building we commuted to, I asked to go back to my old department in this new job and now I get to walk a few steps to my job every morning at home lol. I get all my work done by 10 every morning and bs the rest of the day lol. I been at this current job for 7 years. The last 2 have been bliss.', a user said: 'Congratulations on getting to a great spot'",
        "In response to 'That sounds like a lot of work to just fire someone.  I don’t know the rules in every state but my understanding is in right to work states (where I live) they can fire you if they don’t like the cut of your gib that day', a user said: 'It's not just about the legal reasons. There are internal politics as well with headcount and budget and things like that. Especially during hiring freezes.\nAgain we don't know OP's company nor situation.'"
