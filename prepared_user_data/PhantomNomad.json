        "In response to 'Thanks for this response. A lot can be learned from the older generations and can also be very helpful. It can’t be one way. That’s where I think the disconnect is. Older generations really need to listen and work towards a mutually beneficial solution.', a user said: 'My old boss when I started would always say she wanted new ideas on how to improve processes and such.  But when you presented something, not only would she shoot it down, she would get mad that you are wasting time instead of \"doing your job\".  So glad she retired.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah and depending on your job you can do the math and see how bad you’re getting squeezed. I just left a job, there were 5 employees and the owner was making 3-5mil in profit per year, I was making 19.50 hourly, but before last year it was 17. I did all of the production, it was a couple sales people and warehouse workers. Sales guys got paid, rest of us got raped.', a user said: 'Just like most places, sales make money so they get paid.  Everyone else is 100% pure expense and isn't worth a dime.'",
        "In response to 'We pretend to work. They pretend to pay us… 😞', a user said: 'Isn't that what they said in the Soviet Union?'",
        "In response to 'Kevin O’Leary would want 25 hours of work in a day. Absolutely bewildering how entitled some CEOs are. Not sure in what type of world they live into. Government has also slipped into the “do more with less” and “we need to be more like the private sector”. It is bad everywhere.', a user said: 'O'Leary is a huge piece of shit and I don't know why anyone would want to work for him.  Sure a few of the upper management would because they make more in one day then I do all year.  But everyone else below should just on mass quit and watch it all come apart.'"
