        "In response to 'Original Post: \"Quiet Quitting\" is henceforth returned to \"Working to Rule\". [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/zyuip9dwb68a1.png', a user said: 'One day you go “above and beyond”, maybe you like the person you’re “going the extra mile” for, or you genuinely want to take the extra care and attention in that moment.\nThe next indefinite period of days this becomes the bare minimum expected of you and anything less than this ever increasing level of expectation is “cause for concern”. Every day you strive to achieve these expectations, you get two days closer to death, until performing the impossible becomes the new expectation. And all this without even a mention of commensurate compensation.'"
