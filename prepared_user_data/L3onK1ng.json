Some people will smell the bullshit, so you add horseshit, goatshit, dogshit and enough of other types of crap so that we all are left unable to smell it.\nIn other words, there's enough types of diversion and propoganda for every type of people. With the introduction of algorithms, we have that crap specifically tailored for our biases and personalities, so we are less and less protected by our own thinking.'"
