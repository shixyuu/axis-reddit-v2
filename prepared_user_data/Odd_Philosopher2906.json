        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'I had a meltdown that meal planning weekly and then listening to people complain about what I picked without help made me want to burn our house down.  So my husband made a group meal planning note and shared it with everyone and told them if the day was empty they were fending for themselves.  One night of me not cooking dinner because nothing was planned has totally turned everything around.  My husband has fully taken on meal planning and getting the kids involved in planning AND cooking.  I just get groceries, which I'm totally fine with.'"
