The topic before this one parrots the idea of \"millennials and Gen-Z increasingly hate working from home!\"\nSaw a WSJ one today about media conglomerates worried about customers leaving streaming plans freely after a month instead of being tied down to fixed terms like cable used to lock you in. Translation: \"we want to eliminate this freedom.\"', a user said: 'Jesus Christ, we’re not doing cable again goddamn it!'",
        "In response to 'We're already doing cable again. At one time the big problem was cable companies bundling the one chanel you wanted with 23 junk channels (and usually 2 or 3 yet another shopping channels) and charging for all 23 rather than offering alacarte.\nThen streaming services came about offering everything for less than the cable company charged and without commercials.\nNow we have an ever growing number of streaming services offering an ever shrinking catalog of shows (as a bundle). And commercials have gotten back in as well though (for now) you can pay extra to avoid them.\nSo the big change is that now instead of adding package XYZ for that one channel you want it's adding streaming service XYZ for that one show you want.', a user said: 'Honestly, you’re not wrong. The locked contracts would kinda just be the cherry on top as an industry practice.\nEdit: capitalism breeds innovation! /s'"
