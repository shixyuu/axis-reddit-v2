        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'I have some friends who worked in Korean and Japanese corporate offices. People were often in well before 8am, and left after their boss did, which could be an easy 7pm.\nMy friends guessed that mixed into that 12+ hour day was about 3 hours of work, tops. Lots of eating, lunching, newspapers (probably now phone surfing), etc.\nI have another friend who went to a 4 day workweek at his robotics company. Productivity went up. He went to a 6 hour day, and productivity (per week) remained the same; but happiness went way up. At 6 hours 4 days, people don't have a whole lot of time for any BS. They do their work, they get out.\nAnother modern workplace problem is exemplified by the soviet worker saying, \"I'll pretend to work, while you pretend to pay me.\"\nWhile these are anecdotal, there are a pile of studies showing shorter work days work out like above, as does a 4 day work week. But, many companies get this wrong. One company I know of tried a 4 day work week, but still expected not only 40 hours, so 10 hour days, but the managers then started pestering the workers to come in 5 days instead of \"goofing off\" while their projects fell behind. So, 5 10 hour days. \"Oh, and it would be great if you could do what it takes to have this ready by Monday.\"'"
