Just because you are great at (job) does not mean for a moment that you are good at managing (ether/all of time, budget, humans)', a user said: '“Management” as conceptually understand by our culture today only emerged after WW2. From the operation planning of 4 star General Omar Bradley. He revolutionized the concept to what we understand today.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Where Are the Workers? From Great Resignation to Quiet Quitting [External Link]: https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2023/09/27/where-are-the-workers-from-great-resignation-to-quiet-quitting', a user said: 'USA capital destroyed the system of indirect welfare to subsidize education while they didn’t replace that system. The USA doesn’t have a labor shortage. The USA has lack of investment capital into labor.'",
        "In response to 'A labour shortage due to a lack of investment capital into labour is still a labour shortage.', a user said: 'False. If your business requires a commodity and you don’t invest into that commodity, it’s just poor management.\nShortages imply factor outside of your own control. This isn’t that. It’s a result of extremist capitalist ideology, a long know contradiction of capitalism.'"
