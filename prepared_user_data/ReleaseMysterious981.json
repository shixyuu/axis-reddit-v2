        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'Well if you work at B&M, you sign a contract for 20 but you'll be set 32, 40, 24 hours\nI signed a 12hr contract and was given 20,then 40 like mf your hot, shitty store is already giving me dehydration headaches and my piss looks like lager, you can shove your \"overtime is encouraged\".\nShitty work, shitty first job, shitty management, lovely colleagues :)'"
