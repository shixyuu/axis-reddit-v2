        "In response to 'It's a phrase I only know thanks to The Boondocks, and it refers to the N***** Itis, which I absolutely didn't know at the time as the full phrase, but I think that was the shows intent. Its a phrase from the days of slavery in the US, used to describe why your slaves were \"slow and lazy,\" that persisted into Jim Crow, and most general racism.\nIt has applications across all of history and even today, why work hard when you'll never rise above your stature or class? A question ancient peasants were smart enough to ask. Do just enough to get by, no more. The recent propaganda of the American Dream is just that, and meant to benefit a select few.', a user said: 'Unfortunately, the actual reason the slaves were \"slow and lazy \" is likely due to rampant hookworm infections in the American South. It's the same reason Southerners in general were seen as unproductive compared to Northerners who didn't have to deal with hookworms. You can read about it on PBS\nHow A Worm Gave The South A Bad Name'"
