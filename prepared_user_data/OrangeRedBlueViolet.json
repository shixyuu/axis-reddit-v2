[External Link]: https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ramaswamy-2024-presidential-election-campaign-rcna131919', a user said: 'He’s ending his book tour/audition for a role in a republican administration as he planned from the beginning.\nActually what it feels like is someone trying to capture a market.
