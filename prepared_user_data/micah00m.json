        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Regardles of the term, I've been practicing this since I started in my current work. I dont do anything extra or get out of my way to do something that I'm not assigned to do. When I become overwhelmed with so many things to do, I take it one task at a time.\nBefore, I used to think that I'll be rewarded with hard work, knowing how to do extra tasks, helping other dept - but all of those weren't rewarded even if everybody knew that I was good. The people who got extra raises are those close to the boss.'"
