        "In response to 'You talk about how the employer-employee relationship must be mutually beneficial, but “Quiet Quitting”, aka doing the minimum amount of work to not be fired, is neither beneficial to you nor your employer.\nIf you don’t feel you are earning your worth as an employee, then tell your employer that you wish to be compensated or you will quit.  If they don’t compensate you, quit and join another company.   If you can’t be hired to earn more at another company, and/or if your employer doesn’t care if you quit, then you’re not worth much as an employee, so you don’t have a strong case for asking for more compensation.\nIf you’re not worth much as an employee, then putting in the minimum amount to not get fired definitely won’t increase your worth.  You could be putting your income at risk: if the company downsizes then you’ll be first on the chopping block.', a user said: '“Quiet Quitting”, aka doing the minimum amount of work to not be fired, is neither beneficial to you nor your employer.\nHow is it not beneficial to the employee to work less (or to the extent defined in their job description and no more)? Same money, less work is a win to me. Your only defense seems to be that\nsomeday\nyou\nmight\nget downsized. But that's always true and it's dependent on a million factors.\nPlus if they took your advice and got a new job that paid better, that would make them the newest hire at a higher wage and very likely to be laid off if the need arose.'",
        "In response to 'Same money, less work is a win to me.\nDoing the minimum amount of work to not be fired isn't \"less work\", because it requires other people to pick up your slack.  It's more work in the long run.  For example, it would be silly to leave work exactly at the second you're supposed to clock out, leaving a task 90% finished, which you or a coworker would then have to restart from the beginning tomorrow morning.\nPlus, you'd hate for it to go the other way: Bosses forcing you to clock out when you go to the bathroom.  It shouldn't be about nickel and dime-ing each other out of as much pay/labour as possible.  It should be about working together to do the work as effectively as possible. Yes, being paid fairly is a big part of that.', a user said: 'Doing the minimum amount of work to not be fired isn't \"less work\", because it requires other people to pick up your slack.

Why should an employee care if the business didn't hire enough employees to do their jobs as described in their contracts/job descriptions? Why do I need to stay late every day to get that other 10% done to avoid them paying another person to do it? That's literally not my problem—I'm not here to subsidize their business.\nPlus, you'd hate for it to go the other way: Bosses forcing you to clock out when you go to the bathroom.\nMany employers do this kind of thing. These are exactly the companies where quiet quitting should occur.\nIt shouldn't be about nickel and dime-ing each other out of as much pay/labour as possible.\nYou just described capitalism.\nIt should be about working together to do the work as effectively as possible. Yes, being paid fairly is a big part of that.\nI currently have a job with a socially important organization with lots of freedom and flexibility and therefore I am willing to put in the extra mile for them. Quiet quitting isn't for\neveryone\n, it's for people who are in situations where they are being taken advantage of.\nMost\ncompanies should absolutely be nickel and dimed—they are not your friend.'"
