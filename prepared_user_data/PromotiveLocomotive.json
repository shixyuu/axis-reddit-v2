        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'It should be the norm if you are paid by the hour, or are not incentivized to complete the job quickly. If you want people to work hard, pay them for the job not the time, i.e contracting. That way they are incentivized to work harder and complete the job quickly. Jobs these days seem to give good workers more work/responsibilities without opportunities of getting a promotion/raise. Especially common in corporate jobs. Essentially you are punishing hard workers with more work for no additional pay. This pattern incentivizes people to do the bare minumum.'"
