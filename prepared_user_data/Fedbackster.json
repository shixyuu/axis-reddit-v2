        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'American students don’t have to quiet quit.  It’s become acceptable for students to do no work for years now.  Parents and administrators don’t care or are too lazy to address it.  Nothing quiet about it.'"
