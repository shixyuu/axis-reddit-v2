        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'Yes, got RTOd last month. Show up at 10am, go get some coffee and walk around the building for an hour, sit down and work for an hour, take an hour lunch break, go to the in office shitty gym treadmill for an hour, walk around for 30 minutes, work kinda hard for ~1-2 hours and leave between 3:30 and 4:30. It’s not perfect but I get my steps in and feel like I’m am at least partially sticking it to the man or woman in the case of my shitty boss. They definitely get about 2 hours less work out of me per day and I managed to dodge the round of layoffs that just hit yesterday. It’s obvious that they are just sorting salary by amount in a spreadsheet (that they barely understand how to use) and firing those on the top of the expendable list. Unfortunately they are getting close to where I’m at. We shall see……'",
