        "In response to 'Has anyone here ever worked somewhere, had a supervisor quit, then had to do the supervisor's job, but while being told they can't actually make you officially the supervisor yet, just so they don't have to give you a pay rise? I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'Yes for like 6 months. Then a new supervisor started and since she didn’t know what to do I had to do her job too and train her to supervise me.\nThen I taught her how to use our payroll system. She saw how little I made and tried to get me a raise. When she couldn’t she realized she needs to do her own job because she literally did nothing all day and made 3x as much as me while I was struggling to live paycheck to paycheck and was slammed with work everyday including about 200 emails each morning. We ended up dividing up my tasks so that she had way more to do than me.\nI still quit when I found something that paid better. Eventually she became a decent supervisor but I couldn’t afford to live working for that place.'"
