        "In response to 'Or how gaining minutes or hours back\nThis is it. This is the missing link for me. Rich execs have maids, order whatever food they want or have someone cook it for them (a chef or stay at home spouse), have private drivers, 24/7 live-in nannies. Assistants to do basically whatever you need them to do. They're healthier because they can afford to be, so very few sick days.\nWhen you have that much money, you can easily buy your time back. So why wouldn't you want to come to the office? It's like it's FUN for these people. A fun, social time.', a user said: 'The loss of 2 hours of my Monday alone adds noticeable stress to my life. It means that in order to get the grocery shopping done for the week I have to rush and still get to the store later when it is busier so that grocery shopping takes more time and mental energy.\nIt also means I then have to go straight from work to shopping to preparing dinner. No down time from 6 am when I wake up to 7 pm after dinner is eaten. Every Monday. When I was working remotely, I got an hour more sleep, got to do grocery shopping either over lunch or before everyone else was off work, got a little afternoon time before preparing meals.\nThat's just Monday.'",
        "In response to 'I prefer the phrase \"setting proper boundaries\" rather than \"quiet quitting.\" No one but the employer benefits if extra work or accommodations are given by the employee. Its well past the time that those boundaries are clarified - if you want more work, you get more pay, time off or bonuses. Period.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting really sounds like an employer-centric implicitly threatening term to make having boundaries seem scary.\nIn reality, we got nip this shit and take our power back.'"
