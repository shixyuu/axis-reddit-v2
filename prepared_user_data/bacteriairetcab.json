        "In response to 'She's a low-to-mid charisma coastal lawyer bureaucrat who skipped straight to Washington insider without any voter approval at any point in the process. I know we like to pretend it's all racism and sexism (which don't help), but I saw her bomb speaking in a room full of African-American women--lead balloon reception compared to Booker, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, every other candidate, etc... None of those people would be my first pick and they still massively outperformed her in an environment we can't make any of the usual excuses. Every time my friends in the rustbelt watched her in ads or speeches, I'd hear words like \"condescending\" and \"lecturing\". And this is from mostly apolitical people who lean Dem.\nShe'd be 64 in 2028 (she's only a little younger than Obama now and he ran 16 years ago) campaigning to be a 72-year-old president at a time everyone is sick of retirees running national politics. It's like she combines the worst traits of Al Gore, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton. This is not the sort of candidate we have\never\nwon with even before we forced her down people's throats without giving them any say.\nAnyone thinking she ever had it never had their finger on the pulse. Anyone seriously suggesting we run her again should never try to offer political advice except on opposite day.', a user said: 'No one can honestly look at this last campaign and say she has low charisma. She’s definitely got Obama level charisma but we all want to pretend “oh sexism and racism aren’t a thing anymore”. From her debate to her podcast interviews to her SNL appearance - her charisma is top notch. A lack of charisma is not why she lost, but her strong charisma is why she’ll be hard to beat in a primary for the president or California'",
        "In response to 'No one can honestly look at this last campaign and say she has low charisma.\nShe has low charisma. She didn't come off as natural and she was stilted. There's a reason she didn't get traction in 2019. And since you took it there, she's nowhere near the best female nonwhite speaker in our party. Biden and team picked a near-last-place showing candidate voters were widely disinterested in and who would've probably never come any further on the national stage. I think she did...maybe a little better than we could've feared given that setup for a sudden handoff. But there's a reason so many people, including me, wanted to at least have a serious conversation about an open primary over running the very substandard candidate we had been handed like it was gospel. It wasn't because we liked our odds in an open primary. It was because we thought our odds were\nso\nbad with Harris that it might be worth the gamble.\nBarack Obama was a fantastic speaker. Michelle Obama is a much better speaker than her husband but doesn't want to go into politics, which is fair. In flat-out speaking ability, Harris is probably in the bottom 25% of the Dem party. She put in a really good effort and did better than most anyone thought she would. But she didn't naturally know the right things to say (e.g. her answer on The View), spoke like a politician the whole time, and just never won people over beyond being the alternative to Trump. I think that's the sentiment we saw in the primaries, the sentiment when she was announced, then she went missing from the public eye most of VP's presidency and...suddenly was the candidate. With no more momentum than when she left off. She got a slight upsurge from not being Biden because people were desperate to have a not-Biden candidate. But, as we saw on election night, she just didn't have it.\nI don't know why we're pretending she was some gold-plated 10/10 candidate. Again, there's a reason she never caught on in the primaries when voters had their say, and that doesn't change by turning a spotlight on her and maximizing visibility.', a user said: 'I don’t know why you’re pretending that she had low charisma, she objectively didn’t. You’re telling me the person in these videos had low charisma:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4N1VGw/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4L3qnr/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4LouPk/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4NMNjo/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4LEXMe/\nLike there’s a lot you can criticize her for, but lack charisma isn’t one. I get that maybe you fell for the propaganda or bias, but if you actually scrutinize her when she’s out in public she’s just objectively genuine and charismatic. Like I honestly don’t see how anyone not coming from bias could say otherwise when it’s so obvious to someone with eyes.\nPoint to other politicians that produce content like this - it’s Obama, Trump and Harris. Could add AOC to that list. I’ve yet to find someone that was actually willing to say this is mid tier politicking you see from other candidates - it’s not.\nBarack Obama was a fantastic speaker. Michelle Obama is a much better speaker than her husband but doesn’t want to go into politics, which is fair. In flat-out speaking ability, Harris is probably in the bottom 25% of the Dem party.\nHarris literally had the second best speech at the DNC, after Michelle. Stop with this nonsense.\nShe did phenomenal and she ran a historic campaign because she’s historically talented. That doesn’t mean she should run in 2028, but we need to be honest. Obama’s got it. Trumps got it. Harris has it. She lost because she ran against someone who had it, not because she lacked it. Any other boilerplate Republican she would have beat.'",
        "In response to 'On whether Harris should run in 2028: please do not rehabilitate her.\nThe campaign itself was ok, but let's be honest, she was a bad candidate. She got asked on the view whether she would have done anything differently than an 81 year old man with 32% approval, and she couldn't think of a single thing! Why not say Gaza, or that the cost of housing would be more of a priority or something\nHer 2019 primary was also a disaster. And in 49/50 states we lost ground. CA governor? Sure, why not. But please not president, she would lose by even more in 2028. Americans want outsiders, not the ultimate insider.', a user said: 'Let’s be honest, she was an objectively good candidate and did pretty well considering the hand she was given. Insisting that she’s a bad candidate just because she didn’t want to distance herself from her own administration is an odd take…\nIt’s clear the pod bros don’t want her to run and I suspect they worry she’d probably easily win the primary. They pretty clearly all agreed she’d easily win the nomination for governor, highlighting they aren’t in the same brain dead camp as this subreddit where most seem to think that voters have ditched her (they haven’t). I’d bet they worry she’d have a tough time winning the general and don’t won’t her to put the party in that position if she ran since she’d have a strong chance of winning the primary.'"
