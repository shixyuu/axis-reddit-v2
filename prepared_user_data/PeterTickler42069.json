        "In response to 'Recently, I had a check in with my team lead related to my performance and he outlined that I log off early for the day as he sees me offline at 7 or 8 pm, and I told him that my work shift is from 9 am till 6 pm and guess what his response was. He told me to stretch out my work day to be available for anyone wanting to contact me till at least 10 pm, while only filling out 9 hours in the daily timesheet. All this bullshit about going above and beyond should stop, and since I am selling hours of my lifetime to the company for a shit pay, I will not give any more hours than agreed upon for the shit pay just because a daydreaming lunatic asshole is asking me to do so.', a user said: 'This is a big deal at my gfs work, some of her co-workers start as much as 3 hours early and will stay well beyond their scheduled work hours. Her work hours are 8-4 and they expect her to work late because her co-workers do.\nI told her you're salary, work your hours get your work done, if you can't get it done in the time they've given you they need to hire and you need to tell them that. Every hour you work beyond your designated shift is a step closer to minimum wage and in some cases lower than minimum wage.'"
