I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'I wfh and enjoy being productive and earning my pay.  I'm a VA and have to record time worked to bill clients properly.  If I take time off to put the laundry in or water my plants, I have to shut the clock off.  I don't mind. The pay is great. And I appreciate the convenience and flexibility of hours and wfh.  That's what WFH is supposed to be.  Grow up!\nSomeday your company will notice no work product is being produced and you will be fired.  Then what?'",

When your employer starts treating you crappy, they don’t deserve your time and effort while you look for another job.', a user said: 'I put up with a crappy eer for several months and found myself a new job.  Even crappy eer deserved to get my work done.  If he's paying me  he should get something back.  It's the moral thing to do.   I have to live with my conscience. I consider it stealing otherwise.'"
