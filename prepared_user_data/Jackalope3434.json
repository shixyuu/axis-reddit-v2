        "In response to 'I see a lot of posts on a sub like Millennials w ppl lamenting the fact they have no job, the market sucks, they'll never own a house, the system is rigged, etc.\nIt always makes me think of the folks here, 'getting theirs' while there's 'not enough' to go around.\nI mean, yes, rage against the machine, always, but you have to eat.', a user said: 'Thousands upon thousands are getting laid off in the USA right now… now it’s coming down to whether your bag getting bigger or having humanity is more important to you - in the US specifically.\nI think what a lot of OE’rs miss about the form here is doing the work you’re paid for at the minimum to not be an ass and just take a job out of the job pool ONLY for a fraudulent paycheck. I haven’t ratted on two in my own org who I have confirmed are OE because they’re stupidly behaving like it - screwing ME is fine I guess but  fucking over everyone else daily with their crap behavior and not doing any work at all while someone who’d love to have any job at all right now, and healthcare, sits at home crying while filling out applications that are automatically binned by a shit ATS “review” system and taking 18 months to get a role again.'"
