Why kill yourself for a company that  wasn't going to provide the steel rice bowl their fathers received? I don't blame them, employment has felt so precarious in the last 20 years and the wages are shit. It's absurd what many Japanese will work for. In some parts of the world, people won't get out of bed for those salaries.'"
