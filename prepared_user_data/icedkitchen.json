        "In response to 'Original Post: My icing quiet quit ðŸ˜‚ I made some Xmas cookies and took them to moms. I made far too many and brought the rest home. They all survived except the trees. The icing came off in a sheet. Did my icing job just quiet quit? The other cookies are fine. Only the trees did this. All decorated the same day using the same batch of icing. Weird!', a user said: 'Iâ€™m so curious how this happened! You mentioned you did wreaths with this green, too, were those decorated with any other colors (Iâ€™m picturing a circle cookie with a white base and the green wreath on too)?\nThe green looks really rich in color, maybe oversaturated?\nBtw, I love how you decorated these, so cute!'"
