And honestly, work to rule should be the standard! Going above and beyond doesn't usually get you anywhere except for more work.'",
        "In response to 'My cvs is horrible. The poor staff is overwhelmed daily and staff that I knew for years quit to work at other chains making $5 an hour more. Screw that company in particular', a user said: 'I had a family member that worked at CVS although not in the pharmacy section. It was one of the most ridiculous jobs ever! The pharmacy was constantly understaffed, leading to long lines of irritated customers waiting for their meds. The folks that worked the store section never had a regular schedule. You could be closing shift Monday, opening shift Tuesday, mid shift Wednesday, and so on. They didn't pay enough or give enough hours for people to survive on it full time;  but with that kind of schedule it was really hard for folks to get a second job. And they also didn't put the schedule out until the very last minute every time. The entire thing was designed to make all the workers as miserable as possible, and also to guarantee turnover when people quit because it was impossible to have any semblance of a life while working there.'"
