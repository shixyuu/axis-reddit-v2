        "In response to 'It amazes me that people spend money on cable, Netflix, or Hulu. There's so much free stuff. It's not like the old days where everyone watched a show together and you wanted to be able to talk about it (with rare exceptions).

Pretty much any topic you can imagine there’s someone out there making quality content about it for free. YT premium is kinda pricey, but still the best value in streaming when you factor in never having to watch ads (I know there are other ways to get those features for free, but I’m lazy and like watching on my smart tv without jumping through hoops).'"
