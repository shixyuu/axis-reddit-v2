Plus just taking a day off results in a pile up of work so much that it takes me 2 days to catch up for every day I take off.', a user said: 'Staycations are just as good at decompression.\nStop caring about the pile. What your manager has done is put their job onto you. Your workload is clearly unsustainable for one person, so roll back your effort to one person only and force them to reevaluate the needs of your team. Doing extra just compounds the issue.\nSource: been both individual contributor and a manager.'",
        "In response to 'Take more than 1 day.\nIf 1 day off takes you 2 to get caught up, then take a week off.  If that doesn't change your workfload, then take 2 weeks off.  Plan it out well in advance, but this is the only way that your manager is going to actually take steps to move stuff off of your plate, rather than \"just wait until\n/u/No_Plantain_4990\ngets back tomorrow\".', a user said: 'Bingo!'",
        "In response to 'Some companies have really weird cultures that you pick up on for stuff like that. I recall one company I worked at where people\nnever\nleft before 6pm even if you started at 7am. If you did leave “early” you’d get stares from the entire office.', a user said: 'I had this happen to me. They thought I left early everyday because they came in so late. It was so frustrating to know I’d been there for 9.5 hrs when they’d pull maybe 7 hrs. But I was the bad guy because they couldn’t find me at 5pm. The only way to get my work done was when I wasn’t interrupted constantly, which meant I came in two hours earlier than everyone (sometimes four, depending on the person). Fuck ‘em.'"
