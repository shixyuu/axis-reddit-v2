        "In response to 'This is the way to fix a broken system.  “Exploit” for fucks sake.  What I wouldn’t give to have a “normal” work schedule.  Except I don’t bitch about it. Instead of complaining about handing out orange wedges at scholastic sporting events chose a different profession. No one forced you to become teachers.  It’s literally one of the only things you can do with a History degree for example. Unless you can get a job as a curator at a museum you’re pretty limited. Those were your choices. Own them or quit loudly! Every teacher I ever had preached not doing the bare minimum.', a user said: 'As someone with an advanced history degree, you're right, but you're also very very wrong. If you get a BA in History\nand choose to not pursue graduate education\n, you're 100% correct. However, there is hardly any limitation to the potential for advanced degrees in history-adjacent professions. Go international, there are plenty of heritage-related positions. Take that history degree and translate it to governmental administration, or join the literature industry, or become a college/university lecturer. I have a colleague who is a historian on a cruise line who does excursions to archaeological sites and\nmakes bank\nwhile working four months out of the year. My point is that\nyou\nfeel limited by having a history degree, but are only limited by the amount of effort and goals set for yourself.\nDo you teach in a good place where leaders don't demean you? Don't use guilt and shame as a weapon to take your personal time? Don't treat you as a professional and insult your skill? Don't remunerate you sufficiently that as a professional educator you're not living paycheck-to-paycheck? If you're not experiencing these things, I am\nso\nhappy for you, but you need to commiserate or at least be empathetic to those that are experiencing hardships.\nOne day it could happen to you.'"
