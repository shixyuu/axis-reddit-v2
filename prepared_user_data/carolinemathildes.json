        "In response to 'Original Post: Move over, quiet quitting. 'Rage applying' is the latest form of worker revenge | CBC Radio [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/rage-applying-1.6759642', a user said: 'That's just looking for a new job. There's still the old-school idea that you're supposed to get one job and be loyal to them forever and never leave, so they call it \"rage applying\" because it makes it seem like people are doing something wrong or out of the ordinary because they want to work somewhere else. She wanted a new job, so she applied for one and got it. The opposite of a news story.'",
        "In response to 'I don’t disagree with trying to maximize your income. Do you boo-boo and get that paper.\nBut also, the person in the article got ticked her employer hired someone they “weren’t comfortable around”, whatever that means.\nI mean, barring this specific individual having traumatized the existing employee in some way, you need to suck that up.\nPart of being a functioning member of society is learning how to cooperate with people you don’t like.', a user said: 'But why should she have to? She didn't fight or a make a scene. She found a new job, something she's perfectly entitled to do for whatever reason she wants.'"
