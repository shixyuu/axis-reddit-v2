        "In response to 'Original Post: Analysis Shows 'Quiet Fleecing' of US Workers—Not 'Quiet Quitting'—Is the Real Problem | \"Workers are more productive than ever, but their pay hasn't kept pace while top 1% wages have skyrocketed,\" says the Economic Policy Institute. [External Link]: https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/09/09/analysis-shows-quiet-fleecing-us-workers-not-quiet-quitting-real-problem', a user said: 'I've seen too many tiktoks and memes about employees being met for career development or peformance evaluations with managers telling employees the \"little\" extra they need to provide to get to the next level or get that promotion... and then, wouldnt you know it never happens even though the employee delievers and does the work load of two . Too often I've seen and heard about having to learn new skills and taking on new roles at other companies to get any sort of salary increase. Quiet Quitting is exactly what everyone needs and should be doing, they got everyone hypnotized and bamboozled about what they should be doing to move forward. \"This business is a family\" is another one of those red flags you hear about in interviews.'"
