        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'Quiet quit the next job, and the job after that. It's just how I work now. I'll do what I have to do to do my job and if I can get it done in 20 hours I spend the rest of the time watching movies, tv, reading, being creative, learning stuff I'm interested in.\nOver the years the only thing that's different is I feel less guilty about it. Opportunities have come up for progression and promotion and management opportunities but I'm not doing it. Not worth it. I'm not taking on more hours and more responsibility for an extra 30-40K a year.'"
