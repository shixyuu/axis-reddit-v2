        "In response to 'Original Post: SPE quiet quitting I never thought quiet quitting could be so detrimental to an organization.\nMy spe went from being a superstar spe in the workgroup to nobody home. He was involved in a ton of projects and was well respected by probationary examiners.\nHis out of office teams status message used to be a mile long with many alternative POCs for his projects ... now its like \"off till monday, no phone/email access, contact any workgroup spe\".\nJunior examiner actions get zero feedback and are quickly signed.\nYet morale is high and smiles all around, right?', a user said: 'Short sighted idiot leadership at its finest. There is no doubt that SPEs got mega-shafted. Good luck getting any Examiners to become a sup when we all see how you've treated them'",
        "In response to 'Some of the ip law subs are starting to get back ridiculous rejections, but they haven’t put 2 and 2 together yet. My experience is that when you’re deep in a fire you need your friends to hose you down, even from polluted waters. It’s a crazy time but we have to figure out how to survive this together. My time with the corporate world also taught me that you have to give them exactly what they want until they beg you to stop.', a user said: 'Word, but the goop being rushed out is going to catch up w the examiners, esp juniors. Maybe it's good in a way because the examiners will either learn from their mistakes and become excellent by walking through the fire or will get mercilessly crushed by the weight of rework. Time will tell'"
