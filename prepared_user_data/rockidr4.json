        "In response to 'This is why quiet quitting is such bullshit.  Not everyone is a Dwight who is constantly angling for more authority and responsibility, most of us are just Stanleys who want to get through the work day with minimal effort and go home at 5.  This is how workplaces have been for a very long time.', a user said: 'Also the definition of quiet quitting is \"doing the minimum described in your job description\"\nMotherfucker, that's not quiet quitting, that's just upholding your end of the contract. That's just what work is. If that's taking on less responsibility than you used to, it's a sign you should have been promoted, and if your company wants you to go back to doing what you used to, they should fucking promote you'"
