        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is declining—45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'I mean is it surprising? Employees don't get paid enough to afford to live and have ever increasing pressure to output more and more to drive value and stock prices higher, but despite that end up further and further from a good quality of life. This doesn't seem surprising. I would argue you see similar trends all around the world.'",
        "In response to 'Also quiet quitting is literally just “doing the bare minimum of your job as outlined”. It’s not even like.. intense slacking. It’s doing what they pay you to do.', a user said: 'The term \"quiet quitting\" is one anyone who's not a VP or higher should drop. Collectively we should all use the term \"acting your wage\".\n\"Oh you want me to do work beyond my agreed to employment contract/hours/responsibilities? Sure thing, if it's short term, then how about a bonus incentive that's a substantial percentage of my yearly income, and if it's longer term, then let's sit down and discuss a change to my base pay, title, and responsibilities.\"\nWe should all stop following the \"do the job you want, not the job you have\" approach. It's just a way for companies to get free labor from you.'"
