        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I would try to find a pattern in these three trips to hopefully avoid this in future trips. I don’t think you should judge yourself on “quitting” it’s more a question of are you losing money or time off work by returning early.\nPersonally, I’ve noticed that at the 3 week mark I start feeling extra tired and like I’m just over it. So I’ve tried to keep my trips shorter than that. If it can’t be avoided my plan is then to pace myself. Build in some “zero days” where I basically don’t do anything but eat, sleep and recharge. No sightseeing, no excessive walking, heck I’ll even buy comfort food (like fast food or just something more familiar to my normal diet).'"
