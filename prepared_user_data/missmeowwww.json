        "In response to 'Yes, it's the dumbest term ever and I can't believe that it's being normalized. Literally doing your job as described.  It's just corporate gaslighting to make you feel guilty for actually standing up for yourself. If I'm supposed to go above and beyond then so should my pay.', a user said: 'Agree! I go with “setting healthy boundaries”. I do my job to the best of my ability but if the higher ups want me to continuously take on additional projects outside the scope of my position then I expect them to compensate me for it. For example, if the company wants to save money by having me take over specific duties that are not within the scope of my job instead of contracting the work out, I ask for a 3 percent raise. The company is still saving money by not hiring a contractor, the work still gets done, and I’m compensated accordingly for taking on additional duties.'"
