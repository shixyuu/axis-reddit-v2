        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I feel you. I'm not in tech but I make what should be a good middle class income. But I pay OUT THE ASS for my own health care. I live in Michigan so car insurance is outrageous. Cost of everything in the day to day is way up, property taxes are creeping up. I'm putting off needed house maintenance cause some projects local contractors have literally doubled their prices since Covid. I can't afford that, and I can't do the work myself because I'm working. I am saving but BARELY. Definitely not remotely close to what id need for the retirement that will never happen. I think about people I knew in the 90s who were my age now, making significantly less than myself and everything was walking on sunshine. New cars, shiny house, boats, pensions...'",
        "In response to 'I don't even really understand how it's all possible, I mean how can a contractor double their price and still be fully booked? Who is booking them and where are getting all this money from?', a user said: 'That's what I don't understand!!!! Had other projects that were smaller that I did end up doing, contractors didn't even want to bother. \"Too small a job, but if you want ____________ done then keep us in mind\". Somebody is obviously doing well but it ain't me.'"
