        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'This is terribly advised in general, OP if you are asking on ethics, revise your ethical approach to the job you already have.\nI understand the hurt and tragic turn due politics, but do examine if you are not just following the same trend of unethical thinking.\nThis could be a turning point in your career for good, think outside the US-only box and reach colleagues and institutions abroad. Don't speak another language? Learn. Family oriented? Many countries out there share that.'"
