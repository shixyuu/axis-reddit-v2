I don't do 100% any more.\nI consider my body a very specialized and valuable piece of equipment. I don't subject valuable equipment to a 100% duty cycle. Why? I don't want to burn it up.', a user said: 'I used to be so stressed at work for prolonged periods of time that I would find myself literally working myself sick.\nStopped doing that. I get my job done. Anything above and beyond might get done, unless it'll cause me that stress again. Life is more than just work, and unfortunately in most businesses, that's not a concept that management appreciates.'"
