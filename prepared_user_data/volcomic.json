        "In response to '\"Balance\" implies equal priority', a user said: 'Unfortunately in the real world, you can't have much of a life without work. Scenario 1: Live your best life with work as a low priority. How can you afford to do the things you'd like to do (on top of basic food/housing/general existence needs)? What's the plan for retirement years? Scenario 2: Work, work, work and build wealth with no free time to show for it. Skip the best years of your life focused on work? No time to do the things you'd like to do? Retirement's set, but at what cost? Hence; work/life balance. Of course life>work, but that's not how real life works'"
