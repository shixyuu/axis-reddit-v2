        "In response to 'Time for math!\nWalmart gross profit for 2021 was $138,836,000,000.\nWalmart had 2,300,000 employees at the end of 2021.\nThat's enough to give every employee $59,493 - a life-changing amount of money for pretty much everyone.\nThey pay their average employee barely $30,000 a year.', a user said: 'Gross profit is not what the company earned for the year. This is misleading. There are many costs subtracted from this number. Net income is what the company actually earned for the year. Walmart had a net income of $13.673B for 2021. That works out to $5,943 per employee.'"
