        "In response to 'It’s also a morale issue. I’ve worked shops where everyone was pretty happy. We would always do more than our ‘job description’, but the pay was good and the owner was a genuinely good person.\nIf people only want to do the minimum, the company has problems. Not the employees.', a user said: 'My strategy has always been:\nDo 100% of the job I’m paid to do 100% of the time I’m at work. Do no more than that on a regular basis.\nOccasionally, I show the company that I’m capable of doing more, when I decide (not when they ask). But afterwards, if they ask me to do more, then I feel no obligation to do so and I make that obvious. Tell them NO often enough, they won’t expect you to do extra work for no extra pay. Offer a little extra work (or ask for a little extra training) every now and then to show that you are willing to grow and learn, but to be expected to do those extra tasks regularly means that they have to pay you more and update your job description accordingly.\nIt works most of the time. Just doing only your job and never showing your employer that you are capable of more can lead to you getting passed up for promotions and raises. Don’t pigeonhole yourself into your role but don’t get taken advantage of either; its a bit of a game of chess sometimes to advance your career.'"
