All of the blue collar jobs are listing about $1/hr more than they were a year ago, which is a pay cut with inflation. Sure, there are plenty of jobs available,  but don’t act like they are life changing opportunities.'",

It's easier now than it has been in awhile to make those jumps.', a user said: 'I think you missed the first part of my response, they aren’t paying $2.50 more and the minimal increase doesn’t help as much as it would have even 3 years ago. It’s not keeping anyone in those industries from living paycheck to paycheck'",
        "In response to 'I guess what I'm saying is this. My brother was making 16.25 earlier this summer. He changed jobs and is making $18.50 now.\nInflation effed him at 16.25. It's effing him now. But he is making more money than he was in June.', a user said: 'I’m happy he was able to find a better paying job but I’d be surprised if it made any meaningful difference in his lifestyle'"
