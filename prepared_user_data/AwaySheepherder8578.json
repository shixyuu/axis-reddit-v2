        "In response to 'Capitalism has gotten way out of control it used for excuses for inappropriate behavior and actions like a cruch', a user said: 'Capitalism is the worst system out there, except for all the others.'",
        "In response to 'The foundational belief of the left is that everyone is equally deserving of a good life, and we should strive to provide that to them. The foundational belief of the right is that everyone has their rightful place in the hierarchy, and we should strive to put them in that place (or let them take it). One of those openly cares about everyone's wellbeing regardless of connection to us, the other is all about putting you and yours above others.\nYes, anyone can lack empathy, but don't pretend both sides are the same when it comes to caring about people outside their tribe.', a user said: 'No, it’s more like the right thinks you should have equality of opportunity while the left thinks you should have equality of outcome.'",
        "In response to 'The right doesn't believe in equality of opportunity in the slightest, they don't want their kids to have to struggle as much as the poorest kids do, and they don't want resources going to poor kids to give them the same opportunity as their kids. White conservatives don't want their kids to struggle with systemic racism, and they don't want resources going to non-white kids to give them the same opportunity as their kids.\nConservatives believe they've earned their place in the hiearchy for them and theirs, and everyone else has to deal with their own problems. They'll\nsay\nequality of opportunity because they know that the truth sounds bad.', a user said: 'The vast majority of tax revenue comes from the rich, overwhelmingly white. And the vast majority of taxes goes to welfare and entitlement spending, and that’s just from the feds. State and local taxes also go largely to public schools, Medicaid, and other programs for the less fortunate.\nI have no idea what city you’re in but I’ll bet you spend more on your public schools than everything else combined. More than what you spend on cops, fire, roads, combined.\nAnd the rich don’t even use those schools, they send kids to private schools.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Got my boomer parents to say I should quiet quit. So I started a new job 8 days, 6 business day, ago. This is CapitalOne, by the way. Today, my HR manager gives me a call and tells me that I can either take a 25% pay cut or leave my job. I'm not even done onboarding yet, as they want me to watch nearly 40h of trainings along with applying for all my permissions without telling me what they are. On top of that, this was always meant to be a hold-me-over type of jobs, as I already took about a 30% pay cut for this job, but I had been unemployed for nearly a year, and wanted to stop bleeding money. And so I talked afterwards, in private, to some of my team members, and apparently this is just normal behavior for the company.\nMy parents gave me a call for the holidays after work. They asked me how the new job was going, and I told them about it. Both my parents are avid Fox News watcher, and had been complaining about the \"quiet quitting epidemic\" for sometime. My dad, was like, oh you should quit and find a better opportunity, but my mom interrupted my dad and told me that I should \"Take the offer, look for a new job, and do the bare minimum at my current position\". I informed her that, that is literally \"quiet quitting\", and she without missing a beat told me to \"quiet quit\" and my dad soon followed suit.\nMy parents might be pushing 80, but I'm glad I finally got them to see the light of how messed up our economy is. And I feel very proud about it, prouder than most other things in my life, and I made discoveries in my industry that fundamentally changed it, and you know what, I feel more proud about this, than I do that.', a user said: 'Mom is right, quietly quit while looking for a better job. And a better employer.'"
