That is just marketing capitalists are doing to make it out to be something bad.\nYou are just doing exactly what they are paying you to do.', a user said: 'From what I saw, the definition on reddit for quiet quitting was basically to fake doing your job and see how long it takes to get fired. This was during the HUGE labor shortage a year or so ago. Then after about a week of that concept spreading on the internet, there was a massive push by the media to redefine quiet quitting as doing 100% of your job responsibilities ðŸ™„. I canâ€™t prove it, but I saw that happen.'"
