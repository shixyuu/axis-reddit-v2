        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is declining—45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'I’m a member of a Slack group with a bunch of fairly distinguished ex-colleagues. These people are all type-A, highly qualified, high performing, smart and creative, ambitious people including directors, VPs, senior principal individual contributors, even a few executives.\nHow companies treat people in the US has declined so rapidly over the past few years, that even this group of highly motivated and well paid professionals has mostly said “fuck it”. We were discussing the current state of affairs in the US and most of the people in this slack said something similar to “I don’t care anymore. If they are going to treat me this way, then I will put in the bare minimum to avoid being fired.”\nIt’s kind of astonishing to me to hear these ambitious, hardworking, type-a people say this, and I think companies vastly underestimate how much cost cutting and micromanagement disincentives their high performers.'",
        "In response to 'Clearly these top-tier folks aren't getting appropriate top-tier compensation.\nCan't say I blame them for emptying their GAF bag. I would too.', a user said: 'They are very well paid, but amount of stress, bullshit, and lack of humanity makes working hard not worth it anymore.'"
