        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone else's departments like completely falling apart due to people quitting / quiet quitting? We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: 'NOPE! \nOur department is growing heartily, staffing up in a hybrid environment (2 days a week in office, employees choice on which days, with occasional mandatory days for major meetings).\nWe are hiring all the talented people yutzs like you are letting go.\nYour team is way too small for your organizations size, you aren't offering competitive salaries, and you just unironically used the term 'quiet quitting' in a sentence.\nNo one is going to work for you, if you want to change that you could try to stop being an asshole, but from the tone of your post, you might be too far gone at this point.'"
