Other places with stickers on the back the cops use expired plates to initiate the stop then look for drugs or other stuff.', a user said: 'It means a cop doesn't really have a fast way to know it's expired until they've already stopped you for something else.\nAutomated License Plate Readers kind of changed this, though.'",
        "In response to 'Whatâ€¦..', a user said: 'Yeah they've existed for over 5 years now, local PDs around here are slowly starting to pick them up AFAIK'",
        "In response to 'My understanding is the main reason for these is to track plates down that have done something really bad not for things like sticker enforcement. Obviously it could become a revenue generator but if someone shoots someone and speeds off if they go past one of these points, they instantly are flagged. There is upside and downside.', a user said: 'Correct, I review a decent amount of police bodycams and from what I gleaned the ALPRs never make an audible alert for anything less than a felony. Most of the footage I've seen that's started with an ALPR alert involves a stolen car or active felony warrants against the registrant.\nHowever, just because they haven't started using them for detecting drivers with slightly expired paperwork doesn't mean they can't or won't in the future.\nCops absolutely have the means to find out whose registration (or more importantly insurance) is expired in an automated way, it just hasn't been set up for that quite yet.'"
