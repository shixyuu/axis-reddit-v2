        "In response to 'Actually, Work to Rule is also known as \"malicious compliance.\"\nIt's following every rule and regulation to the letter, regardless of common sense, and not taking any shortcuts at all even if those shortcuts do nothing but make your job easier and faster.\nWork to Rule is stuff like, if the policy says you have a tool you need many times a day that's supposed to live in a specific tool cabinet that's to be kept locked at all times when not in use, and the key to that cabinet is supposed to never leave the shift lead's posetion, then\neach and every time you need the tool\nyou go to the shift lead, inform them you need the cabinet unlocked, sign all paperwork to check the tool out, ensure the cabinet is re-locked, go do the work, go get the shift lead\nagain\n, check the tool back in, then go back to your station to continue working until you need the tool again.\nMost people would check it out at the start of your shift and returning it at the end, and nobody would say anything because you use it so often common sense indicates it's \"in use\" the whole shift... but that's not what the actual rules as written say to do, so you do exactly what the rules say.', a user said: 'It’s like the unionized lab techs at a place I used to work. As a software developer I was not allowed to touch the equipment other than a mouse and keyboard (even though it was a clearly labeled switch they made so we could operate the equipment) so I had to schedule a lab tech to get paid to literally sit on his ass and flip the switch back and forth. I can’t make this shit up. This is the toxic side of unionization.'"
