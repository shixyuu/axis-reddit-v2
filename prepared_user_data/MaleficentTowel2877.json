        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'What I donâ€™t understand is that they say they are growing. But in my area they are shutting down and combining kingdom halls, because congregations are so small.'",
        "In response to 'Interesting and thanks for sharing that. Do you mind sharing what part of the world you are in? Just curious where this is happening. It is also happening in some of the less populated areas of the central US.', a user said: 'Tennessee. My grandma who is in her 80s drives 90ish miles round trip to her closest KH now that they sold off the one in her town.'"
