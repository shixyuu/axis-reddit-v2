        "In response to 'Obviously promotions\nhappen\n, just not for the reasons you think.\nAnd I don't mean people are buying promotions with sex (although no doubt that does happen), but promotions are purely about the story you can weave about your career.\nBeing able to work hard isn't the greatest skill you can develop for yourself.\nBeing able to convince others (and knowing who to convince) that you're necessary for their future success, is.\nThe person who keeps their head down, works hard, doesn't complain?  They're exactly where they should be.\nThe person who has ideas, and can articulate them to the right people?  Let's see where you can go.', a user said: 'As someone who has worked their way pretty far up the corp ladder, this person is exactly correct.  Hard workers just get more work.'",
        "In response to 'So what advice would you give to someone to move up instead of just being the worker thatâ€™s puts there head down and just gets the job done?', a user said: 'I'm speaking for American corp culture, so take this with a grain of salt if you are from another country.  I spent a good portion of my adult life in the military, it gave me a different perspective coming in to the corp side, allowing me to see through the bullshit, so to speak.\nYou should be spending the minimum effort to get your job done, the rest (most) of the time is spent on you and your career. This includes networking and \"schmoozing\" for lack of a better term.  As someone who tends to be more on the introverted side, this was difficult for me at first, but like anything else it comes with practice.\nI am also radically transparent with my peers and those I supervise.  My goal being for my team members to succeed not only at work, but in their individual careers as well.  This ensures those that work with me are as loyal as I am with them.'"
