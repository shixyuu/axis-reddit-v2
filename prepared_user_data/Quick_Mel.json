        "In response to 'Yep. I was mostly the same except I eventually, after 13 years, made it through undergrad with a lot of loans and some non-traditional student scholarships. I had many months where the only food I ate was the two discounted meals a day I got at work (or less, because I couldn't even afford the discounted meals). Finished grad school at 32 after about 14 years in the service industry and jumped to a real career path. Took another 6 years or so after that to catch up on my debts (student loans still not paid off today though) and stop living paycheck to paycheck. Unfortunately, my first job that I worked 8 years had a wage freeze for 13 years. No merit raises for anyone. No cost of living increases (their last cola was 1986, because COLAs also meant raising the benefits for retirees). You earned the exact same wage in year 13 that you earned in year 1.\nEven making good money now, living paycheck to paycheck until I was 38 set me back so far that I'm projected to retire at 72\nif\nsocial security still exists. If not? I probably retire when I forced to because I am too old to find a job competing with a bazillion middle aged millennial.', a user said: '37 and I expect to die while working due to a heart attack. I tell everybody NDR  if I ever have one'"
