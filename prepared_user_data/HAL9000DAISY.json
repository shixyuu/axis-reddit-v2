        "In response to 'A lot of people have. RTO means you get exactly eight hours a day, not a second more. It means no one checks their email outside those hours. No one is going above and beyond. We’re too tired from commuting.', a user said: 'To be fair, a lot of WFH haven't been going above and beyond in any case.  At least on my team.  They log in 8 hours and not a minute more.  Nothing wrong with it IMO, but if they were called back to the office, there would not be a major change in productivity.'",
        "In response to 'Something is going terribly wrong if they’re not giving any flexibility in a remote role. Might want to investigate toxicity in management.', a user said: 'They have a ton of flexibility in my group.  They just see their role as working 8am to 5pm.  If we were called back into the office (highly unlikely since we are geographically dispersed), they would work those same hours.  As for me, I am different.  I do work longer hours at home than when I am in the office.  But it's not any quiet quitting reason, I am just trying to beat the traffic home.'"
