        "“Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?",
        "In response to 'Maybe it would be constructive to think of it as energy-matching instead of quiet quitting? It makes no sense at all to bust ass for funding when there is none out there, your timeline is short, and they’ve basically given you your marching orders. It would be reckless NOT to build your exit plan.', a user said: 'Ohhh I like this term “energy matching”…'",
        "In response to 'Just don't write it. Keep saying \"oh yeah I'm working on it\" and then fail to deliver it. You're getting fired anyway.', a user said: 'Great - this is my preferred strategy and it’s helpful to get some validation. As academics we are not used to not performing, but I’m done with all of it.'",
        "In response to 'I’ve been doing this since the termination of my grants earlier this year - riding out the remainder of my contract while I look for other jobs and research gigs. My university likewise said I can keep my position if I bring in money to cover my salary, but only gave me and my faculty colleagues ~10 weeks to do that. Won’t let us spend the 500K + in residuals we brought to them, treated my staff colleagues terribly… so yeah, I don’t feel bad about it.\nEdit: I’m not sure how much they’re micromanaging your activity - mine doesn’t. But if they press you, just say you’re looking for opps. Or submit half-assed proposals.', a user said: 'This is validating - thank you! And best of luck out there'",
        "In response to 'Research existing grants for your own non-profit or consulting company. You don’t have to submit them for the university… but you can draft them and submit a few for the F of it. But it’s an exercise in surveying the space for money that can be used for starting a small business if you’re open to that.', a user said: 'Omg I LOVE this idea! There are grants that fund consulting companies??'",
        "In response to 'Write it with ChatGPT and call it a day. Of course it’s not “unethical “ to do what you have to do to save yourself from this mess. Being on soft money at this time is the worst possible position.\nFor what it’s worth, I’m tenured and I’m looking for a way out because it’s clear my research is essentially kaput.', a user said: 'ChatGPT is amazing for this use indication!'",
        "In response to 'Haven't you ever had a proposal rejected before? Just change the title and resubmit.', a user said: 'This is a great idea!'",
        "In response to 'You should be looking out for yourself first and foremost because your employer does not care about you beyond the money you can provide. I’d be actively looking for another job. Personally, I’d be looking beyond just traditional industry R&D as the job market is terrible. There are jobs out there if you are willing to focus on transferable skills rather than technical skills.', a user said: 'Yes, I’m definitely interested in using my transferable skills rather than technical. Any industries in particular you think are accessible to academics right now?'",
        "In response to 'I wouldn’t write the grants. I mean I guess it’s possible you get them funded and then they’ll retain you.', a user said: 'True, although at this point I don’t want to be retained 🤷🏼'",
        "In response to 'Am happily doing the same elsewhere, not for the same reason, but IT FEELS GOOD.\nI feel like it is back-pay for a job overdone in the past, balancing the scale, so to speak.', a user said: 'Yes - I feel the same way.'",
        "In response to 'Why have you convinced yourself that you can’t get a grant in the next 12 months?', a user said: 'I know I can, I just don’t want to anymore. I’d have to “pivot” away from everything that brought me into this career in the first place.'",
        "In response to 'I get why you feel that way now, but what about science inspired you to go into a career with such a low % chance of getting to where you are now? And then inspired you to put in the insane amount of effort required to be a full prof?', a user said: 'I happen to be squarely focused in one of the now “banned” areas of science. So I can no longer get federal funding for the science that once inspired me.'",
        "In response to 'What field of study/research are you in?? Asking as a nervous graduate student starting this fall...', a user said: 'Public health 😟'"
