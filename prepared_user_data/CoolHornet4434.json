        "In response to 'I would love that', a user said: 'I think the idea sounds appealing until you realize you're just sitting there alone, doing nothing useful, and sure you're getting paid for it, but after a while it sorta drags you down... I can imagine finding it extremely boring and there's only so much surfing and scrolling I can do in 8 hours to make up for it.  I'd probably use that time to find another job so when I quit I could move straight to something better.'"
