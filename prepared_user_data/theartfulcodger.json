        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet Quitting”, not quite quitting, but forcing employers to adapt. [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: '\"Quiet quitting\" is simply an employer's passive-aggressive pejorative for \"finding a more appropriate and fulfilling work-life balance\".\nAs a recent retiree who now realizes he spent too much of his working life heavily invested in his employers' problems, and who now regrets having wasted all that time and energy, I would encourage ALL younger workers to set firm boundaries on their employers' ability to bind them - financially, emotionally\nand\ntemporally.'"
