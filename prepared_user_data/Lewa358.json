        "In response to 'I agree but some people are conscientious and alot of government work is very important.  People need services, for instance.   You feel bad letting work go undone because you know it may be impacting someone who really needs whatever that thing is.  We had rueful jokes when I worked there about 50% of the employees doing 100% of the work.  Known poor workers still got raises and still got bonuses.  It was extremely frustrating and demoralizing.   It's one of the reasons I left federal service.', a user said: 'This is the other side of all this talk about standing up to worker exploitation. It's one thing to assertively refuse to kill yourself so your employer can make new doodads to sell at an outrageous pace--the world won't be a worse place if Apple takes a little more time to sell its next iPhone, for instance--but there's lots of organizations such as government departments that actively lose money, so employers' demands are inherently coming from a much less malicious place.\nOn the other hand\n, government workers are still individuals with stresses, desires, hopes, dreams, etc. I don't care if you're solving world hunger or curing every disease on the planet, you still deserve to have a life outside of work and to live in relative comfort. If workers have to crunch to help people in need, that's still on the agency for being understaffed. Yes, they're likely underfunded, but\nthat's\nthe problem, not workers' inability or unwillingness to work outrageously hard.\nSo in short people need to pay taxes so that agencies don't have any individuals doing \"100% of the work.\"'"
