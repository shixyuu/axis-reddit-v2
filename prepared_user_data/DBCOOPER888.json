        "In response to 'No paper, didnâ€™t have to sign anything else, employer just said verbally unsatisfactory performance. Would that still grant me unemployable benefits?', a user said: 'That's open for interpretation. Perhaps the performance wasn't good enough to survive a reduction in force, but before the lay offs the performance was fine.\nAlso, do you have performance appraisals?'",
        "In response to 'Aaah great thanks for replying ðŸ˜„. Others here want me to lie like saying laid off but because i sucked at my job I should be able to collect some unemployment', a user said: 'The unsatisfactory performers are the first to get laid off in a reduction in force.'",
        "In response to 'You just stop going in to work or doing any of the work. You never tell anyone anything. Itâ€™s like ghosting someone on tinder but for work.', a user said: 'This isn't true. Actual quiet quitting is working the bare minimum and not going above and beyond.\nIf OP just stopped working completely he's not using the term as it is commonly used.'"
