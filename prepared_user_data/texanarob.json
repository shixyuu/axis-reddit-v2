        "In response to 'Replace \"minimum required\" by required alone and it no longer sounds like employees are underperforming or unprofessional. Doing the required tasks and going home is being professional.', a user said: 'I paid Â£2 for 100g of chocolate, and when it arrived it was only 100g of chocolate! This is an outrage! How dare they give me the bare minimum required? Where's my 110%? Where's the coffee? Everyone knows that coffee goes well with chocolate, it should be a given that you provide me with coffee when I buy chocolate! They gave me free coffee before, and the other company used to provide crisps for free as well before they went bust. Nobody wants to sell snacks anymore!'"
