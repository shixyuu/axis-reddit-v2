        "In response to 'Because a lot of poor managers ride the coattails of their best employee.', a user said: 'This'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: How to effectively quiet quit as the highest performer on my team I am the team's highest performer. I have a lead IC role (\"hybrid management\") where a lot of my job duties involve coaching, development plans and employee growth. I am one of two lead ICs and there are like 3-4 other ICs on the team.\nOver the past two years, I've taken this position very seriously and have operated at a much higher level (the position above mine) than expected. I was rapidly promoted to lead IC in less than a year and I have been told that going into full management is \"mine if I want it\". The difference between myself and the other ICs on the team (including lead IC) is pretty dramatic. I'm easily doing twice or three times the workload and have a much higher operational proficiency, client satisfaction, etc.\nFor a plethora of reasons, I've become totally disillusioned with the institution, middle/upper management, and the position. What's compounding my anger/depression is that I took my position as a downgrade in my career, but intended to be underpaid and underappreciated for 2-ish years to build up hands-on experience in a new industry. I've been ACTIVELY trying to get OUT and make a lateral or upwards move (externally, not internally as my institution does not offer internal jobs) and because of the PARTICULARLY shitty state of the white-collar job market (\"worse than 2008\"), I have been faced with rejection after rejection after rejection, usually after getting 99% of the way there. I also have particular grievances about the way that middle/upper management has \"strung me along\" on a variety of promises. I look back and see that I'm literally ROTTING in what was supposed to be a temporary position, in the prime years of my career, and I feel STUCK (can't get out no matter how hard I try).\nIt's important to note that I really don't *like* the idea of quiet-quitting. I always used to say \"why would you quiet quit? Just go find a better job that you feel fulfilled in\". The problem now is that I'm so bitter at the institution that putting in extra effort feels nauseating and violating, and I'm STUCK at this job due to the extremely terrible job market (unless I restart my career entirely or quit without a job lined up).\nAnyways, circling back to the point of my question: I've become widely known as such an aggressive overperformer that my bosses have flat-out told me that overperformance has become my new baseline for expected monthly performance. I used to easily get \"exceeds expectations\" every month, whereas now they want me to continuously struggle and squeeze every drop of effort out of myself just to justify a \"meets expectations\". My goal for quiet quitting is to start putting in the same amount of effort as the other lead IC, who notoriously underperforms but is never held accountable. However, it's going to become extremely and immediately apparent as soon as my next monthly performance evaluation hits, and my managers are going to be asking me \"WTF is going on\".\nI fear that this will immediately result in 1-2 months of \"does not meet expectations\", followed swiftly by a PIP or something like that. I'll be told to go back to my previous baseline, and when I don't, I'll be accused of insubordination or something. I really don't want to deal with this level of mental stress, especially as I'm already highly depressed from my rejections while job-searching.\nDo any managers here have an idea of what I should do to effectively and smartly go from \"ultra top performer\" to quiet-quitter?', a user said: 'Make job searching your new side hustle.\nWhatâ€™s in writing (metrics)? Meet those expectations.\nRegardless of what leadership says about not meeting your prior levels, keep doing it and say youâ€™re doing the best you can and thankfully still hitting your targets.\nIn the meanwhile, start securing previous annual reviews, letters/emails of accolades, potential references and networks contact info, and a Plan B (in case they let you go although this would make no sense considering your high performance, but stranger things have happened). Use your vacation and PTO. If youâ€™re in the health insurance plan, make any appointments needed.'",
        "In response to 'I am trying to make job searching a side hustle. It's just very demoralizing, because I get out of work at 6:30 PM on the weekdays so between exercising, cooking, eating, cleaning and sleeping, I have NO time to apply during the week. On the weekend, I can spend an entire day \"working\" by applying to 20 jobs or so, but then I'm so stressed out and upset that I try and try and scavenge whatever little time I have via revenge nighttime procrastination. It adds to my depression during the week. On the weekend I just want to work on my own personal projects (coding, music, etc) and when I can't do that for whatever reason I get very upset and end up having a worse week for it', a user said: 'Totally get it. Are you able to alter your schedule, temporarily, until you secure a new job? For example, work and all the weekday things after work. Job search on Saturdays til 5 then recreation/family/friends/events? Sundays- rest and music? However you can make it most feasible for your life during this time.'",
        "In response to 'Yes, this is the current schedule I'm following. It does work decently. I spend saturday job-searching. My girlfriend also demands attention and time spent together too which is fair, because I usually can't give her more than 15 minutes per day during the week (we live together). In moment of depression I just want to dive in harder to my personal projects, my coding and my music creation even more. This often creates arguments between us. I am an only child and am used to just being alone all the time, whereas she is constantly trying to spend ALL her time with me, which I totally get.', a user said: 'Iâ€™d go nuts. ðŸ˜£ Not an only child but vigilant about my alone time.\nWishing you all the best throughout this time.'"
