        "In response to 'Home phones were a thing.', a user said: 'Landlines were very different.\nIt was so much fun giving my wife's terrible boss the runaround when she called our landline back in like '92.\nI'd greet her boss and act all friendly, ask how her family was, whether she'd seen the football game â€” like it was a \"social call\" like folks did back when.\nThen she'd cut me off and say she needed her underling.\nI'd say, \"Oh, this is about work? Wow, you're working on Saturday again? OK, one second, I'll go get her.\"\nThen I'd leave the phone off the hook for about 5 minutes, then come back and say, \"I checked all around, then I noticed her car isn't here. She must be running an errand.\"\nBoss would stress how important it was she got back to her as soon as possible.\n\"OK, I'll leave a note on the fridge. I'm going to be heading out in a few minutes to go kayaking. I think she should see the note, that's the best place for it.\"\nBoss would stress again how important it was she get a call back. (It really, really wasn't important. Some hotel wanted to know what color tablecloths they should put on some tables or something. But boss wasn't going to make the call herself!)\nI'd assure her my wife was usually not away for more than a few hours doing errands. (By this time, she was, indeed, out of the house.) I'd apologize, still all friendly and cheerful, that I could only write a note, but that my friends would be expecting me, and the beer wasn't getting any colder (to rub in to bossy boss just how much her life sucked).'"
