Why is that so hard?', a user said: 'where i work the union contract says the boss has to pay you overtime (time and a half) if they request or order you work extra hours. so they won't ask you to and will just announce this kinda stuff at staff meetings looking for a volunteer just so they can avoid paying time and a half. if it's voluntary then they only have to give you comp time in your time off bank which basically costs them nothing'"
