They would need to fire and re-hire  you with a lower salary to accomplish that, but doing so is considered unjustified dismissal so it gives you ground for legal complaints.\nIt sucks to have you doing quiet quitting a week into the new job, but at least you know that things won’t be getting any better so you can move on with looking for another job.', a user said: 'What country? Guessing Europe.'",
        "In response to 'Mexico. But let me take the opportunity to correct one of my points. Your salary can be reduced as long as you consent to it by written. But they cannot do it if you refuse, and if they do it anyways you have the legal advantage.', a user said: 'So if you refuse, they can't just fire you? In the US they can.'",
        "In response to '25% cut 8 days into the job is wild. Capital One is behaving like this!?  This surprises the shit outta me.', a user said: 'Yeah, they are my credit card company...'",
        "In response to 'Beautiful! This Boomer supports you as well. Nice to hear of others in my generation who are willing to learn.', a user said: 'Mine love Fox and are somewhat indoctrinated but their intelligence flairs up at times. So frustrating considering my mom literally my grandma (now deceased) from watching Fox back in the day (around 2020 with elections, racism, protests, COVID) as she started being aggressive over the content. It was sad to witness and bias on both sides needs to  go away. It won't though.'"
