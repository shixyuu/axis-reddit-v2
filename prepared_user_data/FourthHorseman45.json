        "In response to 'Being asked myself to go from full time WFH to hybrid. You better bet I am going to deliberately slow down my productivity on those office days, besides the fact it will naturally happen due to all the “collaboration”.\nAlso pulling way back on my flexibility with my hours when asked, no more jumping on for the odd thing for 5 mins after hours.\nI always thought my employment accommodations and compensation were a negotiation with my employer independent of my work colleagues. Apparently no it’s unfair to others who are hybrid if I’m WFH.', a user said: 'It’s unfair to others Rolls Eyes have you asked them if their idea of fairness also extends to bumping up your pay to match the pay of those earning more than you? Because it’s unfair that you’re being paid less. If they give you you the \"oh well they are doing different jobs\" ask why different jobs with different requirements applies in this case but not to you working remotely'",
        "In response to 'You think all jobs should pay the same? Lmfao what is this logic', a user said: 'If you take a moment to apply those good ol' reading comprehension skills, you would see that in fact I don't believe that, and was using it as an\nallusion\nto how bosses are saying that everyone should return to office for \"fairness\" to underline how ridiculous their point is.'"
