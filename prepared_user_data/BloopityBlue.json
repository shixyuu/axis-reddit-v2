        "In response to 'Hardly a lazy solution. I’m able to do the job of five people that are on the shift before me and have been doing that for years. The solution seems more than appropriate. 1 person doing the work of 1 person now.', a user said: 'That's not really quiet quitting, IMO.... that's \"rightsizing expectations.\" There is zero reason why you should be doing the work of 5 people. Do a good job at your job, and kick ass executing the work of one person...\n​\nThe fact that this is seen as quiet quitting shows a lot about the state of employment right now. No one should be doing more than their own jobs, working their own hours, not working a ton of unpaid overtime, not killing themselves for their job\n​\nI literally had a C level employee look me dead ass in the eye last week and tell me that \"working some saturdays is normal\" -- when most of the people on my team area already working 50 hours days M-F.\nI will not be working Saturdays - no matter how hard they try to normalize that shit. No.'"
