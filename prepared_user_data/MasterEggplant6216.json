        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'Not unethical at all.  Unethical would be taking a position because your husband has a year to go before he gets his PhD and then moving with him to another university.  (We had that happen so a precious faculty line gone and the start up money with it as well.)  What you are doing is perfectly fine.  Just make sure that you know how much notice you must give when you find that better position.  I wish you the best going forward.  If I was not so old, I would consider doing the same thing.  Academia is HARD.'"
