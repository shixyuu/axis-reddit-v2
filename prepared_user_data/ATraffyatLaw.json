You don't actually do that much lol, maybe the insane working hours made sense when everything was being done on paper, by hand. Now with computer databases/excel/AI workloads are decreased dramatically. Now a large part of your job is sitting around trying to look busy instead of being given any mentally stimulating tasks.'"
