        "In response to 'I used to give 110% to jobs, be really conscientious, work extra hours, be so friendly towards colleagues and got nothing to show for it. The more you care, the more you can be burned imo.\nNow I look upon it as a transaction. I sell my time, they pay me for it. I switch off my computer on the dot and I leave. I don't slack exactly but if they want more out of me, they should pay me more.\nAnd to be quite honest, if I didn't need to work to afford basic necessities such as food, clothes, a roof over my head, I wouldn't work at all. I laugh when people say \"oh if I won the lottery I couldn't give up working\"- I'd be out the door as soon as I could. Wouldn't even work my notice!', a user said: 'This was me as a younger worker. Stay late, volunteer for tasks, grumble at the older staff leaving early to pick up kids, and mocking them for their lack of commitment.\nI didn't know they were the wise ones, and I was the fool!'"
