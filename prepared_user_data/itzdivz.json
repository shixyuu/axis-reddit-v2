        "In response to 'We can thank Reagan and conservatives who have made it so that no matter how hard you work you don’t get shit. We’ve catered to soft republicans and their feelings (war on Christmas anyone?) rather than fix societal injustices and our economic system. Now we’ve got fascists in office making everything worse because they can’t stand to be told no.\nIt’s a sad time. If this country and the world were less conservative we’d still have a work ethic.\nGood on you for calling out conservative bullshit.', a user said: 'Sad part is they dont care and they wont live long enough to see it collapse . As long as theyre getting their fair share who cares about the future.'"
