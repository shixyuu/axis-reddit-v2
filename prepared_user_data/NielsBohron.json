        "In response to 'I have such low respect for people studying HR for this very reason. It's like they are willing to betray their class/community just to gain a good salary and a good employment outlook', a user said: 'People who are studying HR? Maybe, I guess.  HR seems like a weird department to target here, but maybe I'm just used to working in a public education setting.  But in my experience, most HR professionals are just trying to\nhelp people apply/get jobs,\nunderstand their benefits once they get the job\nMake sure labor laws are being followed\nMake sure management understands those labor laws and doesn't say or do anything illegal.\nIn addition, in most government jobs, HR is also actively working to minimize the effects of systemic discrimination.\nSource: I teach at a community college and my wife (who has a BS in Biology, not HR) works in HR\nedit: at the same college'"
