I know, in the states, it was used to basically used to describe doing what was outlined in your job(s) contract & not going over and beyond.\nThat's not \"\nquiet quitting\n\" that's doing your job. Workers shouldn't feel pressured to do an ounce more than the job they signed up to do.\nEdit:\nWorkers said they do the basics required for their jobs for various reasons, but cite wanting a better work-life balance or feeling indifferent about their career path as prime reasons for losing motivation at work.\nIt seems it's being applied similarly here too. If employers want more work. Let them pay more money & put it in the contracts & let employees know up front when they sign up for the job.', a user said: 'Imagine flipping it around, \"employers pay their staff the minimum required to keep them from quitting in a trend\". No shit, this is the standard behaviour of employers.'"
