        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'I’m actually quietly quitting. How you actually do that is don’t do the work. Clear as day. I do the absolute bare minimum and if shit goes wrong I blame a process that management hasn’t implemented, because ultimately it’s their fault.'",
        "In response to 'That's just called working.', a user said: 'Lol no. My work is getting noticed or the lack there of it.'",
        "In response to 'Is your endgame to get fired and collect unemployment? Most employers are scared to fire people for issues that are not major. At my work there are ppl who work very hard and ppl who just chill and do a little work. They have never fired anybody for doing too little work. I imagine the raises are greater for the harder workers but if your job doesn't give much of a raise then fuck it, bare minimum it is!', a user said: 'End game is to get fired or laid off. At my job they will fire you if you are not productive enough. I work in tech so I’m actually waiting for the hammer to drop any day now. I worked my ass off making this company a lot of money and I got like a 3k raise and absolutely no recognition lmao. Since the beginning of the year and a few other things that happened, I’ve decided to do nothing. If I get laid off I get unemployment. If I stay and do very to no work I get my 6 fig pay check. It’s a win win for me.'"
