        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'It's not \"Quiet Quitting\"\nIt's \"Working to Rule\" which is an essential tool in the workers' playbook before striking. It's a great way to show the employer the value you add, by stopping adding that value and doing exactly what is in your contract: no more, no less.'"
