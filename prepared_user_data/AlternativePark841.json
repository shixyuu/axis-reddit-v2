        "In response to 'Yes, Iâ€™m definitely interested in using my transferable skills rather than technical. Any industries in particular you think are accessible to academics right now?', a user said: 'Contrary to what many of those in academia seem to believe, (unless you are some kind of recognized bigwig in your field) tech/biotech/pharma really don't care about someone in academia. Publishing papers, mentoring students and postdocs, etc. is not like some huge boost to your CV that's going to get you hired in no time. Having an academic career is not a benefit. It's probably actually a disadvantage. It's an absolute bloodbath out here right now with layoffs. So many industry PhDs are unemployed and you'll be competing with them, at a disadvantage, if you try to go to industry.\nIf you want an industry job, you may want to try starting things off at a CRO.\nGood luck.'"
