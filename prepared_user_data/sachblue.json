Someone calls in, you're the first person they call. Then whenever you can't and have to say no. They get mad at you and not the employee who called out or the lazy coworker who won't pick up their slack. It's always because you're the one expected to do so, not them.', a user said: 'Are you reading my mind? I got shafted by a lazy coworker and got pip'd as a result. I got out of PIP by doing bare minimum, but that lazy mofo got caught red-handed doing nothing (let go due to performance). Learned that I cannot be kind to all...but I hate that lesson still.'"
