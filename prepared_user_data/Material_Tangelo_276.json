        "In response to 'Original Post: New type of quitting discovered \"Quiet quitting is easy to identify; employees who are quiet quitters visibly reduce their effort and avoid going the extra mile. Soft quitting, on the other hand, happens quietly over time. Employees don’t necessarily reduce their work output, but their enthusiasm fades, their curiosity dwindles, and their emotional connection to their work diminishes.\"\nThe cure is to lick the boot harder.', a user said: 'My Dunkin Donuts is currently undergoing a remodel that was “in the works” for months—since October I’ve been trying to secure work at other locations. It was set for 12/28–then pushed to 1/6. When we came to work on 1/2 we were told it was our last day and that if we had any sick time my manager “had the approval”(what a fucking joke, but that’s a whole other thing) to push that through but, he’d been running around like crazy getting things ready because it got moved up!!(yet again only worried about himself.)\nAnyway, I found out through coworkers the next day that he’d gotten hours for every single person EXCEPT me. I assume because he wants me to quit. I’m not. I intend to go back and make it very awkward for him, because otherwise he just gets to pretend that he’s a fucking delight.\nThe point of all this is to say that they don’t give two flying fucks about any of us. And it’s high time we return that sentiment.\nManagement is bad. Corporate is bad. Work that isn’t respectful, rewarding or doesn’t compensate you for your contributions fairly IS ALL WORK in this late-stage capitalist hellscape. FUCK EM.'"
