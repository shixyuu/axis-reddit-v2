        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'Last year I started just doing what my contract asks of me, it's been difficult to say the least. \nI'm tired of being seen as lazy just because I don't want to \"do my share for the team\"\nTired of missing my breaks and staying late.\nI started this up when I did the math of how much extra I actually did, I added the the extra time up that I did over a few years and I was shocked to see that my time added up to 8 months of work days.\nNo one in their right mind would willingly work at their job unpaid for 8 months.\nI'm there to do my job from start time to finish have my break and go home no more no less.'"
