        "In response to 'Original Post: This would be taken as \"quiet quitting\" [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/yxchlyvvsz3a1.jpg', a user said: 'Me when I show my supervisor that I am a forklift driver and display my license in his face. He hates it but technically I'm supposed to be doing nohing but drive. And I told him I'm not doing nothing but drive and he switched me to just driving. Finnaly after complaing to other supervisors etc...I'm able to drive again and not do all that manual labor I didn't even sign up for . I quietly quit as well. That's the best tactic and it works. 10/10 I'd recommend.  Good post'"
