        "In response to 'Im wondering if someone my age even has a chance to work up in amazon. I’m a rehire but before I asked to do a lot of things, like problem solver. I’m 41 and I didn’t see anyone above probably 30 working in higher positions and most of the problem solvers were like 19. One of the kids on the AR floor looked 12. My AM was most likely 20 years old..\nI was always in the top 15 for stowing in the building, I had good work ethic but they passed me up for problem solving twice. I didn’t bring attention to myself and didn’t cause drama. I even got a shoutout during stand up in pack while I was cross training for doing such a good job my 3rd day. Still.. nothing. I signed up for every thing but was never picked. I’m going into outbound this time so hopefully it’ll be different.', a user said: 'You may not stand out, and that is your issue. You need to be noticed and able to lead. You can't show you can lead by not standing out in ways other than working hard and going home. You need to show you know how to communicate well with others. It isn't always about how hard you work when it comes to moving up in the work force. Not everyone is able to lead , some are just hard workers but not leaders.'"
