        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'I haven't quit it, because my husband works over 50 hours a week so if I don't do it no one else will. But I have lowered my expectations of meal planning, because trying to plan and shop for a whole week was stressing me out, plus we were wasting food by ordering takeaway and letting groceries go off. Now I shop for 3 days at a time. If we happen to get takeaway the food is usually still fresh enough to eat. I have also picked 9 dishes we like, and rotate through them three at a time so it doesn't feel too repetitive, but it also isn't totally overwhelming. This is working for us because I am on mat leave, but I suspect we will have to revisit when I go back to work.'"
