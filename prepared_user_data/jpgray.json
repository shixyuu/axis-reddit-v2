It’s not the tooth fairy, it’s literally happening.\nBusinesses don’t generally increase wages for inflation directly but for what the job is ‘worth’ by what people will accept to do the job (which tracks with inflation).

It’s not the tooth fairy, it’s literally happening.\nPeople don't get to C-suite position because they're especially smart or uniquely talented. They get there\nbecause they lack the ability to feel empathy\n. It doesn't take talent or genius to figure out how to exploit people, all it takes is a lack ability to care about their wellbeing.'"
