Just stay in the office for an hour to finish the presentation. Oh this project needs to go to the client before the morning, so can you just do this one push through the evening for it. Well Bob is working this evening, so you can stay online to support him? And so on. It's pretty insidious as the number of hours just slowly creeps until it becomes normalised.', a user said: 'Sure.  I don’t dispute that self-exploitation also exists in U.K. too.'",
        "In response to 'My employer sent out an article about it to all staff, but mainly aimed at management.
