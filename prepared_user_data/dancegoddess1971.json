        "In response to 'Just do what you agreed to. Simple as that. If they want more from you, they have to pay you more. Why would you work for free? And also why should you work your ass off at all? And for what? You just get more on your plate for the same pay. More work gets rewarded with more responsibilities and more work. Rarely you get more pay. Or the classic „alrighty, you work 55 hours instead of 39 now and get.. let me check.. 1.2 % more pay. Isn’t that great?!“ Yeah.. Fuck that noise', a user said: 'If you are asked to do something not listed in scope of job, thank them for the promotion and ask what your new pay will be. No promotion? You just want me to pick up the work of the manager you just fired with no additional compensation? I was under the impression that it's so difficult they get extra money and benefits. What gives?'",
        "In response to 'I've actually yelled at co-workers who were not taking their breaks.\nOur half-hour break is unpaid. So you DO NOT fucking skip it. It's fine to pospone it. If a supervisor asks you to work through it, he's asking you to break the local labor laws, and you should come tell me so I can yell at the supervisor. But take your fucking break!', a user said: 'Since WFH, our system logs us out automatically after 4 hours. We are forcibly reminded to take our break by the system. There was some confusion at first. People thought it was a bug. Lol. Nope. Take your break.'"
