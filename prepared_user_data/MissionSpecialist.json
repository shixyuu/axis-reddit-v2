        "In response to 'you're supposed to work 80 hour weeks for a 40 hour salary\nWorking 40 hour weeks for a 40 hour salary is somehow impossible but the profits keep rolling in and upper-level management keeps buying newer and fancier cars. If you work hard, you too can see your boss buy a new car.', a user said: 'I run a global team of engineers (tech) and tell every one of them to work their 40 hours and then unplug. If management wants things done faster, they can give us more headcount.\nDitto with after-hours work; if you haven't shifted your schedule that day (i.e. working 1-9 instead of 9-5 to handle an evening maintenance window) or you're not otherwise paid to be on call, feel zero obligation to answer any work-related calls or messages.\nSalaried/exempt is not a secret cheat code for \"Negotiate a salary based on 40hrs/week baseline and then expect employees to do 60hrs instead\".\nAmerican and Indian engineers struggle to believe I mean the above, and Western European engineers struggle to understand why I need to say something so obvious. It's an interesting dichotomy. As is the difference in turnover and (non-existent) difference in work output compared to teams that are worked like rented mules.'"
