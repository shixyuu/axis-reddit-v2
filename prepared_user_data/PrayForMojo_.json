        "In response to 'I always felt bad for the two bobs. They're not actually a villain or an antagonist, they're stuck just like Peter is. They can make all the recommendations they want but the actual management will never go for them because it cuts into their personal profits and beliefs.\nThe bobs\nclearly\nsee the problem when the eight bosses are mentioned, you can see it in their face, they way they sit up in disbelief at the top-heavy middle management. The company's culture and management is rotten and they're being brought in by some overpaid schmuck to flatter them and make it seem like its the lower employees fault.\nSo the bobs are stuck clinging to the low-effort 'easy' answers like stock options. That's most likely to be acceptable and keep them from being fired and given a bad rep as consultants. It won't cost the company a dime because its basically giving out fun bucks as far as the board is concerned in the short term. Hell they'll probably put some clause in that quitting before x-years (as opposed to being let go) is grounds to void your options.\nit's all half-assed in the end\n.\nPeter understands this and that's why he's fully honest with them. Its more than just wanting to stick the finger to the company, it's venting to people also stuck in the bullshit rat race. Just like he was honest with the waitress.\nIsn't that movie great?', a user said: 'Ok but the Bobs also did take some glee and humour in firing people. Naga…Naga…nagana-work here anymore. Or the way they describe “solving” the Milton problem. Those two enjoyed their jobs and enjoyed firing people. I have no sympathy for them.'"
