        "In response to 'Greg's response is as follows:\nIf you just accept employees doing the bare minimum to get by, then you’re “quiet quitting” your job as a manager. Bottom line: You can’t force anyone to do anything. Employees who coast are usually disengaged from their work, so figuring out how to get them motivated is the only way to get them to naturally sustain higher engagement. If you can’t, or they won’t, then you can set expectations for performance and outcomes. And if they don’t meet those expectations, you can quietly fire the quitters.\nSource:\nhttps://nypost.com/2022/08/21/can-i-discipline-my-employees-who-are-quietly-quitting/\nI think this is bullshit. Greg doesn't know the meaning of the word \"minimum\". If you expect more than the minimum, then the level you called \"minimum\" isn't actually the minimum. The minimal level is the lowest acceptable level.', a user said: 'They do quietly fire the workers. If doing the minimum work required is quiet quitting, then paying the minimum salary is quiet firing.'"
