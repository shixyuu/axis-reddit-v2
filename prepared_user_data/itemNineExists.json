        "In response to 'The thing is that I’ve sat through most of the recent Republican debates and nobody answers the questions asked by the moderators and nobody actually has any opposing opinions. So there’s nothing to debate anyways. They won’t even condemn trump. (Then why are you running)', a user said: 'I mean, is that a criticism of debates? Or would any debate with these candidates be no better?\nI think perhaps candidates should be penalized for giving a long answer without actually answering questions'",
        "In response to 'Hell yeh. With this nations attention span this day and age they should run it like a game show. Real time fact checking and eliminate contestants for not answering the question, making up bullshit on the spot, and changing the subject until only two remain. Now THAT is something that would generate clicks.', a user said: 'Old school Nickelodeon rules: break the rules, get slimed'",
        "In response to 'I did hear some people saying debates were outdated anyway.\n​\nThat being said, I do wish they're here in 2024, since Kennedy might qualify and, while I think he's a bad candidate, I would enjoy a three way debate.', a user said: 'Debates are not outdated. That's a strange concept. I want to know how they respond to each other, as do the (at least) tens of millions of Americans who watch them'"
