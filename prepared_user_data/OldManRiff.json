        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: '\"Quiet quitting\" is exactly that - quitting a job quietly. I've seen people quit pretty fucking loudly before.\nWorking to the extent of what is required of you is called \"working.\" Calling working to the extent of what is required of you \"quiet quitting\" is hot, wet shit straight from the assholes of the ownership class, and the ownership class can go fuck themselves.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'Mine are discovering \"quiet failing.\" I don't nag, I don't call, I don't email. The gradebook is up to date. Pass, fail, do what you want, I'll still have a job.'"
