        "In response to 'Hey OP, I saw\nthis thread on Twitter\nsome days ago. So much truth in it. So many people speaking up about management screw ups draining the soul out of people willing to put in their best work. I am on the same boat as you, every day wondering if today is the day I am giving my notice. This shit is almost making me believe I should not be in this industry anymore. Just waiting for an offer from a better place.\nIMO you did not TIFU. They did. Don't worry much about what happened. Management would\nrage quit you\nin a second over a freaking red cell in a quarterly finance spreadsheet. Change Control Boards are a symptom of bad processes in place, lack of automation and an abundance of tech debt due to unrealistic leadership goals. Soon enough you'll be in a f*ing Pagerduty rotation interrupting your personal life at 3AM because of them, while making you believe this is\nyour\nproblem. F*'em, go somewhere else where you're respected as a human being.', a user said: 'Management failing upward is infuriatingly common.'"
