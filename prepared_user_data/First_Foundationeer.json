        "In response to 'There are plenty of left-leaning Christians from liberal Christianity to Christian socialism. The historic abolitionist, progressive, and civil rights movements often drew from religious thought and swelled from Christians in their ranks (Muslims and religious Jews too).\nReligion itself isn’t an enemy here. Conservative Christianity (and, of course, the abuse of religion) is. For the record, I’m not proselytizing. Or religious.', a user said: 'I mean, let's remember that most people were religious (whether their belief was a non-interventionist divinity or some bullshit alien is a longer conversation) in those days so it's not really a big deal to say that both good and bad were historically done by religious folks. Developing nations tend to cast off the crutch of religion as they mature because it's an insane heuristic that isn't necessarily tied to reality, which causes problems down the road.\nI think religion\nis\nthe enemy. A particular instance of religion may not be bad in its current form, but give it one or two generations. It will become the conservative extremism that you think is the enemy. (Personally, I think we should figure out a different way to create communities that doesn't involve fantasies.)'"
