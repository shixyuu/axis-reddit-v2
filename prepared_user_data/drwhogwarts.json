        "In response to 'This term really is corporations responding to the mass realisation that they can't bully and trick 1 person into doing 2 people's jobs any more.\nMore like 5 these days but yeah.\nI hope that this expectation that 1 employee must do more than the work of 1 worker for just above minimum wage in order to be hired/keep their position will die sooner rather than later.', a user said: 'I hope so, too.  At my last job I tried sticking up for myself and it fell on deaf ears.  It was definitely a two person job but I tried working late to get things done only to get in trouble for \"working outside of assigned hours\" by boss 1.  This is after boss 2 chewed me out for not being on call 24 hours a day while they traveled, despite the fact that everything travel related\nhad\nto go through our travel department which wasn't going to spontaneously open at 3 am for boss 2.  So when I explained that the job was really work for two people I got the classic \"your predecessor didn't have a problem.\"  Predecessor was promoted after\nsix years\nof doing work and responding to emails, texts, and calls at 5:45 am or 11 pm and every time in between.  But boss 2 adored the predecessor for being on call 24/7 so I couldn't state the obvious flaw in both bosses  combined demands.'",
        "In response to 'Totally unreasonable.\nIf you want someone to be on call 24/7 then you cannot complain about them \"working outside hours\" and actually pay them to do so.\nIf they think your predecessor could do it better they are more than free to demote that predecessor back to your current position and see how much of problem that person doesn't have with the situation.', a user said: 'Thank you!  I completely agree.  Plus being available 24/7 is something that should have been mentioned in at least one of the seven interviews I had for the job.  I'm so happy that I'm done with that place.'"
