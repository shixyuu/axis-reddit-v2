        "In response to 'It's about making impact and just being present to upper management. Hard work alone never gets rewarded lol. That's why I leave at 10AM when I realize my superiors are not at work', a user said: 'Taking “you leave when the boss does” to a whole other level.\nHonestly respect, I worked for a tiny firm with no wfh and office closed at 5:30 not 5:00. The owner made a point that I’d leave at 5:30 on the dot during the slowest part of the year and how disrespectful it was to leave before him.\nNeedless to say I quit maybe 2 weeks later after what was probably 3 months of applying around.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'Only advice I give is be cautious when you “quiet quit”. I stopped trying at my last job and it got noticed before I got my current job. The owner was extremely unprofessional in how he handled my drop off in performance.'"
