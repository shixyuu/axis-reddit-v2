        "In response to 'This. It feels like propaganda to make people who are doing their jobs feel guilty about not going beyond what they’re paid to do.', a user said: 'It is 100% propaganda. Drives me nuts.\nWhat happens is lots of different media outlets jump on the trend and write about it or start using the phrase.\nThen you have people saying “it’s not nefarious. Look, this website writes about it and I like this website” — but journalists just need shit to write about, so they legitimise bullshit like this because they have to publish x number of articles.\nIt’s like manspreading. It was complete journalistic fabrication. Mansplaining, although arguably sexist, had some value when it was coined, to open up a discussion on gender/culture, but then some fool took it to stupidland with manspreading.\nI don’t know where this quiet quitting buzzword came from exactly, but it seems journalists ran with it and legitimised what otherwise would have been scoffed at and ignored.'"
