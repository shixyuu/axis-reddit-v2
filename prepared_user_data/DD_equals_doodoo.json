        "In response to 'That sounds like he's gone beyond \" quiet quitting\" as that implies you do your job but not go above and beyond, which if you see that promotions and raises are not being applied based on merit I can understand, but this sounds like he's just not doing his job at all.\nThat said, this response sounds like the best way to handle it', a user said: 'I've seen it used to mean either. When people consciously quietly quit, they often start deleting parts of their normal job duties too. One of my managers had to print off a job description and highlight the very first bullet point on job duties for one of her quiet quitters.'",
        "In response to 'Nothing because quit quitting is a bullshit term that was invented to try and guilt workers about doing what they were hired to and nothing more.\nP.s: if you meant slacking then you should use slacking.', a user said: 'Alternative take - quiet quitting is just a rebranding of slacking. Very few office workers are actually working 40 hours a week. People notoriously overreport how much they work.'",
        "In response to 'God, please point me to these office jobs where you are working less than 40.  Iâ€™ll take a pay cut for that.', a user said: 'Gestures wildly everywhere.\nr/overemployed\nwould probably be a good start.'"
