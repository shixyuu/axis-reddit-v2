        "In response to '\"Centers\" or \"stations\" (assuming they're the same thing?) has always struck me as one of those things they talk about in grad school that simply doesn't translate to the real world.  I don't know, maybe suburban and rural schools have physically larger classrooms, but my room barely has enough space for the students/desks in their normal configurations.  I just have trouble envisioning how something like this could physically work.\nEven something like pulling a group for re-teaching (something which I'd love to do)... where?  Any time I've tried doing that it's this massive logistical hassle of having people switch seats and getting confused.', a user said: 'They work in kinder and prek ....I dunno how they work in other grades.\nStations are teacher directed - I decide the activity and success criteria. Centers are student led - free choice basically. In prek and kinder,  stuff like play and learn,  art,  manipulatives,  etc. I tend to pull them out on Friday or when I am too tired to plan anything or need time to catch up on paperwork or testing. Let the kids make the decisions for a while.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting could be the best thing for education. Everyone's definition of quiet quitting is different. Mine is not working outside of your contract ours. Work from 7am to 3pm and then you're done. No lesson planning outside of class, no chaperoning, no working gates unless it involves extra pay.\nWhen you ignore these boundaries, you overwork yourself, can't sustain the position, and you end up leaving the profession and in return your students lose a great educator.\nIf you can't do all the tasks a school asks for you to do during the day, that is not the fault of you, it is the fault of your boss requiring too much of you. If you continue doing these tasks outside of your hours you are effectively telling your admin that this is okay.\nWhen you put your value in working extra hours because it makes you feel like you are \"doing it for the kids\" you are doing the opposite long term. The precedent that teachers have to put so much time in outside of work is toxic and leads to teacher burnout. A shortage of teachers is not good for any educational system.\nI'd like to blame admin, government, or students but the easiest fix is in the teachers themselves. When we overwork ourselves, we effectively hurt education. Only work your hours and if you can't get your work done, let your admin know you don't have the time. Healthy work life balance can keep us going and bring more teachers into the profession.\nEdit: Sorry y'all. I didn't realize how problematic the term \"quiet quitting\" is. I am glad though that it brought some attention to the post which led to some good discussion. I will use a different term from here on out and I am happy a lot of you only work your hours or work your contract.', a user said: 'They are called boundaries. I started putting up boundaries - going home on time, leaving work at work - after lockdown/during hybrid and it's made all the difference.\nI'm not as emotionally invested either and oddly,  it makes classroom management easier when I can just shrug off the disruptions and feel no guilt or anxiety about giving out consequences or calling home. I left one of my five year olds out of a field trip today and when my principal tried to guilt trip me,  I told her she could take him if she wanted. (Spoiler - she didnt want.)'"
