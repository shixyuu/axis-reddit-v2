        "In response to 'They can’t ask him to work OT per the union contract, he’s only allowed to volunteer to work OT. His boss was trying to get OP to volunteer to work the shifts without DIRECTLY being asked to, since that would violate the contract.', a user said: 'In all honesty this is as good as them asking OP to work OT. I would be going to my rep with this.'",
        "In response to 'I don't think I would do that. I think the OP handled it perfectly. They know the rules as well as he does.\nThey tried to bait him, and he baited them right back. I get the impression that he was polite and professional about it.\nJust getting up and heading back to things as normal is literally the equivalent of of giving them the middle finger without doing anything.\nI like to call it \"quiet fingering\".', a user said: 'Is the fact that they’re attempting to make people work OT they don’t want to work that the rep should be aware of. OP got himself out of it but other employees might not be able to, or feel pressured in to it. If the rep is aware, they can shut that shit down.'"
