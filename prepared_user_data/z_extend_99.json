        "In response to 'Depends on who it is. Example ay yung co worker ko. His salary stands at 45k a month but his work is mediocre at best and nobody liked him. When we had trouble financially and had to lay off workers, he was among those who had to go. I replaced him 2 months later. Quiet  quitting has been used as a scapegoat by many people who are just lazy and just want to \"enjoy their life\", not knowing that their actions would eventually bite them in the ass, having no money at all should times get rough.', a user said: 'How do you define and measure mediocrity? Slacking at work is not bare minimum. If the quality and value of your work goes below the standards, metrics, and parameters set by your working environment or field, that's not the bare minimum. You're going below the minimum.\nAnother thing. I've seen valuable team members from junior to senior positions get laid off arbitrarily on my entire career. What you're claiming about layoffs is not always true. Even if you're one of the top performing employees, you're fair game.'"
