Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'Apparently the term quiet quitting should just be called doing your job. Why would anyone do more if you continue to get paid the same amount? If you pay me accordingly then yes I will have no problem doing my best but also don’t ask me to do more because the company doesn’t want to hold others accountable or doesn’t want to hire the right amount of people for the job. Do more with less is something that should happen in special circumstances, it should not be the standard.'"
