        "In response to 'When did pagers become a thing?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager\nPayphones were a thing as well.\nI type the above as I have memories of the look on Dad's face when he came home with his newly-assigned pager in the 1970s. Couple that with the sour face he made at the local pool when his pager went off and he had to use the payphone to call in and see what was the emergency. While trying to hear over the screaming kids enjoying a nice summer day at the pool.\nSo this work-creep into our off time has been going on for much longer than the 1990s' innovations.\nI'm not saying this isn't a fight worth fighting by any means, just saying we've been slowly losing this battle for a very long time. ;)', a user said: 'Oh no... How did my pager end up in the pool..???'"
