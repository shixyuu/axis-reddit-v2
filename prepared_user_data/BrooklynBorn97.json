        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'I quit 5 Jobs in the last 9mos. I'm dead SRS, well the last job I got fired cause I flipped out on a supervisor and manager about them owing me 20$ for 2 hours of travel pay.\nCock suckers tried me. they ended up paying me and firing me cause I flipped shit.\nI think we need more employees like me tbh I think things would change lol'",
