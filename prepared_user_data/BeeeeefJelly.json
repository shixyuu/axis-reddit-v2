        "In response to 'I remember years ago I was browsing a drug forum and saw a post from this banker or entrepreneur in San Francisco\nBasically he had taken a dose of LSD or mushrooms(it was his first time) and afterwards felt like it had damaged his motiviation drive. He said he worked his ass off during his teenage years to get a good education, and then worked 100 hour weeks to get his great paying job(like 500k a year job).\nBut after taking the psychedelics, he no longer wanted to push himself to work long hours and he felt tired all the time. He wanted to know if his symptoms were psychosis from LSD, and how long heâ€™d recover. He blamed the drugs for his now lack of motivation to work 100 hours a week', a user said: 'That makes a lot of sense. It's easier to write off the experience as \"crazy drug\" rather than accept that you now view all your years of hard work as a waste.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Jimbo is quiet quitting I figured it out. Jimbo must be reading all the employment news and latched on to the new cool catchphrase in the media. He figures he doesn't have to make the best choices or do any more work than that contractual minimum. If he shows up on time and has all the appearance of coaching he can still be paid.', a user said: 'Wasn't he way ahead of this \"trend\" at FSU his last year or two there?'"
