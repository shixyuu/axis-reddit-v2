        "In response to 'The entire premise of the 4 day work week is that you don't cram your 5th day into the remaining 4. That defeats the purpose and will likely cause even more stress, fatigue and burnout as workers are working LONGER stints every day with only a single day's extra recovery. That's not feasible.\nThe point is to make workers happier and thus more productive. Giving them an extra day off without changing the remaining days, achieves this.', a user said: 'So it's four 8 hour shifts.'"
