        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'I think working hard is important but only in the context that it is for yourself that you work hard. Such as your own business or to feed yourself and get through life.\nWorking hard for the company used to pay off but these days I don't think it does. I've never worked corporate but I assume it's the same in most places. We work to get paid a certain salary but I find that the idea of \"we are a family/we must help each other\" is very abusive if your employer is exploiting short staffing to save on cost.\nMost corporates do this without recognition or sufficient reward. When you need to keep your job in these case, I find that quietly quitting is very self sustaining and shows you care about yourself and respect your time. If you don't respect yourself, no one will.'"
