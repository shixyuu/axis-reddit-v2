        "In response to '100% this. Schedule in some half-days early on. Slow down the pace. Sit at a cafe and watch the world go by for an afternoon. Sit on the beach and read a book for a few hours. Slow it dowwwn.', a user said: 'Yeah some of my favorite memories traveling have been \"off\" days. I remember in Istanbul taking my time to get up in the morning, Ayasofya visible from my 2nd floor hostel bed across the street. Everyone else already long out for the day. Slowly ambled out across Sultanahmet Park towards a cafe. Picked up a copy of the International Herald Tribune. Was pursued across the park by a dedicated rug salesman that I had seen in a rug shop a few days before. Hilarious; I hadn't really believed the stories I had heard about the persistence of Turkish rug salesmen! Relaxed at the cafe for a few hours watching the world go by. Didn't really rev up until the evening on the top floor bar at the close by Backpacker's Hostel. Belly dancers night. Went dancing and drinkly around Istanbul with new friends I met that night.'"
