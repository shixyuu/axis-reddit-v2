        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'So the real answer is that it wasn't a thing, until a couple TikToks using the term got decent traction, which then turned into news outlets picking it up, who then made it feel like it was this hot new trend going around.\nMeanwhile, in reality, what happened was a big chunk of people saw the TikTok, went \"huh, that's interesting\", clicked the big heart button, and then discarded the idea from their memory to make room for something more useful.\nYou can look up \"quiet quitting\" on google trends to get a sense of this. It was barely a blip on anyone's radar until last month, and you can already start to see it dipping again. This happens a lot, and it's worth keeping an eye out so you're not letting media outlets shape the conversation.'"
