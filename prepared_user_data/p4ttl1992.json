Seems like common sense to me - why sign a contract to do X then do X + Y?', a user said: 'The only reward for hard work is more hard work.\nI worked for some cunts in the past that promised pay rises and all sorts of shit but never gave me anything for my back breaking work. Now I'm at a new place, keep my head down and do what I need to do at my job and its great, far less stress, far less sorting other peoples shit out on a day to day basis and I've also received a 5% rise this year without asking have another pay review in December and get a Christmas bonus? I was mugged off for 8 years....why did I stay at the old job for so long ðŸ˜°'"
