[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'Quiet Quitting : you've checked out mentally and emotionally to the job. You don't care about company initiatives, results, strategies etc. You aren't putting yourself forward for anything, and if asked to do something you will do the bare minimum and even the pride in your work falls.\nDoing what's required : exactly what it says on the tin. Your standard, your quality, and your commitment remains the same and you still respect the job. But if someone tells you to work late they had better dangle something in front of you.\nEasy way to tell the difference; fast food restaurant worker discovers someone has vomited in the toilets. Quiet quitter doesn't report it, and just gets back to working behind the tills cos its someone else's problem. Doing whats required let's everyone know they are cleaning it up, but will moan about it while they do it.'"
