        "In response to 'It’s boomers gaslighting. Now they are out of workforce. They have nothing left in terms of an identity. They spent so many years working hard, missing events, family, hobbies, and friends. For what? nothing.\nEdit: I’d like to note that I did make blanket statement about boomers I’m well aware that’s it’s not all of them. It’s just from what I have noticed and personally experienced it’s about 8/10 of them. To the 2/10 that are not assholes, Thanks for being cool and having empathy.', a user said: 'no seriously, so many boomers are so salty because their job was their life and now they see younger generations living their own lives and placing work 2nd and it infuriates them'"
