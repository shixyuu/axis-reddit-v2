        "In response to 'I’ve known about this for a while, and thank you for the write up! I wanted a confirmation from a person I didn’t know personally.\nI think the lockdowns hurt China way more than any other country and it made things way way worse. It made a lot of the world divest from China. Making unemployment even worse than it was prior. I think the CCP expected a different outcome of the event, but got the rude awakening as of recently. The real estate bubble there is outrages, but definitely didn’t know they no longer employ older people in construction. Real Estate is like that in Hong Kong and Macau as well. The difference being that there the populations are smaller, so it’s not as noticing to the public. This is going to get spicy and if some of you have looked at the currency swaps of USD and YUAN it’ll make a lot more sense. Stack cash and wait, cause we are going to see a big drop in everything.', a user said: 'Appreciate the further insight and advice to watch out below. So SPY 500 Calls then?'",
        "In response to 'Nothing really shocking to me but it was an interesting read.\nI'm not sure that there is an automatic translation of this into political unrest though. I mean things were probably a lot worse than this back in the 60s.', a user said: 'If you mean the 1960s in China, then yes, because they had a giant cultural revolution that was characterized by uprising and violence. I feel like the current situation doesn't have to play out that way, but it's certainly the right ingredients for the recipe.'"
