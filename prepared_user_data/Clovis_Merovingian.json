        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'My\nquiet quitting\nera quietly ended with a large promotion and a $50k payrise. Funny how a bit of extra cash can turn the Xbox controller into a paperweight.\nThe free time (4-5 hours of Xbox a day while “working”) is missed and was a golden age of modern slacking. But then reality kicked in. The extra money brought more stability, options, a few life upgrades for my family.'"
