        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'While it sounds like students aren’t using this term correctly bc they aren’t employed, it makes me happy that younger generations are becoming aware of how capitalism and corporations are exploiting workers. It’s a great dialect starter about workers rights that they’ll need for the future.'"
