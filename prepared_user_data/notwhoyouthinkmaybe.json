        "In response to 'Has anyone here ever worked somewhere, had a supervisor quit, then had to do the supervisor's job, but while being told they can't actually make you officially the supervisor yet, just so they don't have to give you a pay rise? I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'I have a supervisor that doesn't know his job and even worse is unlikable; I was doing his job while being the go to person for junior employees. I have stopped doing that and am watching him flail while the area falls apart and people quit.\nSucks, but I couldn't keep being yelled at for not doing my job, because I was doing his.'"
