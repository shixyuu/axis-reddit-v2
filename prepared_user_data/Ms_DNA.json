        "In response to 'Yep, once a company's stock is traded in the stock exchanges, it can only be evil and worthless as an employer and as a participant of society.\nIt's not optional, depending on the management or can be more or less evil, but being evil is compulsory as what they have to achieve  (eternal growth) is absolutely impossible by normal means.\nIt's also absolutely impossible by being nasty jerks, but it helps to keep bonuses a bit higher for a bit longer.\nWelp, there's no helping it, but as employees it should remind us loyalty to these evil entities is foolish...', a user said: 'Hooooooboy this is so true. I worked for a company whose business took off during Covid (no travel + no restaurants + stimulus = $$ for fancy things that are well marketed). They went public in 2021. Their most expensive product ever (2X their previous most expensive product) came out in March 2022. Layoffs started in July 2022.\nThey went from amazing culture, promoting a decent work/life balance, lots of cool swag for new hires & birthdays, etc., lots of pretty lavish parties, amazing Christmas party… Then end of ‘21 into ‘22 all that just stopped. People started leaving right before the layoff. The culture that they would brag about and that got them on the list of Best Employers in the State was gone.\nAll from going public. Sure, there were external challenges but the combination of irrational exuberance and going public is what quickly eliminated an entire company’s culture.'"
