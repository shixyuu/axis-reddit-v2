        "In response to 'also with the land. the og 3 were paying from their pockets. until christine walk away. kody and robyn are paying from family fund. kody and robyn get 1/2? and they get 1/2? (maybe if not less) plus their 250k in bad art: jewelry galore and guns? the 1.5m dollar home. the new cars. IDK i can't even girl math that right. kody saying i paid for one lot on my own. with family money? no baby you didn't. those trailers are full of failed business... yip, bet they are.', a user said: 'Drives me crazy! They don’t get half they get 1/3. If they break up, they split the entire thing. Why do they think Robyn gets paid twice? Why wasn’t his money split 4 ways with each household getting an equal share?  He had four families to support. If I were Meri and Janelle, I’d ask how it was possible for Robyn to pay her mortgage, buy her kids cars, pay for college, and buy all the crap in that house. It is insane.'",

I guess that’s where Kody gets the idea that it’s okay to cheat the OG3 out of their due.'"
