        "In response to 'It baffles me how your laws permit this. Where I live it’s illegal to reduce a person’s salary once they have been registered. They would need to fire and re-hire  you with a lower salary to accomplish that, but doing so is considered unjustified dismissal so it gives you ground for legal complaints.\nIt sucks to have you doing quiet quitting a week into the new job, but at least you know that things won’t be getting any better so you can move on with looking for another job.', a user said: 'It’s because America’s leadership was purchased by big companies. In fealty (or because they’re from that world), they made laws that helped CEOs and hurt workers. They killed programs that kept companies in check and allowed them to run like greed-on-wheels.\nIn the 1950s none of this would have been possible. Ironically, this is the time frame referred to when those that keep this shit locked in say “make America great again”.\nIt’s a t-shirt slogan. They have no intention of doing what’s necessary.\nAnd they don’t teach long term vision in business anymore. It’s “get in, get yours for as long as you can, then get out when it starts to inevitably turn or you get bought out.”'"
