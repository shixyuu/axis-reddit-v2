        "In response to 'Original Post: Psychedelic mushrooms and quiet quitting: Psilocybin use tied to working fewer overtime hours [External Link]: https://www.psypost.org/2023/09/psychedelic-mushrooms-and-quiet-quitting-psilocybin-use-tied-to-working-fewer-overtime-hours-213829', a user said: 'https://www.npr.org/2021/05/17/997462169/thousands-of-people-are-dying-from-working-long-hours-a-new-who-study-finds\nMaybe they aren't quiet qutting but just health conscious.\nWorking long hours poses an occupational health risk that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, the World Health Organization says.\nPeople working 55 or more hours each week face an estimated 35% higher risk of a stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from heart disease, compared to people following the widely accepted standard of working 35 to 40 hours in a week, the WHO says in a study that was published Monday in the journal Environment International.'",
        "In response to 'The article said people that used shrooms worked an average of 3.6 fewer minutes of overtime during the week. Minutes. Not hours. I don't think 3.6 minutes is enough to improve health. That's like the difference between clocking out at your desk and clocking out when you walk out the door', a user said: 'Oh my response was more of snark about the study itself.  The lets blame drugs for people not wanting to work overtime mentality. Honestly the whole lets find every reason in the world to blame people for not wanting to work to their detriment for the benefit of their employer. For every study published gaslighting workers, you can find one that shows they shouldn't.\nCoupled with the mentality of lets ignore the medical benefits of x, y, or z drug because of moral perceptions and i was feeling pretty flippant.'"
