        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I deliberately do the majority of my 'strenuous' activities up front. For example, I went to the UK for 5 weeks - the first 3 weeks I traveled up and down the west coast of Scotland, toured the Outer Hebrides, went to Edinburgh and then York. Lots of hiking, walking around, tours, etc.\nBy the end of that I was pretty worn out, but the last 2 weeks of the trip I was at a comfortable hotel in London. Aside from going to the Globe, I deliberately hadn't planned\nanything\n. I had a list of things I\ncould\ndo that sounded interesting, but I went in with the mindset that if I did nothing but sit around the hotel and maybe venture out for a walk once in a while, that would be fine. It helped my mental state a lot! Of those last two weeks, probably 4 or 5 days I did nothing but watch trashy British TV and take London Walks tours, but I still did a ton of stuff on the days that I had energy to do so.'"
