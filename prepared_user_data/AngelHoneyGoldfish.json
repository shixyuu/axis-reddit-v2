        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I don’t hear “quiet quitting”, I hear “setting boundaries”.  I started doing this 2 years ago and it made a HUGE difference. I no longer cry all the time or think about work 24/7 after I go home'"
