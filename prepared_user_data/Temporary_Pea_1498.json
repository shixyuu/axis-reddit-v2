        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I'm doing it, but I'm not calling it quiet quitting, for the reasons PPs have outlined.\nLast year I was on the district SEL committee and I led my building's team. I naively believed the administration when they said this initiative would be fully supported, and that teachers would have all the tools they needed to be successful with it. Spoiler, they don't. I truly believe in the benefits of a comprehensive SEL program, but I'm not running myself ragged trying to get this off the ground when the people in charge don't actually give a fuck and are just doing it to check off a box.\nSo I took myself off the committee and freed up all that time and headpiece for things I can actually accomplish.'"
