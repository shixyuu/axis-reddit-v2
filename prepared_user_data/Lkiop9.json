        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. ðŸ’ª', a user said: 'Lol you think youâ€™re doing something but now you have no job, canâ€™t collect unemployment, and based upon your previous job, you wonâ€™t have a good reference and probably will just end up in another minimum wage job.\nQuite quitting only works when everyone does it at once and you can force the company to give you more money to come back, but believe it or not, they have already replaced you and you have only pushed more work and made it harder for your new old coworkers who probably couldnâ€™t quit because they have real bills and people relying on them to bring home the bacon!'"
