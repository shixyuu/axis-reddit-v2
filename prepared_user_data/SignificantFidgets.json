So the actual money amount didn't matter so much. Plenty of people are in much worse shape.', a user said: 'It sounds as if they didn't fully realize they made less money until they saw their tax form.\nHow can that be the case? It sounds like they worked less (less summer teaching) - they certainly knew they weren't teaching the summer class(es), right? Work less supplemental tasks (like summer teaching) and get paid less. There's really no issue with \"less pay\" - the issue is less work assignments.'"
