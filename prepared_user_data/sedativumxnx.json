        "In response to 'this is how i operate at work. i make just enough to keep my head barely above water, with essentially no capacity to save money at all.\n\"the only reason i'm here is because of the pay, the company has negotiated with me and with the union to make that pay as low as it can get it, and so the result is my income is barely adequate. in return,\nso is my work.\n\"', a user said: 'The detail about no saving money capacity hit me right in the gut. I think companies, especially big ones, thrive on that. Especially when inflation is high, or some political bullshit starts going on. Kinda makes sense, since politicians, almost universally, are elected by the big businesses in those respective places, or they actually run those businesses themselves. What I'm trying to say is I'm pretty sure at this point we're completely and utterly screwed, from multiple points of view.'"
