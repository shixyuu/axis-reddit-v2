If I could get paid the same\nTo be an IC as I could to be a manager I would pick being an IC everytime. It is much much easier and substantially less pressure. Coming from some that has done both in the same line of work basically now just managing what I used to do. I’d much rather do the shit I used to do without managing at the same pay band I’m at now.', a user said: 'you’ve been working for 20 years and have never been a manager?\nYou're dragging bystanders into this fight with that kind of generalization.\nTrained to lead soldiers, I do NOT need to manage princessy nerds for my daily bread. So I've never been a manager as such either and I'm happy to contribute individually and gtfHome.'"
