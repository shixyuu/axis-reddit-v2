They keep it open-ended so that they can shove anything up your ass that they want and you have no choice but to take it or find another gig.', a user said: 'Yeah, seriously. Currently I’m trying to find another job… I was hired as a graphic designer at my current gig, but I haven’t done a single graphic design job. All I do is put stickers on metal to make real estate signs. My boss the other day yelled at me because he “thought i had more experience”. Uh, yeah… I have experience as a graphic designer lol, not a sign maker. He just switched my job without even informing me.'"
