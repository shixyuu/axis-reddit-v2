The funny thing is, is that the owner of the company I worked for says all the dumb shit like \" nobody wants to work anymore\" meanwhile he's got a crew of 20 guys, putting in 50-60hrs week 6-7 days a week (travel work)- literally all they do is work!  I mean, he pays really well once you gain the skills, starting pay is $25 plus per diem, ot, and dt.  Foremen are making $42/hr- you just need to find someone willing to trade their life for that.\nAnd buddy, it ain't worth it for how shit the industry is these days...'"
