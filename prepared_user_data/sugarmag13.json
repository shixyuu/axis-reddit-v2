        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'omg how many times do we have to stop asking people to use this phrase?\nWORKING to contract\nworking for what you are paid for'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Funny\nI've actually helped negotiate them for about 15 years. I know what's in them and the wording, but thanks for your snark.\nMany of them DO NOT say \"x hours per week with additional responsibilities deemed necessary by management\"\n32 years and never had 1 say that. Always a union state.  We work to our contracts all the time, but thanks for the opinion.'",
        "In response to 'Mine doesn’t stipulate my hours and does say “extra duties as assigned.” But I’m in Texas and we don’t have unions. It sucks here.', a user said: 'Texas, Florida, and some others that are Red states or no unions have shitty contracts in a lot of places. I understand that and do not know how people work there'"
