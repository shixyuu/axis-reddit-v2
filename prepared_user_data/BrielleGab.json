As someone who has gone through this personally, you never want to do this without your partner along side of you. It shows lack of respect and faith. It is awful to the person that is supposed to be your equal in life.', a user said: 'Right? We are sitting here talking about how \"OMG RED FLAGS SHE WON'T TALK TO HIM\" when your partner flipped their shit at their job? She is rightfully pissed that he made a decision in a fit of anger that could have significant repercussions on their finances and his career. I would be upset too and need some time to cool down. That is a reasonable response folks, not losing your shit.'"
