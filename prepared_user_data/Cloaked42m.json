I learned a long time ago that you get the same 2.5% raise as everyone else regardless.', a user said: 'Importantly, you are actually HARMING your organization if you end up doing the work of 2 or 3 people.\nYou will, eventually, move on.  You might get a better gig.  You might move so your kids have better opportunities.  You might get hit by a bus.\nYour company is then going to have to replace you... and find out they can't.  They'll have to get 3 full time people to replace one person.  This is no bueno.\nThis isn't 'quiet quitting' or 'working your wage'.  This is common sense.  Do a good job, but don't put in unpaid hours, EVER.  Don't do undocumented work.  EVER.\nDon't be a single point of failure.'",
        "In response to 'just quit coming to work without telling anyone\nThis is in fact the original definition of quiet quitting, as I heard it.', a user said: 'I assumed it was showing up to work, but not actually doing anything.\nI was pretty surprised when it turned out to mean \"Do what you are actually supposed to do and what they hired you for in the first place.\"'",
        "In response to 'Watch it, I was a CAB committee member for a long time. They were boring meetings that made you want to blow your brains out. I was the wild child. Anytime another member would have some BS reason to turn something down, I would immediately perk up and simply ask, \"Why?\" so many times people would stutter, etc. If there is no GOOD reason to stop something, don't. Do. Not. Hinder. Progress.\nSo many times the response would be \"Well, we have always done it like this... *ramble off some completely inefficient method of handling the problem, with head shakes and all*\"\nUsually I would just say \"Well obviously that way is no longer working.\"\nMan this brought up hidden rage of sitting through CAB meetings.\nOn the other side of the coin, at my current company I am working on implementing a change management process, because well, wild west doesn't work either.\nEdit: Along with the main topic, when I left the above job, I wrote a 1 line resignation:\nHR fucks you at every chance they get.\nIt wasn't even me, it was other people. A stellar employee we had was promoted. Oh, but lets put him at the absolute lowest pay we can for the promotion, 5k is a lot to him! Even though he should be mid-high on the pay scale and be getting a 20k raise.\nOh we changed our vacation policy to be more open. Oh, sorry people that just passed the seniority threshold, you have to wait another year before you can take advantage of it.\nThis employee keeps getting made fun of for his weight and reporting it to us! Let laugh about it and give the people doing it no repercussions! (I got this guy a job elsewhere)\nSeriously, fuck HR departments.', a user said: 'Well, we have always done it like this\nATOMIC-RAGE.GIF\n\"Yes sir, that's why  you suck and can't keep employees.\"'"
