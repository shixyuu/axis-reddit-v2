        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'I agree. she gave way more in the early seasons. it's ridiculous now that all we get are staged convos outside. the conversations happening outside even if the weather is bad makes it so obvious she has severely limited filming in their home lol. I'm so curious what she actually does all day? at least with Christine these past few years have been busy - buying a new home, decorating it, meeting and dating David, all the various wedding planning and parties. Janelle was splitting time between North Carolina and Flagstaff. Meri had the bnb, has friends, and likes to travel. what does Robyn do???? what is a typical day like for her? we never see it'"
