While I was running a team of 20+ people around the globe (and that was too much, to be honest), boss gets a bright idea that we need people to volunteer to work weekends to provide more support. I said nobody would volunteer for extra hours, even with pay -- People value their time off and if the company wants weekend coverage, they need to budget and hire for it. Boss said, if nobody will volunteer, then they have to be voluntold. Nope. Tell them yourself. But be prepared for a wave of defections to other companies that don't put those burdens on their workers.\nWe got lucky. Three years later, there are still no weekend shifts except from people who've actually been hired to do that work. But they keep pushing. Every day.\nIt's important to draw a line and help managers understand that burn-out is real and won't help anyone.'"
