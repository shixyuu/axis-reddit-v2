        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is declining—45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'My personal opinion in recent years of all these studies and articles and such about quiet quitting is this. We as a world, not just country or business or individual or whatever, need to accept that both humans and business cannot forever improve and grow at a linear and constantly rate. It’s just not realistic and we need to stop trying to force that. Since the pandemic the world has been pushing for more and more and more efficiency, production, etc, even more so than usual. People are still physically and mentally recovering from the pandemic, inflation brought on by the pandemic and general economy struggles, we now face more struggles manufactured by the current administration, all while raises and money in paychecks continues to dry up as prices increase dramatically (unless you job hop which most do not do). Also job security is very poor for many right now and home ownership is out of reach for most who don’t already own. Politicians and business need to slow it down if they want long term performance instead of keeping people in a place of constant burnout and poor performance. Having a few quarters of moderate sustainable performance to let people breathe and relax a bit, increasing pay one time well above market average to make up for the lost money to inflation and tariffs and such for workers, and increasing time off even with just one or two extra weeks would make a huge deal tbh'"
