        "In response to 'Ppl that use \"unskilled work\" to justify paying ppl less than they need to sustain their life are scum. That being said, unskilled is still a valid description for certain types of work. Stocking shelves at a supermarket for instance. Its important work and someone has to do it, no doubt. And that someone shouldnt have to chose between food and heating. Nevertheless, it is work that doesnt require special skills so its unskilled work. Unskilled =/= useless or unimportant.', a user said: 'Agreed. Everybody should be paid enough to live without worrying about where their meals are coming from, but the idea that there is no difference between skilled and unskilled labour is just nonsense. If I can learn your job in an afternoon, the value of that labour is intrinsically worth less than a profession that takes years to learn.'"
