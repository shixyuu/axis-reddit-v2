A lot of the time, he gets overwhelmed and tired and gets SLOPPY and I have to clean up after him or coach him on how to do certain processes effectively.', a user said: 'Stop doing this:\nA lot of what I do also involves cleaning up messes created by my manager, who means well but doesn't have a great attention to detail.
