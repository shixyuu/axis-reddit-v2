[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'Gods I wish I could work my wage, but it would put the safety of others at risk. I work in childcare, and while I have an administrative position, I’m still doing the duties of my previous position before I was promoted. I’m doing the job of two people, for no reward. It’s excruciating.\nY’all who can do this? Please do it. Do your job as stated in your list of duties and nothing more. No one deserves to be used for free labor when their employer needs to hire more people (or for any reason, really).\nQuiet quitting and working your wage are synonymous. It’s nothing new, but it’s important. Do your job, don’t take shit from higher ups, that’s it.'"
