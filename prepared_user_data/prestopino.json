There’s a video on if boomer’s stole their children’s future, and it says it very aptly: “you can’t run an economy on people waiting to have enough money to start their lives.”\nPeople will have fewer or no children if they don’t have a place to house them or don’t have enough money (because other expenses take too much of their income) to afford them.\nPeople might delay having kids, but if too many people people delay into too late in their lives it means less people being able to naturally conceive and many will be unable to have kids because they can’t afford fertility treatment.', a user said: 'This is why I believe that if there is no crash now, Millennials will still be left holding the bag when we get older.\nReal estate can't appreciate if there are no buyers. The economy can't grow with a declining population.'",
