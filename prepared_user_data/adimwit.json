        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule\nIt's a strategy used by unions as an alternative to strikes or slowdowns. This has been a thing for decades.\nAn example might be that your employer rule book requires you to come in on time, but your manager asks you to come in an hour early for prep work. Work to rule means you come in exactly when you're scheduled to work, which in turn means no prep work gets done and it delays the opening of the business.\nIt also means following all safety rules to the letter. A lot of companies will ignore safety rules or encourage bypassing safety measures to improve production. OSHA requires companies to train workers on all equipment that is essential to their job. If your company doesn't provide you any kind of training (like on a pallet jack or a ladder) you have a right under OSHA to refuse to do any work associated with those tools. That can cause trucks to not get unloaded or shelves to not get stocked. Since OSHA specifically has a requirement that you get trained on these tools, your employer can't retaliate or discipline you.\nThe goal is to disrupt the business to the point that they pay you more to get you to improve productivity.'"
