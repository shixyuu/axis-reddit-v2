You sort if slowly fade out without all the faff of disassociation and getting shunned. You still have friends to contact if need be. My grandparents seem to be doing it at the moment. Sometimes attend meetings on zoom, mostly don't. Never on the ministry anymore. Occasionally elders pop by to check up on them after their lack of attendance and they blame old age and Ill health but...they're fine. They seem to do other things fine. I think it's just a good excuse to avoid the faff of what comes from fully leaving'"
