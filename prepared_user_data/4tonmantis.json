At my first job, I used to show up early and stay a little after 5. Wore a suit every day. People thought i was the most productive guy ever, getting a shitload of work done. Reality? I maybe put in 10 hours a week and spent most of the day studying for my masters classes.', a user said: 'That's like George costanza leaving his car at work for a couple of weeks,Â  and his bosses think he is coming in early and staying late ðŸ˜„'"
