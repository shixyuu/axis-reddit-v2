        "In response to 'As an organised form of protest against working conditions it was historically called work to rule. The cynic in me belive the rebranding is an attempt to demonize a valid way of organised labour to advocate for their rights. Working to the rules sounds reasonable and good, quiting but still getting paid sounds bad.', a user said: 'One of the great mistakes that people often make is to think that any organisation called 'National Rifle Association' is a branch or chapter of the National Rifle Association of America. This could not be further from the truth.\nThe National Rifle Association of America became a political lobbying organisation in 1977 after the Cincinnati Revolt at their Annual General Meeting. It is self-contined within the United States of America and has no foreign branches.\nAll the other National Rifle Associations remain true to their founding aims of promoting marksmanship, firearm safety and target shooting. This includes the original\nNRA\nin the United Kingdom, which was founded in 1859 - twelve years\nbefore the NRA of America. It is also true of the\nNational Rifle Association of Australia\n, the\nNational Rifle Association of New Zealand\n, the\nNational Rifle Association of India\n, the National Rifle Association of Japan and the National\nRifle Association of Pakistan. All these organisations are often known as \"the NRA\" in their respective countries. The British\nNational Rifle Association\nis headquartered on Bisley Camp, in Surrey, England. Bisley Camp is now known as the National Shooting Centre and has hosted World Championships for Fullbore Target Rifle and F-Class shooting,\nas well as the shooting events for the 1908 Olympic Games and the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The National Small-bore Rifle Association (NSRA) and Clay Pigeon Shooting Association (CPSA) also have their headquarters on the Camp.'"
