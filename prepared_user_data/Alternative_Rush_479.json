        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'Sobbyn was full metal effort when she was preaching to the kids and basking in Kody's choice to be with her anytime he could. She happily denied Meri and opportunity to go to college; she gleefully painted Christine and her kids (literally) out of a family portrait with Kody and inserted her own; she made sure Janelle's kids knew that the food in a family owned fridge and the food paid for by the other wives was hers. She happily accepted Kody melting down Meri's wedding ring.'"
