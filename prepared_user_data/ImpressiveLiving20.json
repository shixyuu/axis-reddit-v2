        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Capitalism needs to hurry the fuck up and die already, that’s what I think of all this bullshit. But real talk, I’ve been “quiet quitting” by not waiting longer than the 15 minutes that the wait policy states I have to for one of my cases (I’m a BT—behavior therapist—that goes to peoples houses to provide services to kids with needs) and one of the parents told me I was unprofessional for not waiting longer than that. Not my problem they refuse to be on time to session and straight up are fucking around to see what they can get away with. They refuse to ask to start sessions later beforehand so they can trap me at their house and force me to wait around for them as if I’m some indentured servant for them or something. I’m just glad I put in my two weeks, I’m ready to never see those parents ever again.'"
