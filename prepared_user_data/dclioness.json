        "In response to 'Admin has made a number of decisions in the last two years that have amounted to several pay cuts and huge demands for more work. My response has been:\nTake service commitments only if they come with course release or stipend.\nSay yes to students but no to admin unless there is extra money involved (no volunteering for their pop up committees, town hall meetings, etc).\nRespond, but don't be proactive, especially if admin is about to shoot themselves in the foot. I've been around long enough to know when they're about to hurt themselves, but they don't want to hear that their idea isn't brilliant, so I just sit quietly while they break things.\nSkip everything optional.\nResearch what would be interesting to me anyway, even if it wasn't published.\nUse every perk of the job to comfort myself: all the CE money, any scheduling flexibility, etc.\nRemember that this isn't forever and have a back up plan.\nI hope we all find a way through!', a user said: 'Excellent list. Mine also includes \"don't do anything that only counts for someone else's metrics.\"'"
