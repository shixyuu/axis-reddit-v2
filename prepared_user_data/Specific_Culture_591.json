You still go in and sit at your desk or whatever, collecting a paycheck, but you just sit around until they really do fire you.

        "In response to 'That's kind of a silly term then, because what he says and what it means are unrelated. Doing your work duties is not quitting, in any sense of the word.', a user said: 'Exactly. The guy who coined the term is a corporate recruiter and business manager/owner coach so that tells you exactly where his thought processes are.'",
        "In response to 'Joining this sub has made me appreciate my Union here in Philly- all those “extras” that you described would be at a hourly rate and not out of the kindest of my heart - good for you !!!!! Reclaim your time', a user said: 'In California, our PTO handled all those things… and admin helped.'"
