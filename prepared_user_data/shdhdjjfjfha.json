        "In response to 'If someone isn’t willing to take on more but wants more and more money, its a sensible decision. You said it yourself basically. You’re advocating for people staying in the same role doing the same work and nothing else…all while getting big pay bumps to stay. You could hire a new person and get them up to speed within a year doing the same work for significantly less.', a user said: 'You’re using “big pay bumps” in place of “cost of living raises.” Is it because that makes your point sound reasonable? Kinda like how you took someone saying “do what you’re hired to do” and equated it to “doing the bare minimum\nor maybe even less.”\nDid you say that because you wanted to make it seem like someone “doing exactly what they’re hired to do” was somehow a bad thing?'"
