And of course it's on TikTok.\nQuiet quitting: The workplace trend taking over TikTok - BBC News\nKids today need to learn more about unions and industrial action.!', a user said: 'I've noticed that whenever a workplace has its annual review for employees, they are always graded on what extra things they've done, what above and beyond tasks they've completed. And if they haven't achieved those they are regarded as not working enough. But the actual job is rarely counted in those reviews. They should be graded on how well they did the job they are hired to do.'"
