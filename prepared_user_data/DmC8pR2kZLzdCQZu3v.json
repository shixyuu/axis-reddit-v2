        "In response to 'Original Post: My cousin is SFPD and has the same take on the bikers. Are we basically just paying them 3/4 $billion a year to cry and quiet quit? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/uhdkr8xy39ld1.jpeg', a user said: 'If you’re so concerned why don’t you actually rally to vote for DAs and judges who will actually hold up their end of the equation?\nI’m struggling to understanding… if cops arrested these people over and over and they keep getting let out without charges and every now and then someone dies or gets seriously injured in a chase, what exactly would your response be? That’s good enough? Or would you then, finally, complain like this guy about DA and judges and policy?\nI despise these bikers as much or more than anyone, and yet even I can acknowledge the authorities who actually have to interface with the assholes have a point, while the soft hands type away on Reddit'"
