        "In response to 'Question: why would you do more (or way more) than what you are paid for (the bare minimum)?', a user said: 'Some people take pride in their work. Also, some people realize that they have to work to make a living, and aren’t bitter about it.\nGoing above and beyond what you’re required to do shows that you respect your job and are looking to improve the place you work for…which is how you make yourself eligible for promotions and pay raises.\nYou may not even care about the place, but if you don’t have a wicked jumpshot or  the equivalent, this is how you increase your monetary/employment value.\nThere are women who work in my department for the last 25 years, and they are still making under $22 an hour, all because they would rather stay complacently packing croissants every day, instead of taking on more responsibility and getting promoted. I’ve been here two years, started at the base pay level, and I make more than all of them already.\nSpoilers: I do less “work” now that I am promoted, than I did when I was working out on the sales floor.'"
