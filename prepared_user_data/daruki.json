He said he worked his ass off during his teenage years to get a good education, and then worked 100 hour weeks to get his great paying job(like 500k a year job).\nBut after taking the psychedelics, he no longer wanted to push himself to work long hours and he felt tired all the time. He wanted to know if his symptoms were psychosis from LSD, and how long heâ€™d recover. He blamed the drugs for his now lack of motivation to work 100 hours a week'"
