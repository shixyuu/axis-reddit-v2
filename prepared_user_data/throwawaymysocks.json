Good on you.', a user said: 'Yeah I hate the term “quiet quitting” but just started a new job and decided that I’m not doing anything outside of contract hours. The new job uses a different email so I’m not setting it up on my phone so I literally won’t even see emails unless I’m at school. So freeing not to have to worry about anything.'",
        "In response to 'Yep, a few years ago!\nMy rule is, if it’s outside of my contract hours it has to either bring me joy or bring me enough money to make working late worth it. So far I’ve rarely stayed past contract.\nI do need to do some IEP meetings outside of contract, but decided not to die on that hill.\nEdit - I agree with the issues with the term “quiet quitting.” I don’t call what I’m doing quitting in any way. I work my ass off those contracted hours.', a user said: 'As a case manager I started scheduling IEPs only at the start of the school day so teachers aren’t working past contract hours in the afternoon. It’s not loved by everyone but it’s the fairest way to do it I think.'",
        "In response to 'By idea a parents schedule has to be taken in to consideration. Not all parents can do start of the day . In full disclosure that’s when I can do mine, 8 am', a user said: 'Our sped secretary does the scheduling but she asks what time case managers prefer meetings at and just goes with that. Most parents can make a once a year meeting work.'",
        "In response to 'Excellent, 8am Monday through Friday. That's five options.', a user said: 'Monday though Thursday. Speaking from experience but Friday IEPs are a ghost town.'"
