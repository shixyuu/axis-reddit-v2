        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'I’ve had a former supervisor at work tell me that “you shouldn’t be doing paperwork or responding to emails on the clock! That’s for when you are home sitting in front of the tv!” My next job in the same field told me “the fastest way to get fired is to reply to emails off the clock. We don’t want you working off the clock.” It was such a nice change.'"
