What I expect is people to give a shit and be part of the team. You don't need to go above and beyond, but I don't want someone who just ticks boxes. There are 1000s of potential employees that fit this category, there are only 10s who have the drive for growth and will get the pay rise with the responsibilities.\nI will have positions available in the coming months and years as we grow. I wan't to put the right people into these positions. My colleagues have been pissed at me as I got certain roles over them, they feel they deserve it because they have worked longer. Well, unfortunately they have done the absolute minimum required and never took time to grow themselves as a person, nor learn and grow professionally as the business evolves.\nAt the end of the day a job is a contract and an exchange for hours and money, but unless you work on progressing you are not going to progress. be it internally, or improving your skills and experience to take the next step elsewhere.'"
