Now I've been there for about a year, and it's a soul-sucking nightmare. My days get destroyed because I'll have something like 1 morning meeting and 1 afternoon meeting, and I end up just idling away the hours in between. I usually just surf Reddit or watch Netflix. Best case, I'll get in a workout or read.\nI'm quitting soon to go to an actual job, where they're going to pay me more money to do real work. I don't know if it's just because it's been years since I had to do actual work for multiple days in a row, but I'm weirdly looking forward to it.', a user said: 'You could always try to learn a new skill in your downtime, although honestly just being able to relax sounds nice as well. Helps ensure you’re not burnt out for your actual free time.'",
