        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'If you are the one that goes in early to make the coffee...\nBut you do it off the clock, quit doing that\nIf you are the one that cleans out the fridge every Friday, but it's not on your job description..\nQuit doing that\nIf you are the one that does the IT quick answer work even though IT work is not a part of your job description,\nQuit doing that\nIf you are bringing things in from home, whether extra decor for themes or parties, or basic office supplies, and paying with your own money,\nQuit doing that.\nBe sure that you are fulfilling your contract. The four walls of that contract are your job description.\nAnything extra that you do, make sure it is written down, and see if he can get compensation for it.\nIf not, quit doing that.\nYes, you can still be nice to your co-workers and bring in treats and share ideas.  But if you find that you are the only one bringing and treats and sharing ideas, quit doing that.'"
