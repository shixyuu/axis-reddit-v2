        "In response to 'R/overemployed is over there—> \ncheck it out 😂', a user said: 'I took 10 paper extensions to the IRS today, took an hour total.\nBilled each client 1 hour.\nSo I did “10 hours of billable time” in 1 hour.\nWhy am I billing it like that? Because if I took 1 of them in, I would have spend 1 hour regardless.\nTherefore.  17 hours in 1 day, essentially.\nWork smarter not harder meme'",
        "In response to 'You work 10 hours in 1 hour? That guy on TikTok who lives 4 days in 24 hours has got to go to your seminar!', a user said: 'It’s about as rediculously stupid as it sounds.\nBut I’m also nearing hour 40 and it’s fucking Wednesday  as is.  So fuck it.'",
        "In response to 'No chance. The way they hyper analyze realization, you’d never end up getting positive feedback, a raise, and bonus while quiet quitting.', a user said: 'My firm is run by complete buffoons.\nNo one cares about realization.\nI saw the timesheets of a coworker, 50% of the total billed time to a specific company was him “reviewing” intern prepared work which was 20% of the total billed time.\nTotal number of hours was 100 hours in project.\nNo way in hell the intern fucked it up so bad, you had to redo the entire project… twice.\nBefore he later gave it off to a\nreviewer\nhimself.\nI saw him prepare 1040s with no differences than last year (when he also prepared them) in 3-4x the amount of time.'"
