        "In response to 'If I were looking for a new position, I'd be willing to drop the fully-remote requirement, but you better believe I would expect extra compensation for it, and even then I'm going to continue looking for another fully remote position in the meantime.\nI'm an IT director, and management tried to take away my team's partial remote (one day per week) last week. I prepped a proposal over the weekend to demand a 20% raise to keep them from leaving, but the complaints had started immediately, and they re-instated the telework first thing this morning.\nEveryone in IT wants to be fully telework. If you're someone who doesn't mind working in the office, use that to your advantage to demand a higher wage right now. Especially considering the high cost of fuel, childcare, etc, and the shortage of people willing to work in the office, it's perfectly reasonable for companies to be paying a premium to in-person IT personnel.', a user said: 'One day a week is a joke'"
