The phrase is used by the oligarch class to suggest people should get blood from stones instead of what their JD says what they should do.\nYes there are cases where sometimes you need to go above and beyond, but if that sometimes is all the time then your management are exploiting you.', a user said: 'There's a difference between only fulfilling the requirements/ expectations of a role and actively doing the bare minimum to not get fired'",
        "In response to 'I dunno, maybe?\nIt was only 2 people, when you have clear deliverables and expectations, it’s easy to spot the people not doing any or very little work.\nAlong with a company wide ‘restructure’ unfortunately those people had put targets on themselves by showing we could still function without them', a user said: 'There's a difference between sacking someone for performance and redundancy... it is illegal in Australia to use performance for the basis of a redundancy. You make a position redundant, not the person. If there are multiple people in the same type of role, sure you do a skills matrix or have them interview off against each other, but yeah only a retard would make a person redundant over low performance. Then you can't rehire anyone into the same position lol.'"
