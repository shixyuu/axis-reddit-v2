        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Update: wow, the support!  Thank you all!\nWill now only refer to this as \"Just doing my job\"\nStarting today, I quit working for free.  I won't manage the school food pantry, sew for students or school programs ( uniform alterations, letter jackets, CTE jackets, prom dresses), work the gate or track meets, cover hall duty for others, support fundraisers, sponsor or coach teams, provide snacks to students, participate in staff potluck meals.\n I will arrive 2 minutes before my designated duty time and leave 2 minutes after hours.\nI will take off every Friday to help my family, and take off every PD because I have yet to attend a worthwhile PD (I have only been teaching since 2001, a valuable PD is unlikely to occur in the next year).\nI have 80+ days of leave accrued, and I will leave as few on the table as possible. \nThere is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.', a user said: 'Sounds like your still giving them 4 minutes a day for free! Lol.\nGood for you though! Employment contracts work both ways. It lays out expectations for the employee to follow. If they wanted more, it should be in your contract. Like other have said, you're not quiet quitting. You're working to expectations. I absolutely hate that term and how it has been used to shame people for working to expectations. If employers want more, they need to own up to it and ask for more.\nAs far as your PD comment, I stopped going to PD in 2017. I felt the exact same way. There was nothing I was learning and I could use my time better. Surprisingly, no one noticed. I guess monitoring PD is just as worthless as attending PD.'"
