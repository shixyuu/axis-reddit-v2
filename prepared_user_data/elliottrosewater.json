No, it's just work-to-rule â€” and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'Well I'm a career bartender and there are a lot of tasks not really explicitly stated in the job description, ie. General cleanliness tasks, taking care of drunk patrons, keeping an eye on shitty people/creeps, but they need to be done and there is noone else to do it. But with tips you make more than minimum wage(35-40 an hour) so we accept those things as part of the job. I think the restaurant industry is one of the worst for trampling worker's rights. I'm running my own bar, now, though so I'm trying to undo some of the toxic things I had when I was coming up.'"
