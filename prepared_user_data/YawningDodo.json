        "In response to 'Yup but those it can just not answer. Beepers were also a thing but expensive and not everyone got one. Plus they were a pain to use.\nCellphones are ubiquitous and its extremely easy to send a text.  Social media is too and some people are silly enough to have their bosses as freinds on it.\nIt is a hell of a lot easier to get a hold of people nowadays.  If a person called you back in the day and someone was on their dial up modem the person calling got a busy signal. That's it no contact. If someone was on the phone busy signal means no contact. Back in the day you used to have freaking cassette tapes to record on your answering machine.\nNow you can text, email, call ,whatsapp, and msg through social media to a device that people have on their person almost all the time. All with low effort.\nIt's not even close to what it used to be like.', a user said: 'This is why when I made the switch to freelancing I got a virtual phone number for my business and set it up to go straight to voicemail outside of my office hours. If it comes in outside of regular business hours, it can wait. I also close the tab with my work email when I quit for the day. I might occasionally still check things outside those hours if I feel like it, but I never\nrespond\noutside of regular business hours.\nAll that being said, at my last salaried job I did entrust my cell number to my boss because she was a reasonable person and I trusted her. In my eight years there, she only called me after-hours once and it was when the building literally flooded and it was all hands on deck to carry out our emergency plan (it was a museum, so...kind of important). That's how it should be; after-hours contact should only happen if you're being paid to be on-call (and have time when you're not) or if it's a true emergency.'"
