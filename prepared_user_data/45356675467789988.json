        "In response to 'Last year, when gas prices were rising, my org had an online meeting, followed by a Q&A. During the Q&A, one of my coworkers mentioned the rising CoL and inflation, and asked if we would be getting CoL raises.\nCorporate response off the cuff was 'We don't decrease your wages when inflation goes down, so we're not going to increase your wages as it goes up.'', a user said: 'Well there hasn't been annual deflation since 2009 and it was only .4% lol'"
