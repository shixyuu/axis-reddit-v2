        "In response to 'Original Post: TIFU and ragequit my job [Update 5 may, 12:00pm: Yes my wife is talking to me again. No, the company has not yet been in contact. I'm leaving now to drop off all my company-owned assets and badge. Wish me luck.]\n[Update 1:20pm: Thank you all for your concern, and whoever messaged the Reddit Cares folks - I'm okay. I've been working with professionals to improve my mental health for several years. This is a definite regression, but without the help I've already had, it would have happened much sooner, and much more spectacularly self destructive.]\n[Last update 7:35pm: It's the end of the day, and I'm not exhausted. I'm not short-tempered and grumpy. I'm actually in a good mood for the first time in a while. Thanks, everyone who had kind words. I'll keep reading and replying. It's not like I've got anything better to do with my time.]\n(Happened yesterday, for the pedantic.)\nI was on a Zoom call, waiting to give a presentation that was scheduled for a 15 minute slot. Three hours of listening to the presentations queued before mine, and it comes down to five minutes. \"Okay, I'll just speed through this, as nothing has changed, so it should be an easy approval.\"\nFirst slide. Second bullet. I'm interrupted.\nBy one of the committee who clearly hasn't read the proposal. Or any of the\nthree months\nof back and forth on the specific wording or implementation details, justifications and prior approvals.\nI try to drill down to the specific objection, even find the email thread where I was given that specific wording, and they ask for clarification on what, exactly, I'm looking to get approved. [What would you say... You do here?.gif]\nBackground: I'm building a script to automate some internal reporting tasks currently done manually. To do that, the script needs an API key. To approve use of the key requires this security review, to be sure the script is communicating and storing all its data securely. This final presentation,\n83 days\nafter the initial application, should be a rubber stamp. All the items in the application have been documented, action items responded to, amended, and given the go-ahead. The last change was over a month ago.\nSo, what am I here to get approval for? I need the committee's approval on my plan, because the security group who controls access to the API requires it to grant me API access, so I can build the script. The application lays out my plan to secure the data the script reports on. (Sidebar: To get the script plan approved also requires a complete review of the entire infrastructure plan of the server instance the script was going to run on. No joke.)  What am I here for? Ultimately, so the guy that grants the keys can check the box next to my request. What's the key for? Script needs it. Script needs documentation, approval. Documentation done, I'm asking for approval.\nI just want to write some code.\nYou tell me to get approval, fine. Tell me who to ask, and what assurances they need. Fine. Ask your questions, and I'll answer them. FINE. Just let me finish writing my code.\nThen, after three hours of listening to you drone on about details that are completely irrelevant to the other applicants' presentations - including questioning their business case for even building the proposed service in the first place - and you squeeze me in the last five minutes - and then interrupt me and talk over me and talk down to me (Sound familiar, ladies? Totally get it.) all because\nyou\nclearly haven't done the homework?\nI snapped.\nI said things that were inappropriate, rude, immature, insulting, potentially actionable, shouting and cursing and I don't even know what else. [I'm out of order? You're out of order! The whole trial is out of order!.gif]\nBut I've been out the door on this job for weeks. I've had my resignation letter written for a month. All I was waiting for was an offer from one of the dozens of job applications I've sent out. I fully planned to finish this project, put in my two weeks, quietly send out some goodbye emails, and fade away. [Homer disappears into the bushes.gif]\nBut nah.\nSo I clicked \"leave meeting\", queued up a bunch of emails, then went to pick up my kids from school. I was running a few minutes late.\nCareer-limiting maneuver? Absolutely. Selfish, short-sighted, impulsive. I'm better than that. I'm disappointed in myself and embarrassed. I didn't sleep last night, and ever since the call, I can't stop shaking. My heart is still beating so fast it's like some long, drawn out panic attack. I feel sick to my stomach and I can't sit still. My wife's not talking to me yet.\nBest thing I've ever done for myself.\nTL;DR: I've been ready to quietly quit my job for weeks, but a three hour Zoom call pushed me over the edge.', a user said: 'Was there about a month ago! A company I worked for for nearly ten years ! There is only so much you can take. Stress , physical and mental health , family, it’s not worth it!! For years I put my career in front of everything else . Ended up nearly divorced , health problems including a cardiologist and gastroenterologist, anxiety and depression , being so exhausted and emotionally and mentally unavailable for my children, the job was getting most of me while my family got the leftovers which was the suckiest parts . I snapped . I literally ended up in the fetal position in the back of my restaurant a few times. Threw things (including my stool at my desk) across the store the day I snapped and quit. Lashed out in anger at people and I do not have a temper. I am not that kind of person . All because my district manager was a POS and refused to help me . I was working 17-18 hours a day one day off sometimes no days off, having to take my children to work with me . I loved my job , my employees , and my customers and put in so much effort to my store. All I needed was a little help instead of being told every single day to figure it out and constantly being screamed at if my numbers weren’t perfect or if this wasn’t done or if that wasn’t perfect . When I left , I left with a bang and although I cried for a few weeks and to even drive by there I start shaking and almost panic , it was the best decision I have ever made. My marriage is back where it needs to be, my children are so happy, I get to take them to school , pick them up, tuck them in at night , that place was hell. Also, when I left , within a week so did everyone else , they refused to do it without me so now my ex district manager gets to FIGURE IT OUT.'"
