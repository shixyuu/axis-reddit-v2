        "In response to 'I really wish we would call it executive dysfunction disorder or something because the current name is very misleading. The inability to focus is problematic, but it’s far from the most debilitating aspect of ADHD.

I wasn’t a believer until I had a kid with severe adhd. It really is like a type of brain damage. “White lady with an iPhone” syndrome  is totally different, but it makes just about everyone everyone I know say “oh yeah! I have adhd too!” 🙄\nI’m like “please: my kid is flunking kindergarten and first grade because he doesn’t do anything except in small Group, can’t remember anything and has emotional meltdowns at the smallest thing.”'"
