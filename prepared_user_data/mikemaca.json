        "In response to 'Original Post: OMFG. What?!? So regular working is \"quiet quitting\" now? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0xvxv41m8axc1.png', a user said: 'Olive Keogh’s article in the Irish Times defines diligently and responsibly working one’s contract hours as a bad thing and a form of quitting and cheating one's employer. This offensive contortion of fact is one that anyone would struggle to grasp and has no place in any periodical with a shred of journalistic decency or integrity.\nIt is asserted that employees are obliged to put in extra hours, do additional work and recalibrate their work-life balance for the “benefits” of social capital, “wellbeing” and career success.\nWhat if instead employees are paid for the time they are expected to work?\nResource staff sufficiently to complete work within business hours, respect the rights of staff to a fulfilling life not defined by their day jobs, and stop using gaslighting terms like “quiet quitting” for fulfilling the terms of their contract of employment.\nThis may seem radical to those managers who have been around the block, but key performance indicators don’t spend time with loved ones nor do they put food on the table.'"
