I’m not rushing to get more done to make up for that break time. And if I leave on time, my laptop stays closed until the next workday. I don’t mind stretching my hours at home and if I’m interested in what I’m doing? I’ll probably forget to take a break. But not at the office.', a user said: 'I was told we were RTO to interact and be more creative. I have refused to have any discussions or interactions that aren't work related. I also did everything I could to make Ron Swanson look social. I was back home within a week.'",

        "In response to 'I know but like are you immune to it? I'd be overwhelmed with how awkward that would be.', a user said: 'You just have to decide to embrace it. I don't want to be around the people in the office, so it's not hard to be unpleasant.'"
