        "In response to 'I think it became normalised on this sub because it's such an easily attacked term that people here enjoy when it comes up - never heard a person in real life use it in anything but a sarcastic manner', a user said: 'It's a term that we all have as workers been hearing all our lives, just some marketing asshat finally decided to name the beast.\nI got denied a raise after I told a supervisor I wasn't going to train someone for them on a day they didn't want to deal with their blue tooth headset.\nTheir supervisor told me I had turned down team building opportunities and that's why there was no raise without proving I could work better with the group.\nHonestly it's great someone decided to name it just to get more clicks, your boss isn't your friend asking a favor to drop off these bills after work or swing by a sister store on the way in, they are asking for free labor.\n(And the threat of withholding compensation at any point they don't get enough free out of you.)'"
