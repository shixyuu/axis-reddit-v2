        "In response to 'In the uk we never had quite quitting and we already had ‘working to rule’ whereas no extras, not one second or not one extra duty was performed. This has crippled companies, especially those who rely on staff to preform regular overtime (including paid). Let’s face it, it’s not quitting if you do exactly what is written in your contract.', a user said: 'Always found the expression disingenuous.\nHow is doing the agreed upon amount of work for the agreed upon amount of money \"quitting\".\nThe first time I heard about \"quiet quitting\" I thought it was people who kept coming to their job but did nothing until they where fired. But the reality is much more toxic.'"
