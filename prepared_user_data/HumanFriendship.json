        "In response to 'That's why they've gamified the workplace. They create a \"competition\" that you didn't want to be in, give you fake fucking points for bullshit \"prizes\" no one wants, and trick dumber employees into self policing out of their fear of not \"winning\". And then, even when you do over perform, you have to contend with nepotism/cronyism for a position you're more qualified for and deserving of. Jedi mind trick to the max. So grateful to have escaped before I was too old to enjoy my life.', a user said: 'The worst I've seen is using productivity as a way to justify favoritism.
