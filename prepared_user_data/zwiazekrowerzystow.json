        "In response to 'About 20ish years ago corporate America connected to the positive thinking movement to push a reality where people were talked into being happy regardless of the reality. They used this to bully people into having \"passion\" for things they didn't, which became a passive aggressive way to guilt trip people into thinking something was wrong with them when they weren't \"on fire\" for their job.', a user said: 'I’ve been seeing this shit for most of my working life. One executive at a company was giving a presentation and made a comment along the lines of, “you should have passion for everything you do.”\nHe then looked directly at me thinking he was advising me because he knew I didn’t give a shit. Since then, that guy has gained 50lbs and looks ashen.\nThat’s what passion for your work brought you? I’ll pass.'"
