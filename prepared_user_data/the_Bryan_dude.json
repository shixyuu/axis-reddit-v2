All to have the justice system look the other way and not charge or cases get dismissed. Police are only part of a justice system in SF that is broken. Lawlessness is the result and it’s easy to blame cops because they are on the front line. However, the whole system is flawed and I do believe it is specific to SF and California. Misguided public policy has failed us all.', a user said: 'Arresting and ticketing them creates a dangerous situation and cops don’t think it’s worth it to risk their own safety, do the work to build a case.\nIt's literally their JOB!
