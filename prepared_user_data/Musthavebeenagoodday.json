        "In response to 'Original Post: SPE quiet quitting I never thought quiet quitting could be so detrimental to an organization.\nMy spe went from being a superstar spe in the workgroup to nobody home. He was involved in a ton of projects and was well respected by probationary examiners.\nHis out of office teams status message used to be a mile long with many alternative POCs for his projects ... now its like \"off till monday, no phone/email access, contact any workgroup spe\".\nJunior examiner actions get zero feedback and are quickly signed.\nYet morale is high and smiles all around, right?', a user said: 'Why become a SPE; examiners are the top of the org chart. /s'",
        "In response to 'Maybe he has some personal matters to take care of. Or he has to burn some use or lose leave hours.', a user said: 'My spe fits this reason. But i also think my spe (an excellent spe imo) has abbreviated his work effort.'"
