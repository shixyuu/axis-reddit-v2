        "In response to 'they are firing people and overworking existing people, expecting them to do additional work. Ie, reduce a team of 10 to 6 and expect the same total team work for the same individual pay.\nGawd I WISH I had 6 people left when they did this to me. It was a team of 8-10 and then it became a team of manager and me... then just me. Then day shift got MORE people and still somehow did LESS work so I was stuck doing overtime all the time every day. No pay increase though. However they DID take the time to tell me no more breaks allowed because of all of the shit to do.', a user said: 'Sounds like lawyer time. Bc just bc they demand shit doesnâ€™t mean they get a pass for illegal shit.'"
