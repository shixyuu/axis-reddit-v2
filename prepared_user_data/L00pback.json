        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Vivek Ramaswamy 'quiet quitting' his campaign? It sure seems so. [External Link]: https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ramaswamy-2024-presidential-election-campaign-rcna131919', a user said: 'Trump’s team met with many the GOP groups that make the rules for the primaries to effectively shut everyone else out. Colorado shut out PACs to cripple DeSantis and California made it a winner-take-all for delegates for anyone with over 50% of vote in the primaries.\nThis isn’t the same team as 2016, these are veterans of election fuckery. The primary for the GOP is basically wrapped. They are trying to ensure rules like “if a candidate under possible indictment can’t be a candidate” don’t happen as well.'"
