        "In response to 'anyone know what the song is?', a user said: 'https://youtu.be/YEKYG-zvQvA?si=F6pFpJnkXbMGprt2\nThe song is called Bubamara and it was written by Nele Karajlić for the Serbian movie\nBlack Cat, White Cat\n. The movie is about gypsy community so the song is popular among gypsies worldwide. It's also popular among marching bands, so it's not that strange to hear it all the way in the US.'",
        "In response to 'It's written by Nele Karajlić of The No Smoking Orchestra, which band collaborated with Kusturica on soundtracks and albums.\nA few bootlegs of the soundtrack wrongly list Goran Bregović as composer.', a user said: 'Yeah, you're right. I actually first wrote Nele, but then googled it and it said Bregović was a writer, so I edited it (I'm gonna edit it back to Nele, my bad). It makes so much more sense that Nele wrote it since the movie has other songs performed by his band Zabranjeno Pušenje (No Smoking/Forbidden Smoking).\nIt's not that strange that people wrongly think that Bregović wrote this because he wrote songs for a few Kusturica movies.'"
