        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'I think quiet quitting applies to white collar workers with minimal supervision who get to fuck off at work all the time, so no one notices.\nI slack off for a week, I'm gone, and the landlord puts me outside. The job description doesn't matter. It says right in there \"... and whatever other duties your supervisor assigns to you,\" meaning, whatever the fuck they want.\nThey wanna pull me off my desk and have me go pick in the warehouse? That's what happens.'",
        "In response to 'I was waiting for this response.\nI'm 40. Every job I've ever had was one with \"other duties as assigned\" in the job description. That's what happens when you don't have a degree to leverage.', a user said: 'That's the difference between the bottom 80th percentile of earners and the top 20th, as far as I'm concerned.\nNot that plenty of them don't get worked to death, but, it just isn't the same.'"
