        "In response to 'Adding to this, being a great employee doesn’t make you a great manager they are two different skill sets and not entirely transferable. You said you’ve been doing this job for a few months, I’m assuming the external hire has more than a few months experience. It stings, but doesn’t automatically mean you were wronged. Get feedback, see what you can learn from the external hire while turning off all the extra work you’ve been doing for free. Use that feedback and skills you pick up from the external to get you a role elsewhere. Good lunck.', a user said: 'Adding to this, evaluate the new manager. You may find that while they don't have the specific institutional knowledge that you have from being with the company and department like you have, they may be an incredible manager with tons of experience. At least give it a chance to see if their hiring was justified and you could learn from them.\nIf you legitimately find that's not the case, then I would recommend looking elsewhere.'"
