Recently I was on vacation and my boss texted me on my personal phone and asked if I did something which was someone else’s responsibility. I said no. I got we will talk about this when you get back. Union notified. Union told me I do not have to answer boss while on vacation and if needed he will sit there during meetings with me. I’m going to see what the meeting is about first and if there is anything to sign, I’m gonna stop meeting immediately and discuss rescheduling when union rep gets there. My boss constantly contradicts their self and then blames us when stuff goes to shit.'"
