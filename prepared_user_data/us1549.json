        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'It goes both ways. If I have an employee that does the absolute bare minimum, I am fine with that but will not extend any courtesies to that person and hold them to the letter of the law.\nYou need an afternoon off for the doctor's? Sorry, take PTO for that.\nOh you're hungover and don't want to come in? sorry I can't let you WFH, take a PTO day.\nMy point of saying this is not to be an asshole but if I see you sometimes go above and beyond for your job, I will absolutely go above and beyond as your manager.\nYou should not expect your managers to bend backwards for you if you only put in the bare minimum.\nI am also okay with people using all their sick time since it's a benefit you are given and should be able to use without judgement'"
