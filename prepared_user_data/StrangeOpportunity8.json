        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting - How do I do it properly Been at J2 for 9 months. Reorg in March completely dismantled my team. Manager new what was happening and fled to a new team.\nWas assigned to a new team a couple of months ago. Have not had any work assigned in almost a month. I log on. Attend a couple of team meetings. And that is it. Asked my current (new) manager if there were opportunities to hop on other projects. They pretty much responded by telling me to enjoy the free time and that they would get back to me. A new manager for my team will be hired within the next month.\nI've applied for an internally posted role with no success. No response to application.\nAny thoughts on how to handle this situation. I literally am doing nothing and earning a paycheck. Am I wrong to continue logging in until I get let go?\nThought about taking PTO for a week. Thinking now that I should just save my PTO, log in, start my mouse jiggler, and go about my business.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is actually doing your job and no more than your job.\nIf you want to quit/be fired, just start doing your job sloppily or not at all and see how long it takes for them to fire you.'",
        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is actually doing your job and no more than your job\nSo literally preforming to expectations and getting all your work done well and on time is considered “quiet quitting”?', a user said: 'Yes. That’s what all the articles state buried in them.    “ Cindy wouldn’t put in extra time and effort to to help team members with their work and when asked to take on more outside get job description and without extra pay, refused”'"
