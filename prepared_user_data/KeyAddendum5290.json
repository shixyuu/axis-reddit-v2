        "In response to 'My job is brutal. However going above and beyond has meant I’ve gotten a 30% increase in my salary over two years. I have worked for every last penny of that but I would guess this is why other people as well do more than what is expected. I think this only works for some jobs however. If I was in a job where I knew progression was never going to happen then I wouldn’t put in as much effort.', a user said: 'For me, going above and beyond from the start has always meant not just good payrises, but that very quickly any employer starts being fine with flexibility. Because I always looked after my employer, they always looked after me. That's why I can come in late, or go early, or take longer for lunch, or book a health appointment halfway through the morning, without ever needing to come up against any petty rules.\nEmployers who are doing the bare minimum for their staff are going to get the bare minimum back. But it's amazing how quickly things change when one side starts going above and beyond. My team, when I started, were definitely doing the bare minimum - pack up on the dot of five, never do anything they didn't have to. But when I took over, and started saying 'it's 4pm on Friday, no point starting something new, just go and enjoy your weekend', the change was remarkable. After a few years, they know they will always get flexibility from me, and as a result, they can go above and beyond without feeling like that will mean they are being exploited. I think the world of my team now, and they all earn way more than when I started - before I started, half of them were considered poor performers, and hadn't had a decent pay rise for 5 years.'"
