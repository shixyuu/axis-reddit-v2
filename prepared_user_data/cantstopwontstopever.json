Regardless of what they say, employers don’t hold all the cards. Push back against overwork. Demand to be paid for the product of your labour. Refuse to allow work into your personal life. Set your boundaries and stick the fuck to them. Next, we need to tackle the evil location-based pay. That simply needs to end now.'"
