        "In response to 'As someone who is 5 years into the industry, they are a bunch of psychos. I used to keep getting attacked because - \"You only do what you are given. You don't have initiative, you should go above and beyond and voluntarily take up more projects.\"\nBasically, here is the deal - they cannot reduce the salaries. Hence, they are firing people and overworking existing people, expecting them to do additional work. Ie, reduce a team of 10 to 6 and expect the same total team work for the same individual pay. Hence, they are asking us to \"go above and beyond\" and do other people's jobs.\nOh also, meanwhile, they can fire you at anytime with zero justification, and have the security clear out your desk within 10 minutes.', a user said: 'At my last job they fired (or drove to quit) three people, then gave me all their tasks without a pay increase. Finally, after much wheel squeaking on my part they hired me an assistant, who was 19 with no prior work experience but his family went to church with the boss. Shit at the job, could not teach him anything, but he worked for half my pay.\nSo after i trained him they fired me and gave him my job with no raise.'"
