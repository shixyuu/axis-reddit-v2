The tumor had grown so large the had to close him up when they went to take it out. It had grown on his liver and kidneys. His treatment was successful. He’s here with me 20 years later at the age of 84. They gave him chemo to reduce the mass, operated on him, removed part of his liver and most of his colon and then more radiotherapy I think? But he’s fine. It was successful.'",
