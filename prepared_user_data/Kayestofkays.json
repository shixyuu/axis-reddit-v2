        "In response to 'My boss will literally not accept any 5/5 review on any of the 20 areas i am reviewed in.\nâ€‹\nMy manager and I mark the report, then drop all the 5/5s to 4/5s just to appease the boss.\nHe literally wont accept that i 'exceeded expectations' in an area, then asks that i try to exceed expectations.\nDid I mention he is a political candidate? Thats the mentality we want from our governing body!', a user said: 'I worked at a place that was like this. Every year, you were scored out of 5 in various areas. Getting a 5/5 was completely and utterly impossible even if you were Jesus himself. Even getting a 4.5 was virtually unheard of....Every now and then, they gave out some 4's to their super star employees. So basically, if you got anything in the 3.5 or above range you were like DAMN I DID AWESOME!\nBut it was set up such that 3.5 was only a \"meets expectations\" on the 1 to 5 scale, and that's what drove your raise. Really it was all a scam to ensure that no one got more than a 2-3% raise at best, even if they were a top performer.'"
