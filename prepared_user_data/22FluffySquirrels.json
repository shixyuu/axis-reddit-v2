        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Amazon There's a movement not really just Amazon but work in general since inflation is going so high, people are just giving up trying extra or doing more hard work than what's necessary. Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'I think it's fine to come in, do your job, meet expectations, and go home. However, some people think \"quiet quitting\" means \"slacking off until I get fired\" and that's just not a good look for anyone. If you want to quit, you should simply quit, without making leadership go through endless write-ups and retrains until they can officially terminate you.'"
