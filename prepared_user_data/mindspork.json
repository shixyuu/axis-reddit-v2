        "In response to 'It's not just exploitation of hours.\nMany companies will tell you do to your job one way, thereby maintaining legal compliance. They will however only pay you for the time required if you take shortcuts and tacitly push you to do it that way.\nCompanies and management know you're taking shortcuts, they pretend to not notice you taking them, covertly they reward those who take those shortcuts. But if shit hits the fan, because health and safety regulations weren't followed, fiscal compliance wasn't done, or someone dies, they get to blame workers (subcontractors) for not following the rules.\nProfits go up the chain, risks go down the chain.\nCommon examples: large clothing brand pretending to be shocked about conditions in subcontractor's factories despite not paying enough for better conditions, lower level employees getting all the blame for irregularities at large banks, cleaners doing only the bare minimum and using the same cloth to clean everything, factory and construction workers saving time by taking unsafe shortcuts.\nThings go well? Your manager gets a bonus. Shit hits the fan? The company will dump you like a sack of bricks.', a user said: 'tl;dr - Privatize the profits, Socialize the losses.'"
