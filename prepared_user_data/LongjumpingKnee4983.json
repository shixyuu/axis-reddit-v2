        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'The fact that everyone was let go but you tells me that they like you and will want to find a way to retain you. I would sit down with whoever you are currently reporting to and have this tough conversation. Something along the lines of....\n\"I have taken on a lot of additional responsibility lately and due to the change in the scope of my position I am no longer fairly compensated or titled. With the news that I will not be moved into the manager role, what is the plan to ensure that I am fairly compensated for my new responsibilities?\"\nThen just listen and hear what they have to say. This will be hard and uncomfortable for both of you but you need to make it clear that you do not feel properly compensated. They dont want to lose you which is why you weren't let go before, they will likely have already considered how to answer the above question when selecting the external candidate. Best of luck in this.'"
