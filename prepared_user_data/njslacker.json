        "In response to 'This isn't what quiet quitting is. It's doing must enough to avoid being fired.\nThere was a guy in my job who was looking for another job and then working out his notice. Fine, he wants to move on, no big deal. But what he did was to turn up to work and then just avoid actually doing any work, or anything he did do he'd get wrong on purpose and do it so badly that everything he did had to be checked. He wasn't doing the job he was contracted to do, but because the process to fire somebody is so lengthy (this is the UK) and he was leaving anyway, nothing could be done. Working with him was hell.', a user said: 'You are exactly right, and I think the original post misses the mark, or maybe people are conflating \"Quiet Quitting\" with \"working to the rule\" and they're actually different things.\nQuiet Quitting is doing less than you are contractually supposed to do, but enough to keep your job (or at least draw out the firing process).\nWorking to the Rule is malicious compliance to slow down productivity.\nBoth are a form of protesting working conditions a d compensation, but they are not the same.'",
        "In response to 'Pretty sure your definition of quiet quitting is not the norm. Quiet quitting is doing your responsibilities and not going above and beyond.\nQuiet quitting is NOT intentionally making mistakes. \nQuiet quitting is NOT neglecting job responsibilities.', a user said: 'Maybe my understanding is different from most people's understanding. It doesn't make sense to me that it's a type of quitting if you are doing your job.'"
