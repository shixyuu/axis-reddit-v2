        "In response to 'When did pagers become a thing?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager\nPayphones were a thing as well.\nI type the above as I have memories of the look on Dad's face when he came home with his newly-assigned pager in the 1970s. Couple that with the sour face he made at the local pool when his pager went off and he had to use the payphone to call in and see what was the emergency. While trying to hear over the screaming kids enjoying a nice summer day at the pool.\nSo this work-creep into our off time has been going on for much longer than the 1990s' innovations.\nI'm not saying this isn't a fight worth fighting by any means, just saying we've been slowly losing this battle for a very long time. ;)', a user said: 'I had this argument with a former boss that was addicted to texting all day and night even when I was off.  One day he asked me if I got his text over the weekend and I said 'I don't know let me look'.  Sure enough I had a text from him on my day off.  He asked why I didn't reply and I said 'when the company starts paying for my phone and my time to do work off hours I'll start answering texts when I'm not punched in.  That said for every text I respond to or even read I will be adding 15 minutes per event to my time card'.  He quit texting me off hours after that.  That is MY damn phone and I'll use it when I want to.  To me that's no different than a manager walking up to me and saying 'give me your keys I need to make a run down the street'..  'ummmm what?'  Ya go play hideandgofuckyourself.\nThat said me and my current boss text off hours.  Usually about guitars, music, computer stuff, but RARELY work related stuff.  We work enough hours during the week but I genuinely like the guy.'",
