Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'If you got that dog in you , you can't turn it off male or female. A lot of peoples pride comes from hard work or they have a athlete mentality. Theres hard work then there's overdoing it though. If you walk 15 miles for 3 days you need 3 days for your legs to recover. Workers are much more productive this way.'",
