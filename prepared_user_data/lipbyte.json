Well he doesn't get the bang anymore but 3/4 aint bad.\nYou realize your life is centered around him and his comfort right?\nYou realize keeping up appearances teaches your kids that his behavior is acceptable and normal for romantic partners right?\nWhy wouldn't your sons treat their partners differently, after all mom was happy to be supermom and do it all!\nWhy would your daughters expect their partners to treat them better than their dad treats you, you're happy as super mom they should be too!\nYou realize that youre passing on the generational curses your living through right?', a user said: 'Amen.\nOP, you told him the consequence of him not shaping up was you leaving. He never followed through, yet you're still there playing happy family to the detriment of you and your children.\nYou being a doormat helps no one. It is weakness, not strength, that has kept you in this marriage. And everyone except for him gets to suffer for your decision.'"
