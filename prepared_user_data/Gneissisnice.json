        "In response to 'Has anyone here ever worked somewhere, had a supervisor quit, then had to do the supervisor's job, but while being told they can't actually make you officially the supervisor yet, just so they don't have to give you a pay rise? I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'I worked at a college bookstore for a few years, making minimum wage. One of our textbook leads left and the manager called me into his office, saying he'd like me to take over some of his responsibilities. I asked if it came with a new title and pay raise and he said no, so I politely declined. He was shocked and kept pushing but I told him that I wasn't doing the work of a textbook lead while making the same amount of money as someone who started working a week ago.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Nope. I told him I'd do the extra responsibilities if it came with a pay raise, but he just expected that I'd do more work for $8/hr.'"
