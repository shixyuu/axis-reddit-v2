        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'In my experience going above and beyond for your workplace usually doesn't get you promoted because you've made yourself too affordable and valuable in the role you are in. I do all of my work and I go home. I get paid hourly and have designated tasks and get them all done timely and accurately. I don't get paid to answer questions or calls on my off time and I don't get paid to go above and beyond my coworkers being paid the same.\nI think the people usually spouting off about it are employers who quit showing up for their employees long ago and have expectations they can't hold themselves to.'"
