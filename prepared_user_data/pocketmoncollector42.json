        "In response to 'Original Post: And they wonder why we quiet quit.... Worked at a this place for about a year, did a major systems overhaul with them where I was the front runner for work completed for the project, which helped us finish on our deadline, got praised and honored for my work, then I was told I'd get a nice raise, my raise was less than a fucking dollar in software development... I got a 2% raise when inflation is absolutely ravaging the country and prices have gone up much more than 2%.. works a fucking joke...', a user said: 'Once had an employer ask if I was quitting for money. Like first of all why are you shaming me for “only money”? Like that’s literally the agreement.\nNow I wish I didn’t hold my tongue cause my first thought was “no? If it was for money, I never would’ve accepted this position that I know pays way below even the average market” I just needed a job and that’s what I had available as an unpaid intern from college.'"
