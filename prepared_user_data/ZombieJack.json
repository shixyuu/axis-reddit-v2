        "In response to '\"Taking 10\" and \"taking 20\" are rules used in an old edition.\nTaking 10 is effectively what passive perception is, but for any and all skills. It is intended to be used when the character is attempting a task that a) there's no intense time restraints/initiative and b) have no direct downsides to failure. It fixes the player just rolling again and again until they succeed on a roll they can conceivably just repeat.\nTaking 20 is the version for when they character conceivably has plenty of time to roll again and again until a 20 is rolled with absolutely no downsides to failure to failing or trying again. So they just take the time and are assumed to have gotten a maximum result.', a user said: 'I mean this is just kinda poor GMing or implementation of rules.\nIf you are looking for traps and have no time constraint, you don't just keep rolling until you get a good result. You roll once and that roll reflects the whole time you spent searching.\nIf the character wants to spend more than a normal amount of time to conduct an extra thorough search, the GM could lower the DC to reflect the increased chance of finding something.\nNever, ever just let them repeat rolls.'"
