        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It’s an Americanism for something most people do because there’s little reason to do more for your employer - do your job and nothing more.\n‘Quiet Quitting’ is just another way of making it sound like you aren’t doing enough because your working to live, not living to work. Detestable phrase.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'Quiet Quitting is just some term cooked up in an HR Department to further browbeat their - probably American - staff into accepting the idea they have to sacrifice their lives to make someone else rich.\nIt’s called ‘doing your job and nothing more’ because the company won’t compensate you for doing more. It’s a mugs game.\nOf course, if you’re lucky enough to work for a company that will reward you then go for it! However in the 14 companies I’ve worked for during the course of my 30 year or so career so far, I think I’ve only worked for 2 that did. And that was mostly just ‘we’ll pay overtime’.'"
