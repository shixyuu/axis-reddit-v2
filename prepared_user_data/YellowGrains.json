        "In response to 'Not sure what she is dealing with as she refuses to talk. She never really has been a caregiver. I don’t own things and manage my own care. Wish I could understand where her head is, but she won’t have communication.', a user said: 'Some people are only fairweather companions. They cannot stand having to care for or being around another person who requires care. This is apparently more common where men walk out of marriages when their spouses get sick, but it happens where women abandon their husbands too. I am terribly sorry that you are going through this, but you are not alone in that there are community groups dedicated to support not only those with cancer but situations like yours. You may want to speak with the hospital or clinic about your personal situation and see if they can provide names of support groups, rent banks, etc. There are a lot of ppl who volunteer to help as well. Do not feel you are a burden. If anything see it as people stepping up for you. Should you overcome this, you can pay it forward in kind. You deserve love and support during such difficult times. Don't feel bad for asking.'"
