        "In response to 'I’d have still kept exceeding if I was OP- reducing to hitting only the goals is technically ok but will not get OP an advancement when Boss retires.\nMy opinion: Big boss knows there are issues and is watching to see if OP excels or phones it in because they hate the boss. Assuming big boss will accept on target (but not exceeding) goals is a risk I would not take if I was OP.\nI think OP is realizing that, which is why they want to craft a review that sounds better than “I did what was asked, not a bit more”.', a user said: 'I think you’re assuming that the boss’ boss has waaaay too much time on their hands to know all of this is going on. They “know” what their direct reports tell them. Kinda.'"
