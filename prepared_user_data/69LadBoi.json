        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is declining—45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'In my opinion, quiet quitting was created by corporations to try and shame the workers that realize they are worthy and stopped killing themselves for the job. In an attempt to make them look bad. I remember a manager asking me why I stopped working as hard. I looked at them and told them “I no longer want to go home so exhausted I cannot do anything else. I am still getting my job done appropriately and I am the only one following the procedures. Thank you for checking in on me”.\nThis is America though. We should instead look at why this is happening across the world. It is not the employees fault on “quiet quitting”. It is the corporations and they need some serious reviewal. No longer is humanity a part of the world of business.'"
