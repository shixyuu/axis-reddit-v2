        "In response to 'Driving around Kyle I saw\nseven\ncops in about a\none hour\nspan of time.\nSo make sure you keep that to Austin. As soon as you leave Austin and are in say Buda, Round Rock, any part of Williamson or Hays or Travis (outside Austin) County, you will be LIT up.', a user said: 'I hope I’m not ruining my luck but I drive to New Braunfels for work a couple of times a month and to this date, I’ve never been pulled over with my 3-year expired registration.\nPD’s, to my understanding, only issue a warning for the driver to get caught up in 30 days. If the driver fails to do so, then they have to pay the fine. The 30-day warning usually scares people into handling it.\nBut, yeah, Kyle is where I see the most cops on that stretch.'",
        "In response to 'They get you back in the end when you have to go in person to renew it.', a user said: 'Stopped by to say this. Part of my tax refund went to this cause (4 years expired). And now the adventure begins again!'",
        "In response to 'When I moved to Austin 18 years ago, you could register you car for two years at a time. I think that changed when they stopped doing a separate inspection sticker. So there were odd years when my car would have current registration. It's only current now because my apartment complex put a tow sticker on it.', a user said: 'I’ve lived here for almost 30 years - I’ve never had a 2-year registration. However, there is such a thing as a 2-year registration but for brand new cars.'"
