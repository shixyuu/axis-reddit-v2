Nothing more annoying than a shopping dash for an absentee customer.', a user said: 'This. I get customers all the time acting confused when I show up with their order. Like did you not remember making the order? You forgot you ordered food/groceries and paid someone to deliver it to you?!\nBe available and aware of your phone... and for god's sake, just give gate/door codes over the app and stop being weird about it ('call from the box and I'll just buzz you in' then never answer when you're sitting outside the gate or at the front door like an idiot) ðŸ™„'"
