No, it's just work-to-rule â€” and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'If you go to the Bank of Canada website they have an inflation calculator. You can calculate that in 2022 a dollar amount of 100,000 would be equivalent to that of 28,000 in 1980.\nNow consider that productivity has skyrocketed with technological advancements and so has cost of living and it isn't hard to understand why people are pissed.\nThe wealthy broke the symbiotic relationship with the working class when they off shored manufacturing and our government didn't tariff the ever living shit out of their products.'"
