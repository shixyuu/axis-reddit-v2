        "In response to 'In kitchens it's perennial. As business declines for the season, workers don't get fired; they're just not getting hours this week.', a user said: 'I was the relief worker for a few different positions in a Hospital kitchen a long time ago. One day I might be working the front of house in the cafeteria, another day doing dishes, another day delivering food to patient rooms, etc. I was always scheduled for 40 hours every week. Didn't matter what job I was doing that day, just that I was getting paid.\nMy boss leaves on maternity leave, and a temporary manager comes in. Redoes the schedule for some reason. I look at it, like I did every time it was posted, and noticed that for one entire week I was not scheduled. WTF?\nNo notice, no talking to me beforehand, no warning whatsoever.\nI called up and quit a few days later. That's quiet firing.'"
