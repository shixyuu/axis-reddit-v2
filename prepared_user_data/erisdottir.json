        "In response to 'Honestly in Germany most people work like this. You work 8h, not including your break time, and than you go home. Sometimes you stay longer because of special projects but for this additional time you will leave earlier when it fits some other day.\nI can only say this for the jobs I had, mainly office. To be honest I would leave a job immediately if extra hours were expected from me.', a user said: 'I really, really appreciate this culture in Germany. And somehow we still manage to be productive. Weird, isn't it? Almost like burning the candle at both ends is a waste of people's lives and reasonable work expectations work out for everyone.\n(it's not true for everyone in Germany, unfortunately, exploitative working conditions are a thing here, too. On average, though, I feel it's better than many other places)'"
