        "In response to 'No pay?\nFriday night?\nResponsible for student behavior?\nLol no.', a user said: 'Frankly, I don’t do ANYTHING school-related after work, except for planning, sometimes grading, and the occasional call home to parents.\nRunning club? Nope. Drama club? Nope. Chaperone a school dance, for FREE? That’s a huge NOPE.\nI get up at 5:30 AM to go teach the little darlings, and by the end of the day, the last thing I want to do is spend more time doing extracurricular stuff with the little darlings. The extra couple of bucks (and it’s not that much extra) just isn’t worth it. Teaching is my job, my paycheck—but it isn’t my LIFE. I really wonder about people who choose to make it their whole life. I don’t get it, TBH.'"
