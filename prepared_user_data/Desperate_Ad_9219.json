        "In response to 'Original Post: What happened with quiet quitting? I'm definitively going to start quiet quitting this next month. I'm not proud to work at my current company (quite the opposite) and my boss thinks he's paying to make me his slave.\nBut I was looking for tips on how to start quiet quitting here on Reddit and I could only find old posts. It seems like it's not a thing anymore. Is quiet quitting dead? What have I missed?', a user said: 'I'm doing that now. I'm part-time and they told me if you go to this area you get the same pay but more work I was like no I'll help other departments and get five days Thank you very much.'"
