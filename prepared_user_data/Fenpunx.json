        "In response to 'There is a nuanced balance between ambition and workplace exploitation that gets lost when it's all bundled together under a single phrase of \"quiet quitting\". And much like a lot of things on the internet, the nuance and complexities are lost by people taking a strong extreme stance on it all backed up by confirmation bias examples.\nThe conversation in most UK office environments is pretty sensible now when it comes to additional responsibilities, it's asking the employees what their ambitions are rather than expecting them to do more work or more hours under the threat of being fired or held back. And then you work with them to  provide additional challenge, you give them the old \"exciting development opportunity\" pieces of work, you give them opportunities to grow and demonstrate they can work at another level.', a user said: 'Hang on, does it not have anything to do with quitting your job?'",
        "In response to 'Thanks. When I heard quiet quitting I thought it was just not turning up for work any more.', a user said: 'Me too. Just leaving your job without telling anyone? I'm still not sure how doing your job has been renamed as quitting? What are you quitting?\nI'm so confused.'"
