Said.\nI was the \"yes man\" for my last job, and even though I was underpaid, I took on anything and everything I could and did whatever I could to help anyone who needed it. Including my supervisor, who took advantage of that and piled on more and more work. Until I fell and busted my head open, resulting in a grade 2 concussion.\nI was out for four days and against the recommendation of my doctor I went back to work anyway. Fired for a \"no-call no-show\" because the accident happened after the four hour window that I had to call in. \"Justified\" by underperformance because - although I could keep up with the workload that\nmy actual job description\nentailed - I couldn't keep up with the\nadditional\nworkload he kept piling on.\nI tried. But in the end, all I got was bent over and fucked.'"
