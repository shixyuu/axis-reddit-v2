        "In response to 'We call it Work to Rule in my country and it’s a form of industrial action.\nQuiet quitting means turning up and leaving on time but not sending emails, because sending emails isn’t part of your job description', a user said: 'Thanks for posting; I didn't realize this distinction.  For anyone interested, here's some wiki info:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule\nWork-to-rule is a job action in which employees do no more than the minimum required by the rules of their contract, and precisely follow all safety or other regulations, which may cause a slowdown or decrease in productivity, because the employer did not hire enough employees or pay the appropriate salary and as such does not have the requirements needed to run at the level they desire.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_quitting\nQuiet quitting is an application of work-to-rule, in which employees work within defined work hours and engage in work-related activities solely within those hours. Despite the name, the philosophy of quiet quitting is not connected to quitting a job outright, but rather doing precisely what the job requires.[1] Proponents of quiet quitting also refer to it as acting your wage.'"
