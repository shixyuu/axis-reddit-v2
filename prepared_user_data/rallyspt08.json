        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'I saw this term for the first time last week. It felt weird to have a term like this put on how I feel. I'm not quitting my job, but damned if I'm not burnt out on having to work 40hrs plus just to barely scrape by. If I'm not gonna get paid a livable wage, they get exactly what they pay for. Enough to look busy, and get done exactly what needs to, and not a single thing more.'"
