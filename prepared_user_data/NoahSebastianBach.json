        "In response to 'Original Post: Move over, quiet quitting. 'Rage applying' is the latest form of worker revenge | CBC Radio [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/rage-applying-1.6759642', a user said: 'She rage applied other jobs because her current job hired someone she was “uncomfortable” with and they didn’t respect her boundaries? WTF does that even mean? Employers are expected to cater when you have to work with somebody you don’t like? Jesus H Christ. That’s every job ever.'",
        "In response to 'I'm really struggling to follow your logic\nhave job\nemployer hires someone you don't like\nemployer isn't expected to solve this problem\nsolve problem without employers involvement (leave)\nI genuinely have no idea where the \"problem\" lies.', a user said: 'The problem is she expected her employer to accommodate her discomfort with someone they hired.'",
        "In response to 'no she didn't. she left her job', a user said: 'Because her discomfort wasn’t accommodated. She says they didn’t respect her boundaries, so obviously she brought it up, and they rightly said tough shit. Didn’t read the article eh?'",
        "In response to 'The problem is that she acted like a millennial stereotype and whined about her \"boundaries\" being violated and she expected her employer to accommodate her.\nWe all work with people we dislike and  having to deal with them is part of \"adulting\"\nI'm happy she's doing better but this isn't a story', a user said: 'Yup. Commenters here defending her are conveniently glossing over that part about her “boundaries”. Clearly she brought it up with her employer, and they rightly told her too bad. She had every right to find a new job if she wasn’t happy, but grow the fuck up.'"
