[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/2w7qh0ipwcj91.png', a user said: 'This may be a dumb question but something I have genuinely wondered. What if you moved to a different country and just refused to pay back that student loan debt? I understand that it would make it potentially difficult to reenter the country if you had to. What if you just decided you were never coming back to the US, what could/would they actually do?'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Oh yeah, it's not something I will ever do but I was just curious. I would 100 percent move out of this country if given the proper opportunity but not just to escape student loan debt. I just have always wondered the repercussions of saying \"fuck it\" and just rolling out. If you're living in another country, the government can destroy your credit all they want, and it wouldn't have any impact on your life there, I assume.'"
