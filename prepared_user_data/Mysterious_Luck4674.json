        "In response to '“Quiet quitting” but you want to stay 5 more years in the hopes your stay outlives your bosses’ stay?\nI would think hard about that strategy and how it benefits you.\nThat said, it’s hard to frame it as a goals discussion if you have no intention of progressing. If you truly want to just outrun the clock and do very little for the next few years, maybe just talk about how you’re happy in your role and feel this is the right pace for you. Focus on how you’ve met your metrics. If pressed, say it isn’t the right time in your life to take on more. Short, sweet answers.', a user said: 'Yeah, it’s not real quiet “quitting” if you plan on staying for 5 years. Saying you are comfortable in your role and current duties and don’t want to take on more is fine, but you won’t get any more raises or promotions this way. You are doing the bare minimum, expect to get that in return.'"
