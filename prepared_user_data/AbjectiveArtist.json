        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'Its because if you voice the fact that you want to quit/leave or unhappy your boss might screw you over by scheduling you less or just firing you so instead of having the time to get a new job, your just screwed.\nI did the bare minimum for my job the last two months but i still did a good job, especially compared to other employees since i was actively interviewing for other companies. As soon as i put my two week notice my boss started ripping my remaining shifts away with no communication.'"
