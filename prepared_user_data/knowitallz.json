        "In response to 'Original Post: what's up with quiet quitting? I've heard this term \"quiet quitting\" over the last year, indicating that people doing their jobs are somehow not doing enough. If the minimum requirement isn't enough, shouldn't the minimum be reset?  I feel like I'm misunderstanding the meaning of this term.\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/what-is-quiet-quitting-6743910', a user said: 'Answer: It's a misnomer. It's just doing the minimum amount of work to not get fired. Or basically what you were hired to do. Rather than the overworked, doing too much all the time kind of work that has been expected far too long.\nThere is no quitting involved.\nIt just means doing your work and going home and not taking it with you. Having some work life boundaries.'"
