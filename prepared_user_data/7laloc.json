        "In response to 'I did listen.  And I'm asking what 'tactics' you're talking about are being deployed to 'manufacture chaos'.   Can you please be specific about one?', a user said: 'The tactics being used are corporate propaganda used to demonize unionization and prevent workers from demanding higher wages.  Or the “people don’t want to work” style of messaging being used to gaslight workers’ legitimate arguments for better pay and better working conditions.  Manufactured chaos is the attempt to turn public opinion against workers who are fighting for fair treatment in a labor market where there are 2 jobs for every 1 jobseeker.  And these arguments don’t even touch the micro tactics in individual companies like being potentially fired for discussing salary, firings for trying to unionize, or shutting down locations that are discussing unionizing even when the business is still viable—just to discourage unionizing at other locations.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: What leaders need to know about quiet quitting… aka the labor rebellion [External Link]: https://v.redd.it/xravs6qh8ot91', a user said: 'I think a huge factor to this entire issue that is wholly being missed is the generational population gap.  The boomer generation has been selling their homes and stocks en masse during the high prices and retiring.  Add in early retirements from covid concerns and some  unfortunate covid deaths and you have a large vacuum of open positions in industry.  Now, high worker demand, smaller generational population of the workers left, companies competing for skilled employees, and historically terrible wage growth over the last few decades has given the smaller workforce a great bargaining position to demand decent wages—or at least wages equivalent to where wages should have been with normal growth since the 80s.'"
