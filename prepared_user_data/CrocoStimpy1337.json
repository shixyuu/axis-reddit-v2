        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'Quiet resistance is more like it. My supervisor (education field) told me at my most recent 3-times-a-year performance evaluation that \"It's like you do the absolute minimum to meet the requirements and nothing more.\"\nI'm thinking \"Yes, after more than 10 years of not getting a salary that reflects my experience and education, then was forced to teach in classrooms practically designed to spread COVID during a global pandemic, in a place where the locals are armed to the teeth and excited as f to bring on civil war/the Apocalypse (including administrators and colleagues)... the fact that I haven't set your desk on fire or sh*t in your coffeemaker means I've been successful in investing any extra effort I can muster in my own sanity, not in your meaningless metrics.\"'"
