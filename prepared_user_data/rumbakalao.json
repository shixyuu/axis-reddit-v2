        "In response to 'The term \"quiet quitting\" has been invented by an abusive manager with the intent to shame employees who weren't kneeling down and kissing their boots for a few coins.\nI suggest we come up with a more fitting term, like working \"by the letter\"', a user said: 'It's so egregious that honestly I would fully claim it, unabashedly. Yeah I'm quiet quitting, if that's what you want to call it, and what are they going to do about it? I'm doing my job and nothing about it is write up or fire worthy, so this seems like a made up term/trend that will flame out real quick.'"
