I think it's sad that there is a number of people who think giving what is agreed upon is \"silent quitting\", when in reality it is just simply the tradeoff between employer and employee.', a user said: 'Welcome to Public education everyone! No raises, no bonuses and please come to work every weekend as well as a couple weeks during your summer vacation!'",
        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is a bs moniker made up by the capitalistic bootlickers. Doing your job within the scope of your job duties and not going beyond that is in no way an act of quitting. The capitalists are just so used to being in a power imbalance with the workforce that they now expect everyone to devote all of their life energy to the betterment of their shareholders profits. Sounds like the capitalists have a major case of entitlement disease. Whomever still uses this terminology is perpetuating a myth.', a user said: 'Agreed.
