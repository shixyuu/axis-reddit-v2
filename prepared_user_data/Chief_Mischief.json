Dunno if it's the same in Japan, but in Korea it's generally seen as unprofessional/disrespectful to leave the office before your boss. Consider the layers of management in a conglomerate like Samsung, and you start understanding why the birth rates are the lowest in the world. Additionally, long hours ≠ productivity, oftentimes is counterproductive if you have people just doing random shit to look busy to fill their hours because they finished their work 3 hours ago. And that's not even all - Korea also has an intense drinking culture, where work colleagues generally drink after a long day in the office.\nIt's very little surprise to me that the younger generations are snapping and revolting against this structure.'"
