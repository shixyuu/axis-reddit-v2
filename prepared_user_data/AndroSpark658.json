Someone calls after hours, direct them to the other person as youre past your limit.\nWork isnt getting done,.. tell the manager to hire someone else. Cant afford it in the budget, well thats the managers job to figure out.', a user said: 'I tell my Dev team that the work will be there tomorrow and to log off and stop working after their day is done. its one thing to put in a couple extra minutes to finish a thought, its another thing entirely to put in many more hours cleaning up someone elses mess.\nI do caveat this with outages as well as just very big impactful work we might need it for. I push hard for them to draw boundaries with their hours, but also to note that there are times when its warranted.'"
