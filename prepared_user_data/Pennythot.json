Why would they fire OP when they‚Äôre short staffed and begging current employees to take more shifts. If you don‚Äôt want to work more then don‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt. I do my 40 and leave too.'",
        "In response to 'There are some managers out there that are actually just that stupid. They will cut off their own nose to spite their face.', a user said: 'Very true! Don‚Äôt doubt that at all. I think with the union on OP‚Äôs side they‚Äôd have to find an actual reason though and not working more than 40 hours isn‚Äôt a good one. OP you should report this meeting go your union rep ASAP so they gave it documented too. If they do fire you you could negotiate severance pay and all that. Make it hard for the fuckers to fire you! Fuck these corporations and fuck stupid managers. The power belongs to the people. If they want to take you down, raise hell about, but play their game while you do it. DOCUMENT, REPORT, LOG EVERYTHING. Play hard ball and make them regret picking a fight with you.  Most people after they‚Äôre unjustly fired retreat with their tail tucked between their legs and that‚Äôs not right! We need to stand up NOW. ‚úäüèΩ'",
        "In response to 'Why would they fire OP\nBecause he's shown to be a problem and \"not a team player\". It's how management thinks, if you want to call it that.', a user said: 'And document everything from now on! That meeting included. Keep a daily log of every single task you complete'"
