        "In response to 'Original Post: The Flipside of \"quiet quitting\" is quiet paying. Don't forget this. Somebody older I know asked me why young people are \"quiet quitting\" their jobs and not trying to work hard. I told them that quiet quitting is a bullshit term that describes doing what was outlined in your contract, and not more. He started to tell me how you need to hustle and do more than the minimum if you want to succeed. I told him that the difference compared to many years ago is that now hard work is not met with commensurate rewards or opportunities. Then I asked him the following question:\nIf it is culturally acceptable to push people to go above and beyond what is outlined in their contract, why does the company always only pays what was agreed upon? Why doesn't payroll ever go above and beyond what was agreed? Shouldn't it also be culturally acceptable to expect extra salary in this case? Aren't my company quiet paying me?\nHe had nothing to say and just looked uncomfortable. He didn't really agree but he has no good answer either.', a user said: 'Recently, I had a check in with my team lead related to my performance and he outlined that I log off early for the day as he sees me offline at 7 or 8 pm, and I told him that my work shift is from 9 am till 6 pm and guess what his response was. He told me to stretch out my work day to be available for anyone wanting to contact me till at least 10 pm, while only filling out 9 hours in the daily timesheet. All this bullshit about going above and beyond should stop, and since I am selling hours of my lifetime to the company for a shit pay, I will not give any more hours than agreed upon for the shit pay just because a daydreaming lunatic asshole is asking me to do so.'"
