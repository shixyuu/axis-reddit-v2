        "In response to 'When I was 14, 15 & 16, I worked at a hot dog stand.  My boss paid us (all teens) cash out of the register.  If he came by and someone had done something above-and-beyond, he'd go buy them ice cream, or hand them an extra $20.  After particularly busy weekends he'd take us out to eat AND hand us extra cash.  He bought cases of drinks and a mini fridge for employee use only.  He closed for a holiday and took the entire crew to the beach (included breakfast at his house and meals all day, plus spending money).\nThat's the last boss I have had who was right at my elbow to fairly compensate me for extra effort.  I knew that if I took on a crappy task, I would see a decent reward.  I'd still work for him 30+ years later if I could, because he was a good boss who knew the value of every employee and was ready to pay us for doing jobs that he didn't want to do himself.', a user said: 'And that's how everyone should feel and be treated. Bosses who respect and appreciate their employees can make a small / family business profitable and grow into a huge business. Corpos who focus only on the bottom line drain the life and wealth out of everyone around them until all the workers of quality melt away to find other opportunities. Then they wonder why their costs go up and turnover is terrible and \"why doesn't anyone want to work?\" Because, Carl, you're a shitty boss.'"
