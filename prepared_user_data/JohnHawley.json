Coming from some that has done both in the same line of work basically now just managing what I used to do. I’d much rather do the shit I used to do without managing at the same pay band I’m at now.', a user said: 'I've declined every time I've been asked to move to a management position, the pay is not worth being unhappy and working as the middle man between upper and engineering.'"
