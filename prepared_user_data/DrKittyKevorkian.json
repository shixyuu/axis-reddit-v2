        "In response to 'Doesn’t believe in it?? It’s not the tooth fairy, it’s literally happening.\nPeople don't get to C-suite position because they're especially smart or uniquely talented. They get there\nbecause they lack the ability to feel empathy\n. It doesn't take talent or genius to figure out how to exploit people, all it takes is a lack ability to care about their wellbeing.', a user said: 'I work a job whose outcome directly impacts c suite bonuses. It's a job that is never finished (infection prevention) and for the number of hospital beds we have, we should have at least one more team member. I work my ass off for 8 hours daily and then I go home. My boss fully supports this, but she doesn't micromanage anyone's comings and goings. My peers come in early, stay late, and take passive aggressive shots at me if I take more than two consecutive days off. They had an \"intervention\" a while back, without my boss. I deferred the conversation until our boss was present. Couldn't resist the parting shot that I wasn't going to spend my spare time padding c suite bonuses, and I would prefer no one else did either because Suite isn't going to staff us adequately until our skeleton crew impacts their bottom line.'"
