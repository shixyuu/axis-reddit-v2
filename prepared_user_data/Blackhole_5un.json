        "In response to 'Original Post: Reddit was so hot on \"quiet quitting\" but now when you talk about using slowdowns to interfere with the fascist takeover, all you hear is crickets We are at a pivotal moment, where either we choose to plunge the system into darkness on our terms temporarily, or the oligarchs drive the system into darkness on their terms for the foreseeable future.  And yet, so many people seem willing to just continue, business as usual, even as our protections (worker protections, immigrant protections, social services) evaporate before our eyes.\nThe ruling class may own the companies, but the working class still runs them, and we have a chance to use that to help ward off the darkness.', a user said: 'Most people are all talk and no action. Anonymity is both a blessing and a boon in that you can play pretend all you want. Now that repercussions are likely coming from fallboy and his orange overlord, people are scared. Most people can't afford to lose their jobs, but what happens when it is taken away anyways? People need to stand up now, before it's too late. There will be economic hardship, but it will be shared. Think of all the opportunities once this idiot is sent packing and all the jobs still need to be done again.'"
