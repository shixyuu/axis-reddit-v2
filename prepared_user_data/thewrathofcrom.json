        "In response to 'Original Post: Bill Maher being very anti WFH and against quiet quitting the past year [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/6nykqc1bx0pa1.png', a user said: 'I'm a line cook who's never held an office job in my life. I always wonder every time I see some passive aggressive anti WFH tweet: Why are all these boomers so against it? Why does it enrage them so much that people don't want to get up early, get all dressed up, commute for an hour or more and sit at a desk  for eight plus hours? So what if people want to wear their pajamas while they work at home? The work is still getting done and more efficiently at that, at least most of the time. And wouldn't companies save more money if they took offices out of the equation? Seems like a no brainer to me.'"
