I am good at job and my team and peers like me but most of company leaders are incompetent so they don't demand a lot anyways. Measly  raise. C level is a revolving door.  36 offices have been closed world wide. They want us to be WFH but as a company we are aimless. Pandemic burnout is still there for me as i have a 3 yo kid. I have been looking to change into a much senior role that is challenging and exciting, but most companies I have interviewed with give me the same vibes. And those that don't, won't pay. I started my own micro agency and while new clients have dried up, I do have regular proposals to send but I don't feel like giving me best on it.\nIn short, I am not working as hard as I'd like mainly because of burnouts from multiple front .'"
