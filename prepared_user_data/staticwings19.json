        "In response to 'Original Post: Reddit was so hot on \"quiet quitting\" but now when you talk about using slowdowns to interfere with the fascist takeover, all you hear is crickets We are at a pivotal moment, where either we choose to plunge the system into darkness on our terms temporarily, or the oligarchs drive the system into darkness on their terms for the foreseeable future.  And yet, so many people seem willing to just continue, business as usual, even as our protections (worker protections, immigrant protections, social services) evaporate before our eyes.\nThe ruling class may own the companies, but the working class still runs them, and we have a chance to use that to help ward off the darkness.', a user said: 'Reminder that \"Quiet quitting\" was doing your job.\nIt was never a movement,  it was a discouraging term to shame workers into doing more work than they're paid for.\nQuiet quitting isn't real. Was never real, and the faster the term dies the better for everyone.'"
