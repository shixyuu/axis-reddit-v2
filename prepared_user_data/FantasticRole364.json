Far from their agreed contract.\nThey were doing pretty much nothing and hoping to just not get noticed', a user said: 'Ahh well that's something else entirely isn't it? That's not quiet quitting that's the underperforming. You really should know the difference'",

No more going above and beyond. They do that intially to hook you (promotion, recognition or whatever) but beyond that, nada. So yeah, they can get fucked and keep acting shocked and forlorn when I stop raising my hand to take shit on and leave on time'"
