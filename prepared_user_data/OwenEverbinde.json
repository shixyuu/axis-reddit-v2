        "In response to 'It's not fun advice, but this advice has kept my family almost entirely financially stable.\nThe best way to make sure you have enough money is almost always to cut back.\nCut back on what, you might ask? Virtually anything that isn't mandatory.\nIf it doesn't keep the lights on, if it doesn't keep the water running, if it isn't food or water, you should reduce or eliminate it from your budget until you reach a point where you can easily afford it again.\nI've had to be extremely, extremely tight with my money in order to make things relatively comfortable for my family. We can pay bills, we can afford food, but we are slowly building enough money to afford other eventual necessities.\nClothes? Yes and no. New clothes are limited and have to be bought cheap, if cheap is even an option. Work clothes are almost always expensive.\nAppliances? Something broke? If it isn't life-changing, go without it for a while. You will eventually have the money to buy it again.\nHouse repairs? Depends on how serious it is. In reality, you should always strive to keep at least a small amount of extra money somewhere in case of a worst case scenario for house damage. If you are renting and don't have to repair things yourself, keep a small amount as a cushion for rent.\nThis is a huge deal.\nStreaming? Recreation? Fun? You have to find ways to adapt. If you want to have a reasonable supply of money then you will definitely have to go without the cutting-edge stuff. Buy what you know you can reasonably afford when it's possible.\nYes, all of this advice applies to if you are paying back debt. I am still in this situation myself. I am paying back at least 3 sources of debt, one of which is relatively major. Trust me when I say the road ahead won't be easy, but you will be able to catch your breath a bit if you learn how to manage it properly.', a user said: 'Also make sure to have a slow cooker and cook your own chickpeas, beans and rice from scratch. A noticeable amount of money is saved that way.'"
