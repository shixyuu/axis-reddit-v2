        "In response to 'Original Post: [Discussion] Pod Save America - \"Is Biden Quiet Quitting?\" (12/17/24) [External Link]: https://crooked.com/podcast/is-biden-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'It feels like Biden has been quiet quitting for the better part of two years. I can’t remember what he’s done since the midterms. And if I can’t remember and I listen to every episode of this podcast, it’s no wonder half the electorate couldn’t remember either.'",
        "In response to 'They can’t be serious, defending the time change.\nLOL \nLiterally, nobody wants that.\nAlso, it’s not practical for some states to observe it and other states not widely across the board as they suggest. Very strange argument. I know there’s a couple of examples right now, such as Arizona, but imagine the US were half the states observed the time change and half don’t. It makes no sense.', a user said: 'Lots of people want the time change. It’s very popular in WA state. But we want permanent daylight saving time. If we had permanent standard time, it would get light at 4am in Seattle in the summer. I would rather have a dark morning in the winter and an extra hour of daylight in the afternoon. It currently gets dark before 4pm here.'"
