        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Not to get downvoted into oblivion, but I would've at least tried calling before canceling the order and being passive aggressive with the customer. Like i would try any possible means of communication before doing that.\nThere seems to be about a five-ten minute delay in the app when it comes to messaging, at least in my area. Delivered to my cousin Monday and messaged him to tell him it was me and i was on my way over. Then when I got there, he was surprised to see me and he finally got a notification for my message when we were already in the middle of chatting.\nNot knocking OP, but imo they overreacted and could've resolved the situation with a phone call.'"
