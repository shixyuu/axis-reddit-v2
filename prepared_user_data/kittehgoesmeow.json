        "In response to 'Original Post: [Discussion] Pod Save America - \"Is Biden Quiet Quitting?\" (12/17/24) [External Link]: https://crooked.com/podcast/is-biden-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'synopsis:\nJoe Biden cedes the spotlight to Donald Trump, who’s rolling like he’s already taken office: meeting with world leaders, attending the annual Army-Navy game, and calmly announcing the next targets in his legal offensive against the media. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss what Biden could and should be doing in the final weeks of his presidency, what ABC’s settlement with Trump says about the state of political media, the mysterious drone-like things over New Jersey, and Trump’s pledge to end Daylight Saving Time. Then, Rep. Ro Khanna stops by to talk with Jon about how Democrats in the next Congress can strike the balance between resisting Trump and getting things done, and why he’s willing to collaborate with Elon Musk on DOGE.\nyoutube version'"
