        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: '2021 was my burnout year, so I quiet quit over 2022/2023. Resigned early 2024, went overseas for many months and have returned to a 4 day a week cruisy but low paying role and trying to enjoy life. Going well so far'"
