I work in a factory, and they consider reading a book a waste of time.\nI could spend the hours of downtime BSing with coworkers no problem, but open a book and someone will come over to tell you to stop it.', a user said: 'This happened to me once during my lunch break... I will say, this was more of a shit manager situation than company wide. Needless to say, I don't work for that person or company anymore.'",

Leave me alone in 30 minutes I will get back to work.\"', a user said: 'Appreciate the response. In this case, they weren't telling me to do work but said, \"would you want the CEO to see you reading at your desk?\"\nI was younger and dumber than I am now.'"
