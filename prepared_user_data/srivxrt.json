        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I was part of the great resignation in 2022, moved companies from management to a technical role. Been doing the minimum since (while claiming to be great). Since then I got promoted without asking for it (still no staff to manage) but no real extra stress.'"
