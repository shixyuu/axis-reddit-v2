        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I “quiet quit” in 2020 (possibly before the term was properly coined?) and went back to uni while still “working full-time” (studying part-time). I basically just got paid to do my uni work. Finished my degree in 2023 and proper quit to start working in the area I did the extra study.'"
