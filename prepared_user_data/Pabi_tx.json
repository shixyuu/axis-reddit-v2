        "In response to 'Wage compression:\nWhen companies offer higher starting salaries to attract new talent without adjusting the pay of current employees\nBasically, the minimum wage jumped in my state, and now they need to offer higher pay to attract new employees, but they didn't adjust the scale for existing workers. I started at this job making $12/hr, which was $3 over minimum wage at the time, and now, after 9 years, I'm making $19/hr - which looks good on paper, except the state minimum wage is now $16/hr, so I'm still making $3 over minimum wage.\nThe worst part is that I'm expected to train kids walking in the door, making as much or more than me, who were in middle school when I started here.', a user said: 'When companies offer higher starting salaries to attract new talent without adjusting the pay of current employees\nI had the talk with my boss of over 10 years earlier this year. \"How much would you have to pay someone you hire to replace me to do all the things I do? OK then why has the company consistently given lower-than-inflation raises since forever? Why do you value someone who's\nnot\non the team more than someone who knows where the bodies are buried?\"\nGot a raise.'"
