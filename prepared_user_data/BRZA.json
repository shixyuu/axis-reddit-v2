The CEO’s and corporate media have flipped it to sound like it’s a moral failing that  more workers are no longer willing to sacrifice their work life balance.  Meanwhile, they will skirt over the fact many take advantage of workers via increased workloads via job cuts to boost short term profits. Create environments where it’s discouraged to take time off, encouraged to work longer hours to “be a team player” etc…. But, yeah the guy showing up doing what his agreed upon job, despite the adversarial conditions is the problem.'"
