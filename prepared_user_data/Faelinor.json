[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/zyuip9dwb68a1.png', a user said: 'See, the term quiet quitting resonated with me. I never saw it as any kind of like, victim blaming or anything like that. I actually thought it was quite good. Though I never exactly worked outside of my job role or hours. But I did just stop caring. If things weren't done on time, that's on the boss, not me, because they didn't plan their time very well. It really helped with like, stress. I stopped caring and therefore stress didn't hit. And then if they got mad, I just didn't care anymore. Like it's not my problem. It was nice to have a phrase that matched with what I was already doing. For a long time. I mean I still bitched and moaned about the boss. But only because I found them annoying, the stress disappeared and every night when I went home I slept like a baby, compared to when I used to worry about the next day.'"
