        "In response to 'Original Post: Companies Decide to Keep Four-Day Workweek After Finding It's Better | So-called \"quiet quitting\" could decrease if companies move to a four-day workweek, an ongoing UK study finds. [External Link]: https://gizmodo.com/four-day-workweek-remote-work-tech-jobs-1850139680', a user said: 'I work 4x10. It's pretty nice in my opinion. 3 days off ain't bad.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'I agree that quiet quitting and sticking to your hours are two very different things.\nWorking under your contract hours is just... working. ðŸ¤­'"
