        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'just to be clear, by 'quiet-quit' we mean people who stopped doing unpaid overtime or extra work and just scaled down to their contracted work/hours?'",
        "In response to 'What the academic world calls “work to rule” the mass media has spun as a horrific negative thing called “quiet quitting”.\nYes. They mean doing exactly what’s in your contract … because god forbid we get a fair exchange as an employee', a user said: 'Lol, “work to rule” doesn’t seem any clearer. Anyway I think a less defined aspect of quiet quitting is that the person no longer believes in the job or business and is giving the bare minimum, with an eye to moving on.\nBut yeah to call scaling back from unpaid overtime to simply contracted expectations “quiet quitting” is so horrible.'",
        "In response to 'The quiet quitting movement was great, it allowed me to identify all the dead weight in the team, as well as identifying redundancy candidates. Great work team!', a user said: 'ah, the corporate obsession of 'dead weight''"
