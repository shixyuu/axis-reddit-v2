        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Story time 🧐: I quit my toxic ex job about 6 months ago. Was working about 12h every day, roughly from 8am to 8pm. Was constantly pushed to take more responsibility from my manager even when  it was clear the company had extreme resource issues and one person couldn’t do the work of 3. The upper management hired mostly Junior people, with just a few who made it above that minimal salary after several years. The welcome message was essentially “SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE LUCKY TO BE IN YOUR SPOT”. The turnover was BAD. People came in and went out for good in a period shorter than 6 months - 1 year as soon as their burnout point activated. I turned out to be one of them. At some point I was mentally (that contributed: I wasn’t allowed to go home for the holidays as you could only claim work from home after passing probation) and physically exhausted. My body literally said you cannot work like this anymore. So I started looking for another job. Found my dream job. At an amazing organisation (basically the university student in me is still screaming in bliss).  When I had a final chat with the CEO of ex company and laid down all issues I’ve encountered and basic solutions for all of those I was told  and I kid you not: “Hm idk you never seemed to struggle too much, you know it’s normal with the dynamics of our work. Also, YOUR WORKLOAD DOESN’T SEEM TO MATCH THE HOURS YOU’RE CLAIMING.” I never actually claimed extra hours. No one did. The culture was about still being at your desk at 7pm. That was the moment I realised I’ve made one of the best decisions in my life leaving this company. Not only was I stretched out with turning over several projects per day, but my efforts were apparently not even seen by upper management.\nThis week my current manager checked on me countless times to make sure I don’t work after 5pm and his words: “enjoy life, work will always be here waiting :)”\nI don’t mean this in any cheeky way, I love working hard. I really do. I take my work home always and I take pride in the results. But work isn’t everything. I felt so incredibly ashamed that I quit a job before the mark of 6 months (I managed 5 and 1 week). I’ve learnt that when a job place is bad for you, you really should just quit - no shame, no guilt, and quick before your mental health is deteriorating, rip it like dirty bandaid lol. Just a conscious choice to live a better life :)'"
