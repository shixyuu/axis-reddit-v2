        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'Yes, and I'm doing it intentionally.'",
        "In response to 'What’s quiet quitting', a user said: 'Fancy way of saying\nwork to contract as much as you can while saying no to extra duties or responsibilities.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'Haven't heard that excuse, but even if they use it, I'll shrug it off.\nIf you want to fail, fail.'",
        "In response to 'But will they? Enter admin and intervention.', a user said: 'Can't grade what isn't turned in.'"
