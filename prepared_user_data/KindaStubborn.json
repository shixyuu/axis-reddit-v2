        "In response to 'Volunteering, no.  Not my job.\nTaking over new responsibilities that are part of the job description for other people, no. Not my job - literally someone else's.\nGrading/planning at home...yes.\nThis isa salaried job, not an hourly one, and we do not WANT to be treated like clock workers- it's bad for kids, and bad for professionals.\nIf you're being asked to write LONGER plans than before, you negotiate it as a salary bump.  Same with adding to our plates.  Our job is not \"working as long as we are in the building\".  That's not what salaries do - and our contracts\ndistinguish\nclearly, and on purpose, between \"in building hours\" and responsibilities, and sometimes we do a few hours of that at home - just like lawyers and doctors do.', a user said: 'Have you ever worked in the private sector? I have -- for almost 20 years. And working at home after a full day at the office was the exception, not the rule.'"
