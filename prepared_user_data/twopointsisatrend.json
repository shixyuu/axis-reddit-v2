        "In response to 'My boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work\nI wouldn't count on that meaning anything to do. Your boss's boss keeps your boss around...', a user said: 'OP got a raise that probably only happened due to boss's boss.\nFrom the big boss's standpoint, they are meeting their metrics so what's their answer going to be when the boss asks why they are being let go? OP mentioned a three person team. Is it just OP that doesn't get along? Boss might frame it that way, even if not true. Also, replacing them doesn't mean that they'll find someone who's better. There's always that risk. Big boss may be waiting for the boss to retire. I wouldn't put a lot of blame on them. They may even be looking to promote OP when the boss retires.'"
