        "In response to 'Original Post: My cousin is SFPD and has the same take on the bikers. Are we basically just paying them 3/4 $billion a year to cry and quiet quit? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/uhdkr8xy39ld1.jpeg', a user said: 'Drives me crazy. When my place was broken into, SFPD officer literally told me that he wasn't going to bother investigating because the voters put \"that new DA in office\". HUH!? It's your job. Instead of quiet quitting, why don't you make the DA look like a idiot (as if he needed help), by arresting criminals and showing the DA won't try them, or judges won't convict them?\nInstead, definitely feels like SFPD has just thrown up their collective hands and opted to do nothing instead, and blame others for it.'"
