        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'why shouldn't you be replaced with someone who might?\nBecause the replacement in on itself is another cost. It costs money to have recruiters search for a candidate, to have recruiters and engineer screen and interview those candidates, to pay the newhire's onboarding (often including buying a laptop, having IT configure it for the new hire, creating the new hire's AD user, configuring proper accesses in the dozen internal tools used, etc) and to have other engineers help the new hire get up to speed to the new company which based on my experience being both a new hire and a new hire's mentor that can take several weeks before the new hire starts to actually provide value where the company had to pay for both the new hire's salary as well as mine while I was not providing value to the company but helping the new hire get up to speed.\nAnd this is not even mentioning the fact that a new hire on average receives a better wage than the equivalent coworker that was already there at the company.\nAnd finally this is all with the possible outcome that the new hire ends up being another employee that just does their job and does not go above and beyond for the company (or even worse, an employee that does not even do their job well).'"
