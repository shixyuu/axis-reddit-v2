Definitely don’t complain to your boss because she doesn’t care about your feelings. she just wants work done. The best thing is just to slow your work down because you’re unfireable and if she complains to you about your work slowing down just say you’re trying your hardest. It works for me in my govt job.', a user said: 'Unbelievably pathetic.'"
