        "In response to 'As a recent grad who started a career this year, I'm so confused by \"quiet quitting\" and why anyone would be upset at it. I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'The sudden spike in the use of this term really makes me think it's some kind of consulting group marketing pushback against millennial/genz wholesale rejection of \"going above and beyond gets you ahead\" philosophy.\nMaybe managers should put their MBA hats on and realize bitching about \"quiet quitting\" in an era of no raises, record inflation, and peak labor demand is stupid.\nRational actors do what's in their best interest. It's not complicated, they're just on the disadvantageous side of it right now.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting is the only response acceptable to Quiet Firing [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/rhhn62s8a13e1.png', a user said: 'Quiet promoting where they keep increasing your responsibilities without increasing your pay.'",
        "In response to 'There's no reward for hard work anymore so why do it? Do the minimum and find fulfillment in your life outside of work.', a user said: 'When I was still relatively new at my current job, my manager inspired me with the “for the good of the group” speech. I went in to cover some work on my day off that week. Worked 5 hours, freed up someone else’s time so they could get some training done. I got no “thank you” or anything similar; in fact, I was reprimanded for not volunteering more. I learned then that the reward for working hard and working more is…. More work. That’s not a good deal in my eyes, so I think I’ll stick to my normal 40 hours and spend my free time with my cat.'"
