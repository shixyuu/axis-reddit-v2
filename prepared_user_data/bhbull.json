If you want you car to run at that speed, well... it will certainly cost you.\nI really hate how this corporate hustle culture eventually became a scam to have workers give their 100% while giving them a 20% salary. What was the point of that in the first place? Why did we allow ourselves to be used like that? I remember people shitting on the french for being on strike all the time, supposedly being \"lazy\" and demanding their rights. Guess what? They are correct and we were the suckers.\nPaying X and getting X\n10\ndoes not apply anywhere else in the market, (certainly not profesional services) why are employees any different?', a user said: 'French do it right. Unions will go on strike together, even if unrelated fields, cause they know they are all in this together.'",
        "In response to 'Sympathy strikes are illegal in the US. We should do it anyways—the right to strike was not always legal anyways—but there are definitely significant barriers in the neoliberalized western countries to this.', a user said: 'Well, the whole thing with legal vs illegal strikes baffles me. The point is disrupting the system until things change. Of course the system is going to make it illegal. Used to be illegal for women to vote.'"
