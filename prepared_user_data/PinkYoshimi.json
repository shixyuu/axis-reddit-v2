I had a breaking point a few days ago and texted my partner that I’m putting in my two weeks as soon as we get back from a planned vacation. He has been nothing but supportive, and was very happy to hear that I’ve finally planned an exit. We’ve gotten to the point where I can’t even really talk about work anymore because we both know it’s an unhealthy situation.'"
