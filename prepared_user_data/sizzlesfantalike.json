        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'Damn my husband hasn’t taken over my quiet quitting. The house is a goddamn mess.'",
        "In response to 'You are rewarded though. It’s called a paycheck. \nI can’t grasp the concept of quiet quitting. It’s always been: \nI clocked in, what do want me to do!\nI can clean toilets with a tooth brush, I can balance the accounting books, I will even perform surgery if needed.\nAbout 5 years ago, when I give people their yearly review, I started giving them a copy of their job description too. Just to refresh themselves if they wanted too.', a user said: 'What job is requiring you to balance book and be a janitor? Unless you own the business, employees aren’t getting equity from doing more. The paycheck is for services rendered in their job description. Why would you do more?'"
