If it wasn’t such a relief I’d have given him some shit cause I always see them busting balls on all the Mexicans and other browner folks up and down that road, but he just gave me a friendly warning and sent me on my way.  So fucking weird.', a user said: 'I was driving down s.Congress right out of downtown before Barton Springs.  Trooper was on a motorcycle going north.
