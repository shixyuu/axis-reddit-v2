        "In response to 'Im wondering if someone my age even has a chance to work up in amazon. I’m a rehire but before I asked to do a lot of things, like problem solver. I’m 41 and I didn’t see anyone above probably 30 working in higher positions and most of the problem solvers were like 19. One of the kids on the AR floor looked 12. My AM was most likely 20 years old..\nI was always in the top 15 for stowing in the building, I had good work ethic but they passed me up for problem solving twice. I didn’t bring attention to myself and didn’t cause drama. I even got a shoutout during stand up in pack while I was cross training for doing such a good job my 3rd day. Still.. nothing. I signed up for every thing but was never picked. I’m going into outbound this time so hopefully it’ll be different.', a user said: 'Im 55, currently an PA, became a Pa at 50. I started working at Amazon as a rehire at 43. It can be done but its a little harder. I had to actually change buildings to get promoted because the managers at my old building had their pets and I was not one of them.'"
