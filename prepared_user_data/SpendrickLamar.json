        "In response to 'Quiet quitting? No. But I've been \"acting my wage\" for the past 3 years.\nNo lesson planning until I'm at school. I do it the morning of. They require us to be on campus 30 min early so now I have a use for that time.\nI grade during our stupid biweekly meetings.\nNo kids are allowed in my room during my lunch. No kids are allowed to remain in my room once my contract hours are over.\nI get 12 sick days and so I take at least 1 \"mental health\" day a month and do nothing school related.\nI told the principal last year I'm not supervising the exchange student visits or an annual culture festival anymore because it's all unpaid work. This year I told my club officers they need to find a new club supervisor.\nIt's had zero impact on my evaluations. I'm still a highly rated teacher. Enrollment demand for my classes had increased enormously. I go on dates after work even during the weekday now.', a user said: 'I'm a second year teacher and I already do the \"figure it out in the morning\". Works everytime actually lol'"
