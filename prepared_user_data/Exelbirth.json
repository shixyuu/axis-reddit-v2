        "In response to 'Original Post: /u/x_v_b explains how the sudden ubiquity of the buzz-phrase \"quiet quitting\" is really just a PR exercise to discourage workers from standing up against wage theft by employers [External Link]: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/x0feqg/whats_up_with_all_these_articles_about_quiet/im91pkm/?context=3', a user said: 'Here's a crazy thing:  I saw a fox news video pop up in my recommendations about this.  I figured, why not see what fox viewers are saying about it.  To my surprise, there was more comments backing the idea of \"quiet quitting\" than opposing it.  Sure, there were those arguing working unpaid overtime was reward enough because \"you get to hone your skills and increase your value,\" or demonstrating a lack of historical knowledge and saying unpaid interns are fine because apprentices in the past worked with no pay (we have documentation showing they were paid, plus given free housing, food, and clothes by their teachers).  Still, it was surprising.'"
