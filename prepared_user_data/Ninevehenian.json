        "In response to '\"Quiet quitting\" is such a stupid term.', a user said: 'Not stupid, it is hostile. It is a way to attack society.'",
        "In response to 'How, how is this attacking society?', a user said: 'It's a narrative employed by the oligarchs to suppress people who work for a living.\nThe narrative only happens in oligarch owned media that has an interest in portraying people doing their work as something negative.\nPeople who \"work for a living\", that's also known as society.\nThe phrase: \"Quiet quitting\" is invented by media such as \"Fortune\" and their allied publications. It's not something that originates from people, it's not something where the ethics of it is considered with reasonable motives.'"
