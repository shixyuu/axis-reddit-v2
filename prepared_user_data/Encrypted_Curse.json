        "In response to 'I’d just like to let you know that school doesn’t cost 20k per year anymore. Here is an article saying total costs in the cheapest group (in state public universities) average around 27k/year. If you look at the other groups, they are much worse. For the worst group (private universities) you could accrue over 215k in debt over four years.\n10k isn’t even enough to get people out of the hole enough that they can start paying off the interest at an appreciable rate', a user said: 'I have no idea where you're getting the $27K/year figure.\nhttps://www.ontocollege.com/average-college-tuition/\nThis link says the average is $9K, which is in line with my own experience.'"
