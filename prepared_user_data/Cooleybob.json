If you made $100 million in Q2, you better have a very good excuse if you don't make $150 million in Q3.\nThere's so much toxicity and rot in the pursuit of continuous growth. Countries define their economic prosperity on how much their GDP increases year over year, on a planet with finite room for growth.'"
