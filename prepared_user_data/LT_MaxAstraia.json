        "In response to 'Can't stand when people magically lose their phone or tell me it died after placing an order.  I do screenshot my call log and send it to door dash when disputes happen regarding my attempts to reach a customer.', a user said: 'GenX story time.  I started delivering pizza before cell phones, in the mid 90's.  When people didn't answer their door, I had to drive to a PAYPHONE to call them.  Usually it was some dumb shit like they were in the shower, or since we quoted 30-40 minutes they figured they had time to run to the store.  The more things change, yada yada yada.'"
