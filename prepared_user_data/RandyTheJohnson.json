        "In response to 'if they are asked to work over 8 hours in a day, they are required to get paid overtime\nNope. I do wish it was on a day by day basis. That means I would have gotten overtime for all of the shifts I had to work late because the next person didn’t show up to the hotel on time for their shift.\nIf they\ngo over 40 hours during a work week\nthey will be paid overtime for any hours over 40 that they work. In actuality, what happens is they will send you home early as soon as they realize that you are about to hit 40 hours near the end of the week. That way you end up working an 8+ hour shift or two at the start of the week, and then a short shift later in the week so you stay under 40 hours. It’s absolute bullshit.', a user said: 'In CA at least it is either. >8 hours is time and a half, >40 in a week is also time and a half. If you're doing >8 when you've already worked 40 then you're getting double OT for 2x pay. But good luck finding a full time job when they know it's cheaper to hire two people part time'"
