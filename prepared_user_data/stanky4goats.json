        "In response to '💯agree with you. Last year I really made an effort to leave work right on time. I wasn’t staying just to finish work I could do the next day. I don’t stay to “chat” with coworkers talking about work because it’s not worth it, I just bounce and leave once my time is done. I think that simple thing for me has helped me tremendously because I’m putting myself first.', a user said: 'Same dawg. I recently heard one of the older workers (in his 50/60s) that the younger generation must not work hard enough because they have \"so much energy running to the door\" at the end of the day.\nI told him that's because the older generation was told, \"Work hard and you'll be rewarded!\" ... the younger generation, on the other hand, knows that's a load of crap. So we do our job and go home.\nWhat's the point of going above and beyond if you're not compensated for it?'"
