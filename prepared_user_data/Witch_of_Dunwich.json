Anything more than that is sacrificing my time for no extra gain.', a user said: 'People need to be careful repeating this narrative - a lot of contracts have wording or a clause about successful completion of duties (i.e. you ARE paid for 37.5 hours per week, but if you cannot successfully complete the required work in this time, the work takes precedent over your scheduled hours).\nEdit: not saying yours definitely says this, but as someone who has worked in HR for many years across different companies, itâ€™s really common.'"
