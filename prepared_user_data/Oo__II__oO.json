I went out and found another dog shit job almost immediately', a user said: 'The best part is you have the experience of that previous dog shit job as a launching off point.  Growing up everyone knew who the managers were of those outfits, and if you could hack it working for them for anything past the probationary period, you were going to be a valued worker at your next place.\nThe good hiring managers didn't exclude people for having the misfortune of working for an asshole, and saw it as a positive trait.'"
