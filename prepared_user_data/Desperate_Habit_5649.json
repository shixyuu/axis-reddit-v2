        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses?\nIt`s been going on for decades...\nBefore the Internet there were`nt many people you could talk to...Now we`re finding out a lot of people had the same Idea...\nIf you want peace in your life, Leave Quietly.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah been going on from middle of the 90s. People just fade. Half empty congregation everywhere. Mostly Old people. Wonder how org gonna look in 5-10 years. Good times deffently ended for watchtower', a user said: 'Good times deffently ended for watchtower\nYa...\nThe Glory Days are over, post 1975 was the beginning of the decline...Internet accelerated that...Forums like this amplify it by 1,000 %.\nâ€‹\nThe WBT$ / JW Cult...\nWill NEVER Be What it Was.'"
