        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'Prioritising what your boss wants first instead of your overall performance.\n\"I'm sorry but boss A said this needs doing first\"\n\"I'm sorry I was pulled on a performance of a certain task, i must focus of completing the said task instead of helping with anyrhing else, if this is of urgency please clear with my boss\"'",

But i will do what you ask since my job is on the line. (This i keep to myself, obviously)'"
