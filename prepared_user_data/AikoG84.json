        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'It's because american companies think they own the workers. They kinda do in some ways. We are dependant on them to have healthcare. It's almost impossible to see a doctor without insurance simply because of how expensive it is. The generations before (boomers mostly) would pit in 80 hours a week on a 40 hour salary position that was exempt from overtime and not complain.\nThat time is over now. The younger generations have hobbies and lives we want to live. We'll gladly leave for something that offers a better work/life balance and not think twice about it.'"
