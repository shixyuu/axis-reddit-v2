        "In response to 'The term is a misnomer started in a TikTok video that went viral and was picked up by the media. It is actually a concept called Work to Rule which is the concept that you just do the bare minimum for what you are paid to do and do not go above and beyond. In the US, though, work culture has been formed to expect employees to go \"above and beyond\" and we as workers have been conditioned to grind and do the most. People are discovering that all that hard work and sacrifice is only getting us more work and no more pay. Now that people are just doing what they are paid to do, corporations and businesses are panicking because they are losing productivity and the free labor they are used to having. We are all saying, no. We aren't working for free anymore.', a user said: 'Yeah it’s bullshit.  I love the US but we have been brainwashed and lied to when it comes to workers rights and conditions.  Probably worst of the 1st world.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'All I know is fuck employers.  They cry when everything and I mean everything doesn’t go their way.'"
