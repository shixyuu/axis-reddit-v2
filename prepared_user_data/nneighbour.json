No, it's just work-to-rule — and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'I used to do a lot of above and beyond for my employer. I was doing a whole bunch of unpaid overtime. Then they thanked me for it. I realized their $125 thank you gift card was for $5000 of free labour. It was honestly the best thing they could have done for me as I vowed to never burn myself out for the company again. I haven’t worked any overtime since and have switched to a less-stressful position. My work-life balance has never been better.'"
