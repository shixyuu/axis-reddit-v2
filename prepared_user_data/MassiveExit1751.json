        "In response to 'Original Post: I got promoted while quiet quiting My j1 is boring and has a lot of meetings, so I decided to quit and search for a new J, that was months ago. I accepted j3 and for the last 3 months I did a total of 0 commits, I just go to meetings and pretend I do some shit\nI just got off my 1:1 with my manager, and got promoted to senior backend dev. I will get a raise of 15%\nLife is funny sometimes', a user said: 'Wait till you get to architect you can just throw out that you need more time to conceptualize throw in a buzz word or two and that buys you at least 3 to 4 weeks at 2 of my Js. J3 will give even more time and offer up a junior resource eager to learn to basically be a lackey or ask do we need to add a headcount to take some of the \"low hanging fruit\" off your plate.\nInterestingly enough, I get to see both sides as my bread and butter is a Fortune 500 level leadership role.

One boomer we'll call him Bob pulled me to the side and said a combination of look kid you're working too hard and to slow down. I knew it wasn't a long-term gig or even in my desired field. However, I still wanted to do my best and leave a good impression.\nFew days after the Bob conversation above, the manager hits me with the anonymous some folks told me blah blah the sleeping part. I was so pissed rest of summer I'd clock in immediately go to my car and actually sleep for my entire shift then clockout. Same manager before I went back to school, it was a pleasure to have you, thanks for being coachable and welcome back anytime. The icing on the cake manager goes I know you're good with computers we may even have a back office internship as well next summer ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£'"
