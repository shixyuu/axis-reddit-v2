Quiet quitting would make me feel really icky. A true professional puts in a respectable shift while finding another job.'",
        "In response to 'This is how I always felt too. I mentioned it in the post. I was always of the opinion that \"bruh, why would you quiet quit? Just find a better job where you feel more fulfilled and leave\".\nThe issue now is that I am sending out so many applications and going through SO much emotional energy investment doing interviews, filling out custom-tailored applications that are of high quality, and so forth - and I feel trapped at this job. I can't just quit without something lined up and I can't line something up that is LESS shitty overall than what I have', a user said: 'I can't just quit without something lined up\nThat's smart.\nI'm not saying I'd kill myself, but I'd put in an honest shift that I can be proud of, and I highly doubt that will get any high achiever fired. Finding meaning in less than perfect situations is a skill that's well worth acquiring.\nIt can always be worse.\nGood luck, and I hope the current comes back your way.'"
