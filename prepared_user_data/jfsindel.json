They were happy acting like \"patriot men\" for their organization, willing to die, and shooting things that they perceived as weak or inferior. Did it for two decades.\nNow there's \"peacetime\" for them (got what they wanted) and... it's boring. It might even be considered \"women's work\" because you stay inside and barely work with your hands.\nThey say a lot of gung-ho soldiers have a harder time in peace than in war.'"
