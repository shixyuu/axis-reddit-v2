        "In response to 'that is how it should be. I'm not working 4 x 10 hour days.  Study after study shows that only about 5 to 6 hours of true work gets done in a day.  The other 2 are just waiting for the clock to run down because it's a long day.', a user said: 'I work in IT and they have a lot of our service desk employees on 4x10 and you can just see it in their eyes and hear it in their voice that after about 6 hours they're done mentally. Unfortunately service desk is similar to call center work and there's always work to be done so its 10 full hours of mentally straining work so I don't ever seeing my field move towards it - if anyone knows any tech company hiring for 4x8 that pays the same as 5x8 let me know lol'",
        "In response to 'Programmer here. In my department people usually start work around 7-8am. It is noticeable past 2pm that people are tired and spend more time on couches chit-chatting or playing PS4.', a user said: 'I wish, I work from 6am to 3pm and its non-stop for me. I do access management through Active Directory. Really regretting giving up on coding in highschool now. I don't hate my job or anything it just can be a lot of work at times, and I really wish I could just play wow or hogwarts for half of my day lol'"
