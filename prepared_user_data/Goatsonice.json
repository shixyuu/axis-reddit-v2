        "In response to 'People are tired of constantly being asked for free work by bosses filled with promises that never happen.\nAn example I used long ago when a manager was wondering why I was only doing what was in my job description...\n\"You keep demanding extra fries for free and are surprised I'm not bringing them to the table for you?\"\nIt's really not hard to pay for your damn fries.', a user said: 'On an anecdotal level I agree. My employer just killed 100% WFH, wants me to commute an extra 4 hours a day into the office for 0 pay increase, effectively a massive pay cut. I'm already putting out new applications but this entire idea of the american workplace needs to be shaken up, the whole reason I accepted the job was the remote. The city it's in is extremely expensive where my salary would barely be able to afford a bad apartment.'"
