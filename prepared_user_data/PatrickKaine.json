        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'My personal issue is that I am still motivated to move at a fast pace but my team is not and I’m in tech sales so need engineers to design the solution before I can go to the next step. They are over worked and slow due to this and maybe WFH, hard to know.\nIt’s also difficult to do the best part of the job now - which is relationship building and entertaining - as most customers are remote too.\nI’m keeping the faith and doing my best. Joined the country club and take my anger out at the little white ball a few times a week.'"
