        "In response to 'This. For years I've been one of the highest performing employees in the office. However, my pay is barely above what they pay new hires that aren't even half as productive as me. For the last couple years I haven't cared about my productivity. I work at a comfortable pace and I'm about average now.\nWhen my boss inquired about my drop in productivity I told them they could always incentivize me to perform better. When I compared my wage to others I determined they're paying for my time and not for my productivity. If they want me to be a better than average employee they should pay me more than the average employee. Instead I was told I get paid for the job I do and that if I want a higher wage then I'll need to move up in the company.\nSince then I maintain average productivity. I'm not quiet quitting. I'm doing the job I'm paid to do at the level they pay me to do it. Employers need to learn that they get what they pay for and hopefully this trend continues because it's the only way they'll learn.', a user said: 'I advised if you can to look for employment elsewhere. That is how you secure a pay raise these days'"
