        "In response to 'It can mean wildly different things depending on who you ask\nTo some it’s “do the absolute bare minimum to put off being fired as long as possible”, and to others it’s just “don’t go above and beyond”', a user said: 'This is so weird to me. Why is it called 'quitting' if you're trying to keep the job? I always assumed it meant you want to quit, but instead of quitting now you just start doing a lazy job instead. You assume they'll eventually fire you for it, but you wait it out and keep collecting the paycheck until they do.\nThere are plenty of jobs where it can take a while for the bosses to realize you're being a \"bad\" employee. You wouldn't act that way if you want to succeed, but you can also coast for a while before getting canned if you don't care about getting fired.\nI think maybe that mentality transferred over to a different type of job? Because like I said, I've always heard \"quiet quitting\" as an actual way of quitting. So it definitely changed meanings to some people.'",
        "In response to 'But I guess I’m confused why doing the bare minimum is considered quiet quitting. Isn’t that what the job description says? If you’re hitting your minimum performance metrics, and for us it’s easy because it’s just “Did you do your stories or not?”, I don’t know why that would ever get your fired eventually.', a user said: 'The meaning changed. Quiet quitting is a way of quitting. Doing a job poorly enough that you do expect to be fired, but you're ready to quit anyway so instead you just coast along collecting a paycheck until they fire you.\nApparently some people use the word now to just mean limiting how hard they work, generally.'"
