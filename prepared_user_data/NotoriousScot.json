        "In response to 'First, your feelings of stress, overwhelm, frustration, and despair, are all valid things to feel. Most people would probably feel the same way in your situation You're not wrong, stupid, or crazy to feel the way you do.\nAt the same time, your feelings are not entirely based on facts.\nIt seems like, to some extent, what may currently feel like an impossible problem, is not actually as big a problem as it seems to be.\nYes, the job market is pretty rough out there. Yes, you are in a situation where your current bosses expect you to over-perform, and might be pretty annoyed if you drop down to baseline.\nThose things are outside your locus of control. They are real, they are affecting your situation. But, while your decision-making should take that context into account, that should not be the focus of your solution.\nYour solution should be focused on the things you can do to go from where you are now to where you want to be.\nFrom the outside looking in, the solution to your problem is pretty simple:\nFirst, keep looking for a new job. It sucks that your past attempts have not worked. Keep going.\nSecond, consider getting some career and job application advice. It might be that you are doing something small to undermine your chances. In this hyper-competitive environment, outside feedback can often help.\nThird, start to think in an open-minded way about how you might widen your search. You might have to go in an unexpected direction for a while. You took this job as a means to an end -- but it might turn out, things being what they are in 2025, that you might have to go left when you planned to go right -- or even go purple or banana or something totally outside the box.\nWhen it comes to your current job, my best advice is, if you really are doing twice or three times the workload and have a much higher operational proficiency, client satisfaction, etc, to drop down the amount you are currently working, but not to zero or baseline.\nWhat would it look like to outperform the rest of your team by 105% or 110% instead of 200%-300%? What would it look like to be the top performer on your team by a small but significant amount?\nBe very smart about setting that as your goal, and then do the work to accomplish that goal and no more.\nIf you get bad reviews or feedback, or put on a PIP, my advice is to not care very much about that.\nYour managers aren't teachers in school, they aren't mom and dad, they aren't people you always need to keep happy with you at all costs.\nYou are currently placing too much emphasis on keeping authority figures always happy with you, no matter the personal cost.\nIn a situation where an authority figure is a helpful, wise mentor, that can be a good thing.\nIn a situation where an authority figure does not have your interests in mind, and is only trying to squeeze as much productivity out of you as possible while you burn out and experience extreme emotional distress, trying to keep them happy at all costs is actually really dangerous.\nIf a job/employer demonstrates that they will not reward you for going above and beyond, you can simply choose to stop going above and beyond.\nI'm sure when your productivity drops, they will be annoyed at you. But, ultimately, in my opinion, that's only your problem in as much as it's your problem.\nIf you are professional and polite, it is unlikely that they will fire someone who has dropped down significantly but remains a top performer.\nUltimately, again, all of your stresses and fears are valid. But a lot of this problem is emotional/mental (though still real and valid). \"Someone will be disappointed in me\" and \"I will get put on a PIP\" -- these are not the failures that your emotions are telling you they are.\nA job is a partnership. When a company demonstrates that they are not looking out for you, your responsibility is to be realistic, understand the power they do hold over you (ie compensation and potentially firing you) and make smart, rational, self-interested decisions based on that context. You don't owe anyone overperformance and exhaustion just because they will be annoyed at you if you don't give it to them.', a user said: 'Excellent advice.'"
