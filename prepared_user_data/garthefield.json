        "In response to 'Burnt out, yes. Considering a completely different career path. Monthly quota is wearing me down — especially not hitting it these past few months — the pressure looms outside of work and the dread coming back on a Monday isn’t healthy.\nI’m still relatively young (4 years out of uni) but as an introvert I don’t know if I can mentally handle being a full cycle rep of making 50 calls a day plus doing demos and closing deals.\nI love being rewarded for your performance unlike other jobs, and I get to build trust with people and help solve their problems, and I enjoy the grind. But with so many things out of my control (DMs pushing deals months out) it’s freaking tough to keep level headed. I realize why the drinking culture is so rampant in sales.\nI honestly don’t know what to do — been in my role 6 months, I’m building better habits around sleep, mental health, eating, and exercise but I haven’t seen a lasting change. I’m normally an anxious person so I’ll admit maybe I’m just not cut out for the constant pressure sales brings when you’re not doing well.', a user said: 'In pretty much the same boat as you. 3.5 years out of uni, 1.5 in current role Enterprise Staffing Sales. The not having control over outcomes part is definitely the worst and I feel like I've had so many large deals go cold out of nowhere, which just makes everything a rollercoaster of emotions.\nAm fairly extroverted, however do have GAD and makes it hard sometimes to make a ton of calls as I'm too analytical/inwardly focused sometimes. I definitely did develop a drinking problem early on in sales lol but got sober a while back'"
