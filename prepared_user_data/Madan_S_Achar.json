        "In response to 'One of the most important points discussed here is upskilling in terms of soft skills. I've joined the largest consulting services in the world and i now realize how beneficial it is to be good at communicating effectively even when you're under intense pressure, pissed of at your manager, coworker client& what not. \nGuys, if any of you think you have something valuable to share on this topic. Please go ahead!', a user said: 'Definitely! Communication for me personally is a major contributor to the growth in my career than my technical expertise. Despite 3 years into the field I still feel my technical skills are lacking compared to an average cs grad who's been programming since college, but I knew just the right things (currently in pursuit of learning and upskilling) and the means to convey them. Not many in corporate get in trouble for not knowing stuff, but they do get in trouble if they don't ask questions and learn. And you need to have the communication skills to ask the right questions and also give answers when it's the other way around. I've met many peers who have the technical prowess, but lack in communication which creates a huge gap between your own fellow teammates and managers.'",
        "In response to 'What‚Äôs the success metric though?\nWe might be running the same rat race. But, we‚Äôve started running from different starting points, and we‚Äôre probably running towards different finish lines.', a user said: 'Exactly the term success has kinda lost its meaning when it's  expected to be the same for everyone. \"Work hard and success will find you\" is just blindly thrown around without any consideration of what success is to that person. Doing the bare minimum which meets the role requirements and the paycheck comes off lazy and unmotivated, instead if I elaborate on the work that I do the way I do with my peers it'll be considered as a good job or even impressive. What people are failing to see is that doing bare minimum is still doing a really good job and also have enough time to do more but refusing to do so cuz you don't really gain much out of it from the job and company perspective.'",
        "In response to 'Exactly why I made my point. The work ethic you go by will surely get you to the finish line but it will not be according to your expectations. Success is not the acquisition of resources or property, but the reward of reaching the finish line. In other words success is saved for the completion of a journey and not for the journey. Also there is only one finish line- on your death bed, what will give you satisfaction?', a user said: 'I do agree with success being a reward at the end of any pursuit. But personally it is much wider than just achieving in a corporate job even though it is a significant part of my life. I definitely want to reach great heights in my career, and I will work hard to reach them. But that doesn't mean all my hard work will go into that goal alone. What will give me satisfaction on my death bed is when I look back I don't want to feel I wasted my life or lived with regrets, and spending all my energy and time working hard in a job that isn't rewarding (not resources or property type rewards) is a life wasted and full of regrets.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: What I learned from quiet quitting for 2 years across different companies. Note - always evaluate your risk profile, goals and skills before quiet quitting.\nNote 2 - Quiet quitting means you deliver on the minimum expectations of the job without going above and beyond.\nI‚Äôve (25yo) got about 4 yoe. 2 of which I have quiet quitted. This is what my experience was -\nSince I had taken a step back and delivered just the bare minimum, I was basically working 2-3 productive hours a day and additionally attending any meetings.\nI realised I can bullshit and cruise at work for a very very long time before it caught up to me. Companies actually seem to have a very high tolerance to bullshitters.\nAn alternative name for bullshitting is ‚Äúcreating visibility‚Äù. So many a times, I basically created a lot of visibility about things that dont matter, and cruised for months pretending about solving them. This was over and above the bare minimum requirements though\nOr I gave 10X the quote for the time required to do something. Now, I would caveat it by saying, I am pretty good at my job. Better than the people who ask for timelines. So all I needed to do was package stuff in a manner for the timelines to be plausible, or add fluff work to pad the timelines.\nWhat I understood is that almost everyone is in this bullshitting game at work. Some do it to further their career, others do it to slack off at work. And those who do honest work end up getting burdened with a crazy amount of work.\nGiven the layoffs and companies showing their true colours wrt how loyal employees are treated, it doesn‚Äôt really make any sense to be that honest guy doing everyone else‚Äôs work.\nBottom line is there wasn‚Äôt much difference between how my career progressed when I was working my ass off vs while I had quiet quit. It‚Äôs just that, to get a promotion, I am having to switch companies.\nTook me 4 years to go from software dev to senior software dev. I don‚Äôt really mind that since my income has always been decent even as a software dev. The pay per hour of work though‚Ä¶ absolutely insane when you‚Äôre working 8-10 hours a week üòÇ\nIf anyone‚Äôs experiencing burnout, and toying with the idea of quiet quitting, I feel there‚Äôs a few checkboxes to tick before you take the step.\nEmergency fund of 1 year. This is a must.\nYou should be very good at your job\nYou should be comfortable switching companies as often as every 1-2 years.\nKnow that your career will have a shorter shelf life. So maintain a very high savings rate.\nYou shouldn‚Äôt have any dependents.\nI believe there‚Äôs a lot more to life than working over the bare minimum requirements of a job. I get paid for the minimum requirements, and not for the additional stuff. So why do the charity. Companies aint going above and beyond for me when I ask for a pay hike in accordance to work delivered that was well over expectations.\nI was doing it both while in WFO and WFH. Go to office, eat, chill and play video games, lol. I feel I work a lot more hours when WFH.\nAgain, quiet quitting doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt do anything. The bare minimum is a must. If I have to build a whole service myself as a bare minimum, then I will do it and have been the owner of sizeable services in my exp. it‚Äôs just that if it takes an average person 6 months, and I could do it in 2 months, then I would quote 6 months with a scoped down version, and another 3 months to flush it out with all the bells and whistles', a user said: 'Been on this post for the past hour now, I relate to this very much (except with the huge numbers OP has mentioned XD ) I'm (24M) close to completing 3 years (switched to prod base after 2 years from Deloitte) in my career as an SDE, I'm also planning on upskilling to get into the AI specifically GenAi which would secure a spot for me in this unstable market. I can see myself making a similar post if I was in OPs place rn, and I've had similar discussions with my peers as well. I've been in this \"quiet quitting\" phase, ever since I started my career with zero experience in the field until I got my first job. I had a tough time initially when I started in both firms but once I got the hang of it things went pretty smoothly without doing the \"hard work\" except a few late nighters and weekends, and I got rewarded and appreciated for my work several times. But I feel saturated with the kind work being done over time. The architecture and the technology feels familiar the work gets repeated over and over again so I usually wrap up any stories or tasks assigned to me within the deadline or even sooner. I could spend the remaining time helping the juniors or take the load off senior dev by assisting them, but I avoid doing so cuz one thing is I'm not getting paid to do their job and second I'd still be doing the same kinda work which I already did. So I've decided to spend the remaining time I have to work on my own thing, upskill to a level that is in sync with the market and at the same time having enough knowledge to be self reliant. Sorry bout the long passage, but OP can we discuss more on your career journey over DM ? Or Continuing with the thread? Any intel would be appreciated, thanks! üôåüèΩ'"
