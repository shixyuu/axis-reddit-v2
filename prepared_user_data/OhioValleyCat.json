        "In response to 'Original Post: How to effectively quiet quit as the highest performer on my team I am the team's highest performer. I have a lead IC role (\"hybrid management\") where a lot of my job duties involve coaching, development plans and employee growth. I am one of two lead ICs and there are like 3-4 other ICs on the team.\nOver the past two years, I've taken this position very seriously and have operated at a much higher level (the position above mine) than expected. I was rapidly promoted to lead IC in less than a year and I have been told that going into full management is \"mine if I want it\". The difference between myself and the other ICs on the team (including lead IC) is pretty dramatic. I'm easily doing twice or three times the workload and have a much higher operational proficiency, client satisfaction, etc.\nFor a plethora of reasons, I've become totally disillusioned with the institution, middle/upper management, and the position. What's compounding my anger/depression is that I took my position as a downgrade in my career, but intended to be underpaid and underappreciated for 2-ish years to build up hands-on experience in a new industry. I've been ACTIVELY trying to get OUT and make a lateral or upwards move (externally, not internally as my institution does not offer internal jobs) and because of the PARTICULARLY shitty state of the white-collar job market (\"worse than 2008\"), I have been faced with rejection after rejection after rejection, usually after getting 99% of the way there. I also have particular grievances about the way that middle/upper management has \"strung me along\" on a variety of promises. I look back and see that I'm literally ROTTING in what was supposed to be a temporary position, in the prime years of my career, and I feel STUCK (can't get out no matter how hard I try).\nIt's important to note that I really don't *like* the idea of quiet-quitting. I always used to say \"why would you quiet quit? Just go find a better job that you feel fulfilled in\". The problem now is that I'm so bitter at the institution that putting in extra effort feels nauseating and violating, and I'm STUCK at this job due to the extremely terrible job market (unless I restart my career entirely or quit without a job lined up).\nAnyways, circling back to the point of my question: I've become widely known as such an aggressive overperformer that my bosses have flat-out told me that overperformance has become my new baseline for expected monthly performance. I used to easily get \"exceeds expectations\" every month, whereas now they want me to continuously struggle and squeeze every drop of effort out of myself just to justify a \"meets expectations\". My goal for quiet quitting is to start putting in the same amount of effort as the other lead IC, who notoriously underperforms but is never held accountable. However, it's going to become extremely and immediately apparent as soon as my next monthly performance evaluation hits, and my managers are going to be asking me \"WTF is going on\".\nI fear that this will immediately result in 1-2 months of \"does not meet expectations\", followed swiftly by a PIP or something like that. I'll be told to go back to my previous baseline, and when I don't, I'll be accused of insubordination or something. I really don't want to deal with this level of mental stress, especially as I'm already highly depressed from my rejections while job-searching.\nDo any managers here have an idea of what I should do to effectively and smartly go from \"ultra top performer\" to quiet-quitter?', a user said: 'I was a high performer in my previous job.  I always continued working hard and making an effort to produce quality work.   However, when I decided that it was my time to leave, my quiet quitting as a high performer included not volunteering to help on projects I was not assigned to, leaving work at a decent hour, etc.  My impetus for leaving my old job was poor work-life balance which was also damaging my health.\nWith your bosses having told you that overperformance is the new baseline for meeting expectations,  it is almost like a target has been placed on you.   Being at the point of disillusionment is not an ideal work setting, so you should put more energy towards leaving. When I decided to leave, my second job became looking for a new job.   Every day after work, I came home and did at least 1-2 hours of new job search-related activities and then on the weekend, I would put in at least 2-3 hours each day going through job listings and preparing resumes, cover letters, and applications.  I would strongly recommend focusing on getting out of there into a better situation.   The job market isn't the greatest, but there are still opportunities out there for people with experience, education, and training.'"
