        "In response to 'Original Post: MacDonald: 'Quiet quitting'? No, it's just work-to-rule â€” and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'I agree with the first part, I am not a supervisor for that reason and I have discussed just that with my employer. I am what you would call a person of influence. I am an expert, but I don't wear the title and it limits my compensation. But people can't \"quiet quit\" and wonder why they are still in the same position they were in when they started. Or cry because they are not making any more money. It's about building your skillset and being marketable. If your employer doesn't see your value, someone else will. It is also up to you to know your worth.'"
