        "In response to 'Original Post: Gail Simone quietly quit comics four years ago, until Marvel offered her Uncanny X-Men relaunch for 2024 [External Link]: https://www.thepopverse.com/gail-simone-quit-comics-uncanny-xmen-x-men-wondercon-2024', a user said: 'The reporter here got this wrong. I didn't 'quit comics,' quietly or otherwise.  For years, I'd been asked about working on games and novels and other stuff, and I turned it down mostly, because I wanted to keep doing comics.   One day I decided, hey, I should try this other stuff, just to see if I like it. Almost all the projects were still comics-related, they just weren't comics.  And I still made comics, it's 100% that all the outside projects grew in scope and left me with very little time.  I still wanted to make comics, and I couldn't wait until some of those outside things ended so I could get back to it.\nNever 'quit' comics, just tried some other stuff without realizing how much of a time suck they would be!  :)'",

It seems like it would be...stressful? :)'",
