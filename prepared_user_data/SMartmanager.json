        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is just another way for employers to make you feel like shit for not happily going above and beyond because you think youâ€™re supposed to. Just last week my boss told one of my other coworkers that I make my own hours and I said yeah eight hours a day five days a week you got a problem with that you can replace me. He shut the fuck up after that.'"
