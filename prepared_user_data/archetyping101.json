        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'But isn't that just Robyn? Low effort sister wife. Low effort business owner (mswc). Low effort parenting (thus Mykelti and covid nanny).'",
        "In response to 'True but she has even less input and looks as enthusiastic as I do turning up to work in the last week of my employment before quitting.', a user said: 'Probably not having the other wives $$$ is really depressing for her ðŸ¤£'"
