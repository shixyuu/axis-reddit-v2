        "In response to 'My friend who’s PIMR (relaxed), was crying the other day about they don’t enjoy being around witnesses anymore. They felt bad about the fact that they don’t enjoy meetings, memorial, assembly.\nThey know that I’m PIMO, about to be POMO. They do just about everything that I do even though they still believe. Maybe it will catch on to them that they’re wasting their life in the org. It’s clear being in the hamster wheel is not doing them any good, but they just need “something to believe in”.', a user said: 'Sounds like your friend is PRMI'"
