        "In response to 'Original Post: I for one am grateful for APDs quiet quitting bc my vehicle tags are 3 years expired with no plans for renewal on the horizon. Living dangerously over here.', a user said: 'I went 6 years without renewing mine. Didn't do it until I got a ticket in small town East Texas. Even renewing it, I expected to basically backpay every year I hadn't paid, I was fully prepared to do it. But I only paid a $50 fine. So it did not incentivize to renew on time.\nAnd before anyone asks, yes I was insured the whole time.'"
