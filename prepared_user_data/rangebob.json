He was so mad when he got an op 24. Didn't know what else he could have done to get a 25'",
        "In response to 'Kind stranger pray tell what is op 24?', a user said: 'its the grade you get at the end of school in QLD before they changed to ATAR. 1 was the best,  25 the worst\nhe was furious he didn't get a 25 lol'",
        "In response to 'I had a friend in high school in a similar situation. worse than the lowest mark was something called ‘non serious attempt’. He wrote an essay that was meant to be from the perspective of the director of the movie they were writing about and he ended it with something along the lines of ‘the red blood splattered on the white wall because it was the closest wall, any English teacher who says otherwise is reading too much into it’ and he was told his essay was ‘bordering not serious attempt’. He was like ‘bordering! What more can I do’', a user said: 'hahaha yes.....just like my old mate Josh\nI wonder where he is now.'"
