        "In response to 'Yeah I’m being heavily gaslighted… and he has stopped for now because we have cameras and I said okay let’s watch the camera so we can see who’s the one doing 99% of all the cleaning in the house.', a user said: 'Didn't camera - but\ndid\nbreak up with a few year boyfriend in my early 30's because he was insistent that I needed to CLEAN HIS HOUSE even though I owned my own house and needed to keep that clean, what the fuck.\nSo I broke up with him. And then about five years later I realized he had photographs that we had taken on film and asked him if I could come get copies because they were of myself and my child and he said sure!\nLadies. I walked into this house that I broke up with him over to retrieve the photos, an overall pleasant transaction. And he had the exact same piles of shit on top of his shit from the day I broke up with him. Maddening if it weren't so ridiculous'",
        "In response to 'My abusive ex doubled down and tried to propose 4 months before I finally left him lol. I don’t know on what planet someone realizes their partner is checked out and thinks that a flashy ring will somehow fix the problems that lead to them wanting to leave in the first place. Solid logic.', a user said: 'After I broke up with douche canoe mentioned a couple comments above - he not only proposed, but he proposed with a custom-made ring that a friend who owned a jewelry shop made – and I told him to get the fuck off my property, lol. He wouldn't leave. Just would not fucking leave and I wouldn't let him in the house and he followed me around in my yard and I finally had to tell him I was gonna call the cops because what the actual fuck. A Ring was not gonna change my mind'"
