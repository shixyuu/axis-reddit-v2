If a coach is in cfb for 5 years, they have about 60 games of data. If they just happen to get a few good players due to whatever reason, whether its hype or just kids wanting to play for a certain school, a bad coach can get a lot of wins with an otherwise mediocre team. I imagine it's pretty hard to tease apart those variables.'"
