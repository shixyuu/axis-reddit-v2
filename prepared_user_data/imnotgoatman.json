        "In response to 'Original Post: When you quiet quit/ride it out till you get fired, it negatively affects others in this community I had a teammate who had been dropping the ball for a while and was finally let go this week. His output was so bad that my manager noticed and did some digging. Turns out he barely worked at all and was clearly just coasting till he got fired.\nWell, my manager and skip are PISSED and literally called out how they think our old teammate was working multiple jobs. In my xp, they definitely were as they had many signs.\nRegardless, it’s now coming back to bite my team and me with new policies. Yes I’m pushing back on all the BS coming our way and trying to minimize it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if activity monitoring software came up soon to flag suspicious activity as well. This gig has been great for OE for years and now it’s in jeopardy because someone couldn’t just quit when they were done… I have friends (OE and not) at multiple other companies who are dealing with fallout like this as well.\nMy point being, when you pull the anti work card and coast like this just waiting to be fired (which I see recommended here daily), it’s not an isolated event. You get your bag a bit bigger and your teammates (and fellow OEers) deal with the fallout.\nIt helps to push for more RTOs that may have not as it eliminates the possibility of many of these issues. This also affects remote offerings (wayyyy down from what I’m seeing myself in new job hunts)\nHow would you feel if others put your extra paycheck(s) in jeopardy?\nGet your bag, but don’t screw others over while you do it.', a user said: 'Companies just need an excuse to come up with this bullshit. What if he wasn't actually OEing but was overwhelmed, burnt out, whatever? You never know. You are assuming.\nFuck companies. Let them waste their money on this bullshit monitoring that will not work and will only hinder their employee's performance and happiness in their work.'",
        "In response to 'Not assuming in this case, he slipped up multiple times', a user said: 'Do you have proof? It's pretty well known that we in this community think everyone else is OEing just because we are.\nBut either way, regardless of weather this particular person was OE or not, the same thing still applies: companies will implement anti-OE measures because they are assholes and don't want to improve their processes. They don't want to improve management, they don't want to improve KPIs and reporting, they don't want to invest time in actually figuring out if people are properly doing their jobs or not. They want easy fixes, like blaming OE and implementing these bullshit monitoring tools.\nWell, jokes on them, these bullshit monitoring tools harm their workers, their productivity and in the end the company itself. While people will continue OEing no problem.\nNow I'm not saying you are wrong or anything, I'm just trying to propose a different perspective. We should be anti-work. Corporations are evil. Put the blame on the company, never on the worker. Don't go against your equals. That's what they want you to do so they can continue to exploit you.'"
