Think I’m going cheapest this year, can’t go anyway.', a user said: 'My premiums are good, 330 a month for family of 4. It’s premium anthem blue cross. My employers total cost is 55 Million per year for a company with 3700 employees. They actually eat a lot of the cost. It costs me 4200 a year to insure my family and it costs my employer 13,000.\nI’m moving to a new employer soon and the same package there is 12,800. Guess where they move the cost to in that company…the employee! Needless to say though, why the fuck does it cost 17000 a year to insure a family and you still have deductible and out of pocket expenses so it could cost you 22-25K. That’s the price of a mortgage per year (edit for clarity).'",
