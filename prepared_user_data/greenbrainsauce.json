        "In response to 'Original Post: [The Philippine Star] \"Quiet quitting\" is taking over the workplace â€“ what exactly does it mean? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'As a manager,\nquiet quitting\nshould be the default kung wala kang pang-promote sa employado. If you expect the employee to step-up, then there better be a damn incentive at the end of that huge leap.\nKaya bawal ang OT sa team unless urgent. Kahit initiative nila mag-OT, hindi pa din dapat dahil they should enjoy life outside of work.'"
