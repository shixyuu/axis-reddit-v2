[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'I work in the HR department and I truly believe quiet quitting is bs. The very definition says that it is \"an application of work-to-rule, in which employees work within defined work hours and engage in work-related activities solely within those hours\". So basically working the hours you agreed to for the pay you also agreed to? This is not quitting in my book. If you want me to work more or go beyond, I'm gonna need it stated on a contract with a corresponding reward system.'"
