        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: ''Quiet quitting' is just doing what you're paid to do. Such a stupid term. It's what everyone should be doing, and if employers want us to take on extra tasks, they should offer a pay rise and, if appropriate, a promotion.\nIn April several of my friends' companies had 2 or more people quit, transfer or retire, and the companies decided not to replace them, instead asking everyone else to do more work, with no pay increase. Screw that crap.\nEmployers need a reality check and to start paying people wages that keep up with the cost of living.'"
