[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'Anecdotal Example:\nWorking according to your contract is me, at my current job, taking a few more than necessary 15-20 minute breaks to relax my brain or work on some personal stuff, then getting back to my work and finishing it all in a timely manner.\nQuiet Quitting is me, at my old job, doing all the work assigned to me in 30 minutes in the morning, then going back to my work station and reading books/watching YouTube for the rest of the day since my boss was a schmuck and didn't listen to me when I told him I made a program that can do all my work in 30 minutes and not take 3 days like the guy before me.'"
