        "In response to 'Original Post: Where Are the Workers? From Great Resignation to Quiet Quitting [External Link]: https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2023/09/27/where-are-the-workers-from-great-resignation-to-quiet-quitting', a user said: 'I feel there’s two distinct behaviors that are interchangeably being dubbed “quiet quitting”.\nQuiet quitting is no longer adhering to the “above and beyond” job description. Doing what is in the scope of your role and not boot licking or trying to impress with more hours, more productivity. Basically, not trying to get ahead or promoted but still meeting the requirements of the position. And boomers grumble at work ethic but really it’s a better work life balance.\nQuiet quitting is actually intentionally failing to meet requirements of your job. Underperforming or refusing to meet expectations and therefore drawing out the termination process instead of just resigning, with the purpose of “sticking it to the company” and collecting a couple extra weeks/months pay. As in, quitting but not really sharing your intentions.\nI believe that quiet quitting SHOULD be defined as description #2. In fact until about 6-12 months ago, I think it was used this way.\nHowever, most recent blurbs where “quiet quitting” is used seem to describe “lazy workers” instead. I feel the term is just a strange negative-seeming description of a positive behavior: worker empowerment and priorities shifting in Millennial and Gen-Z workforce.'"
