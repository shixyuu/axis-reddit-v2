        "In response to 'Yup. We thought so, too, but when you have a company that is half union, half non-union, you get some really crazy policies that can easily be abused.', a user said: 'There was a dude in my company that did this. He cleverly timed several several events in a row: first rotator cuff surgery 6months recovery, then he immediately had the other shoulder for another 6 months, then family maternity leave cuz his wife had a baby, the moment that leave was up he had some other medical procedure (I forgot the detail) bringing the total time up to almost 2 years.\nWhen he did came back, he was very behind in terms of technology, procedures, had to get re-certified on a bunch of things, new contract rules, etc. A few things he had been grandfathered into but now had to actually learn and get pass certifications for.\nHe struggled a bit to do his job and got angry/jealous/threatened by the person who had subbing for him this whole time.\nWhile legally his job was there for him to come back to, it was more obviously than daylight the person subbing was more than qualified and proven they could do the job beyond well. AND had developed excellent rapport with clients and staff alike.\n(The original was a bit of a creep towards women and verbally hostile towards LBGT+ people. policy & culture on that had significant changes during the time he was out. The old boys club was no longer able to cover nor foster that behavior with him.)\nThe result: well...because legally- heâ€™s still there in his old position, he just hides out somewhere for most of the time, collecting his paycheck.\nSubstitute person has stayed on, company has finagled a way to create a path for retaining this person.'"
