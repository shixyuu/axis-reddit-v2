Conditions for many are still outrageously ghastly. And it still, in my opinion / observation , matters to almost no one. Or is even noticed. The ‘excuses’ are legion, we all know, & have heard them ad nauseum.  Just yesterday I watched, horrified, a clearly overwhelmed, miserable counter-staffer at a ‘service area’ ON HER OWN facing a proverbial Golden Week H O R D E of needy, pushy, often fed-up & cranky customers pouring forth by the thousands to order cheap cigarettes, crap ‘ramen’, & so forth.'"
