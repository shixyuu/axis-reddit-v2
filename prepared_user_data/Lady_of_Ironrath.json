        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'This is a pretty normal and healthy working ethic. Why would you do otherwise? People who over work and are very productive (i.e. finish stuff earlier than colleagues) don't get rewarded. They get punished by getting more work load.\nI used to be an over achiever and trust me, it leads nowhere. This mentality does you no favour. Don't be a slave by choice. Nobody appreciates it and it makes you miserable.'"
