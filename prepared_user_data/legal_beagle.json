        "In response to 'Yeah, the grief is rough, and sometimes hard to identify, because logically, it doesn't\nseem\nlike you should be grieving, right?\nYou're getting out! You're escaping a bad situation! You're moving towards a better future!\nAnd like, yes, all of that is true, but you're still grieving the marriage and future that you\nthought\nyou had. The constant safe thing in your life has died.', a user said: 'This is exactly it. I’m going through the divorce process now and getting out of an abusive marriage, and even though I KNOW this is what’s best for me, I’m still so sad over the life I thought I would have and the future I’m losing.\nI remind myself that the life I thought I had/wanted to have is not actually the life I was living. Sometimes that helps.'"
