        "In response to 'that's not quiet quitting, that's essentially fraudulent behaviour (you are intentionally undertaking wrongful behaviour for financial gain). The fact that you're doing it for an employer and not a paying customer or client does not give flexibility on the actions being performed.\nThat's exactly why it's quiet\nquitting\n- because you aren't working, you are doing something else.\nBTW, I'd say I am pretty\nacademically inclined\nand I'm not adopting terminology based on industrial action to describe doing your job as agreed, and using both in place of quiet quitting - an act of microagression towards an employer arising from a lack of motivation or interest.\nIn an office environment, quiet quitting is doing things like:\n- organising/attending excessive meetings to avoid doing work\n- away from desk/ prioritising duties non-essential to your role\n- otherwise fucking around outside of designated agreed break times instead of doing the work required, but in a way that you can\njustify\nQuiet quitters will tend to do the work they\nwant to do\nand not the work they don't want to. As I said, it's a motivational issue, and if you are quiet quitting correctly, you'll be a pain in the butt, but an employable one for the most part.', a user said: 'I mean, you're wrong, though.\nu/pryza91\ndid you a solid by being bang on in their definition/s. It's kind of up to you if you want to be willfully ignorant about it at this point, but you do you I guess.\nSource: am literally being paid to research quiet quitting. Academically, as it were.'"
