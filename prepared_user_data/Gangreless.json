I don’t dread going into work.\nThis has been the best job of my life and not because I am happy and fulfilled, but because there is zero stress.', a user said: 'This has been my husband since March 2020. In a senior level IT position, usually works an hour or so a day, some days has meetings so that take sup more time. Occasionally he's busier than usual but still nothing like it would be in the office. Best part is we had a kid in Oct and he hasn't had to miss anything. He gets to hang out with him during the day, goes to every doctor visit, I can sleep in a bit if his morning is slow, it's glorious.'"
