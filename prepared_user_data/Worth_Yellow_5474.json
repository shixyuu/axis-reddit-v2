        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'This happened to me, but as a Grad Student. They wanted me to work my departed PI position in the lab but for a tuition waiver and no additional money while writing grants to fund myself. I told them I would think about it and went to the private sector instead. I was already mentally done at that point. After having two PI quit and leave, it was obvious to me what was going on. I also got a speech about \"being a team player\" and  \"our vision of the department\" that I heard in the private sector before going to grad school.'"
