        "In response to 'I did for a while earlier this year, I was a really hard worker at my company about a year ago and would always exceed my kpis. In January I found out I was going to be made redundant through my manager so I slowed down my pace with work to focus on my mental health and looking for other roles. On the 3 days from home where I wasn't in the office I would log on at like 10am, answer a few things then log off until 4pm when I would respond to some emails before clocking off and repeat. I wouldn't recommend this as I had clients and internal coworkers getting pretty pissed, however I was told I couldn't tell my coworkers about the redundancy.\nMentally I really didn't have the energy to be fucked working for a place that was letting me go. However, 3-4 months passed and the redundancy didn't happen since they realized they needed me, right after I found that out I ended up quitting. Luckily I just accepted a new role at what seems to be a better company.', a user said: 'How much in redundancy did you miss?\nDid the manager accidentally tell you about the redundancy or were they a mate?\nI know someone in a similar situation t this who was warned and I wasn’t'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I’m still a bit surprised my manager didn’t warn me at all. I’m assuming there are HR reasons, but I would have understood.\nDid he specifically set out to warn you or did you coax it out of him or it was an accident?'"
