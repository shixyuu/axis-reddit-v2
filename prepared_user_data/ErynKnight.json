        "In response to 'Someone trying to put a label on something so others can rage on it. Quiet Quitting is just a term business use as the younger generations are finally wise to the fact that they should be paid for going above and beyond and not just a pat on the back. Business are losing free labour and using terms such as wage theft, quiet Quitting to try and get older generations to go 'back in my day'. The old dynamics are not working so they are trying to bring them back through anger.', a user said: 'Minimum wage gets minimum effort. Employers are\nshocked\nby this one thing.'",
        "In response to 'Minimum wage is the biggest slap in the face ever.  It's basically your employer saying to you \"I'd pay you less if I could.\"', a user said: 'Yep. It really is. And they wonder why no one wants to work there...'",
        "In response to 'Yeah it's crazy. My friend's daughter is 17 and has a level 2 childcare qualification. She works in a local day nursery and gets paid £4.81 an hour. She's a lot better at that kind of job than I'd ever be yet I'd earn £9.50 per hour for the same job. It isn't fair. The minimum wage should apply to everyone over 16 at the same rate and then higher pay should be based on qualifications and experience.', a user said: 'It's the only discrimination they're allowed to get away with. IMO, younger = freshest, most up-to-date knowledge. Sure it lacks experience, but I think what it lacks there, it more than makes up for in the up-to-date knowledge.\nIf it were the other way round and the minimum wage for over 60s was £4, there'd be hell to pay.'"
