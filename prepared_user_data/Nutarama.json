        "In response to 'Domestic manufacturing is more of a national security issue than it is a jobs issue. The US doesn’t really need manufacturing jobs to keep people employed, it just needs to be able to make stuff.', a user said: 'Yeah and it’s not even the stuff necessarily, it’s the skilled labor to make the stuff. It’s easier to train someone to be a soldier than to train someone to make missiles or planes or tanks.  Soviet Union in WW2 had huge quality issues because they were taking farmers and making them welders and relying solely on on-the-job training.  Even now Raytheon is facing issues because the demand for Patriot missiles is really high, and it’ll be easier to get the machines to build them than it will be to get aerospace-grade machinists and fabricators.'"
