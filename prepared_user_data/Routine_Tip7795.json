        "In response to 'Original Post: I’m quiet quitting my PhD I’m over stressing about it. None of this matters anyway. My experiment failed? It’s on my advisor to think about what I can do to still get this degree. I’m done overachieving and stressing literally ruining my health over this stupid degree that doesn’t matter anyway. Fuck it and fuck academia! I want to do something that makes me happy in the future and it’s clear academia is NOT IT!\nEdit: wow this post popped off. And I feel the need to address some things.\n1. I am not going to sit back and do nothing for the rest of my PhD. I’m going to do the reasonable minimum amount of work necessary to finish my dissertation and no more. Others in my lab are not applying for as many grants or extracurricular positions as I am, and I’m tired of trying to go the extra mile to “look good”. It’s too much.\n2. Some of yall don’t understand what a failed fieldwork experiment looks like. A ton of physical work, far away from home and everyone you know for months, and at the end of the day you get no data. No data cannot be published. And then if you want to try repeating it you need to wait another YEAR for the next season.\n3. Yes I do have some mental and physical health issues that have been exacerbated by doing this PhD, which is why I want to finish it and never look back. I am absolutely burnt out.', a user said: 'If academia makes you unhappy, you should leave. Nothing is worth pursuing if it doesn’t make you happy.\nIf quitting your PhD is what it comes down to, no shame there. You gave it your best and it didn’t work out. Many have quit before you and gone on to have amazingly successful careers, many will quit after you and go on to be amazingly successful.\nOverachieving and stressing isn’t good.  Don’t do that. Stressing to overachieve may be ok, but stressing after overachieving isn’t good. If you are convinced you have overachieved, don’t stress.\nLastly, and this you may not like, when you say “it’s on your advisor to figure out how to get you the degree”, why is it on him? Think I may have misunderstood your post, but why would he care to figure out how to get you a degree you have decided to quit from? Maybe “quiet quitting” means something that’s relevant here, but I don’t know what that is so it might be my lack of understanding.'"
