        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It’s a ridiculous phrase.\nI suppose I’m a quiet quitter. All that means is that I finish on time, don’t volunteer for stuff I don’t want to do, and I’m not always available.\nIf it’s the working week and I have nothing to do, I’m not seeking out extra. I’m spending that time productively on my own hobbies and interests. I’m damn good at my job, but it’s not my life and I’d rather not work as much as possible'"
