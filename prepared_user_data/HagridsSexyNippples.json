        "In response to 'As someone who used to bust my ass and bend over backwards I stopped. Because I was laid off permanently while all the new guys got to keep their jobs because they were “cheaper” and all the promotions I’ve worked my ass off for were all given to outside hires with no experience. So now I look at as “why bother trying?” There’s literally no incentive to try. Raises aren’t different for people who work harder anymore. It’s all based on how long your with the company.', a user said: 'I agree. I also feel like some jobs keep people in position where they are needed instead of letting them get promoted. Another thing is that I’ve always worked in places with high turnover. I’ve noticed that if you seem to care about losing your job and keeping them happy, they will walk all over you. They think they can treat people how they want and you’re not going anywhere. If you don’t bend over backwards for them, they will do a lot more to accommodate you.'"
