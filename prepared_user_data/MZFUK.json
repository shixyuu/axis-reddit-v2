The same companies offer no genuine praise or incentive for your efforts.\nCompanies think grinding you down is the optimal way to produce results. Imagine if they built an environment that you wanted to work in, that you were happy about going into every day.\nCan you imagine how much more receptive and hard-working people get when they feel valued, supported, and happy at work? It's almost as if treating people better makes for better results—a mind-blowing concept.'"
