Open your own account and start putting your money there. Tell people. I did 27 years of shouldering 100% of the physical work load in the home, kids, and finances. He did pay a few bills, he depended on me to fix everything, especially the finances as I became his mommy. My mistakes is I told no one. Donâ€™t do that. Tell everyone. Get out ASAP. That was my other mistake. I stayed too long. Good luck OP!'"
