        "In response to 'I'm from the UK so I'm not sure how it works in the US but how does someone get $100k in debt from student loans? Quick google showed the average course for a state college is $10k for a US resident and a private college was about $35k, and thats for the fully course not per year.\nI'm asking because in the UK out student works like this, when you apply for a higher education course so college or uni you're allowed up to 4 years of tuition from the government, It basically gives you a cap so you can never get into that sheer amount of debt. And once you start earning I think its £25k a year you then have X amount taken out of your pay basically like an extra tax.', a user said: 'How it works is like this:\nEach college has a fee per credit and you need a certain amount of credits to graduate. They kind of average this out per year. If I went back to my college now, it would be $59,000 each year, but tuition usually increases every year, so probably 59,000; 60,000; 61,000, 62,000. These are all paid as loans from the federal government or private company. My loans are sitting at a pretty 7.2% and 6.9% interest rate.\nSo, right out of college, a grad from my school would owe about 240,000. Now, most colleges give scholarships. Let’s say the grad gets half off every year. So the grad has 120,000 of debt straight out of college. Not many new grads can pay this out of college. It comes out to like 1600/month in payments.\nSo, the grad goes on an income driven repayment plan. The issue with these plans is that your monthly payment doesn’t even cover interest. So each of those loans accrue interest on top of interest.\nCompound that for 20-25 years and you can see where people are in mountains of debt.'"
