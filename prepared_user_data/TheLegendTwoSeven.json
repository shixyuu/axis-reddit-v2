        "In response to 'I don’t know in the US but in Ontario Canada even salaried workers are entitled to overtime. You calculated it based on a 44hr work week and the excess gets time and a half. I’ve never met ANYONE who’s taken the OT. They just laugh at me. I’d like to see that change. It NEEDS to change', a user said: 'In the US, salaried workers are not eligible for overtime. You get paid the same no matter how many hours you work.'",
        "In response to 'It reminds me of the story of the welder who replies to an ad offering $16-30/hr. He does one good enough, but ultimately shitty weld, then does a beautiful weld that shows his skill and craftsmanship. Then tells the interviewers: the first is what you’ll get from me for $16, the second is $30.\nThis is the reaction of millions of people being taught that raises/promotion requires that extra effort, just for the company to hire from outside instead of promoting within. I will do what I am required and nothing else, unless it benefits a friend/coworker (maybe taking a shorter lunch here and there to help them button up a project). If you want more, I will need to be compensated for more.', a user said: 'Potential Employer: Alright, can you do a shittier weld and I’ll pay you $12/hr?'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'It’s a business owner term I think. If you’re used to getting 60,000 hours of work per month and it drops to 40,000 because people are only working 40 hours per week instead of 60,000, it makes them feel butthurt because they’re getting less free labor that they feel entitled to.'"
