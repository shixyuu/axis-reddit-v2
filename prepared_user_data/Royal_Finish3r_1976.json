[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'There's so much shit happening around us that I don't blame them for doing that. There's still a pandemic going on, every single purchasable goods have increased prices , children and teenagers are not safe from both Abductors and Policemen alike, The government's priorities are all over the place, focusing on shallow or petty ideas like the ABS - TV5 Merger or extinguishing everything that they perceive as anti-government, and to top it all off, the guy who's supposed to try and help his fellow citizens has done what everyone was expecting him to do. HE'S F*CKING PARTYING!!!. Everyone's tired with our current situation and there's nothing that will help ease this feeling of melancholy and unease.'"
