They would lose a major revenue stream', a user said: 'There is no international \"big pharma\" conglomerate. They're rival companies who want to beat each other for new cures and new treatments so they can get the sole patents and make serious bank.\nCancer is also an umbrella term for out-of-control growth of cells without apoptosis (cell death). As such, there will never be one singular cure for all of it. Each type of cancer will need its own. Much like how our vaccines are for each virus and there isn't just one universal vaccine for all viruses.'"
