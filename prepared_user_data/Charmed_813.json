        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'Hi - business manager for a STEM dept for an R-1 land grant in the Midwest.\nI have had to lay off more amazing scientists and researchers in the last few months than I care to count.\nNO!!! Protect your peace. Collect your check. Get out.\nI’m working half as hard and currently working to get to a blue state that fully supports Higher Ed as well.\nIt sucks here right now. And by here I mean America, in higher ed under the Trump regime.\nI’m so sorry this has happened to you. It isn’t fair. It isn’t about you or the research. It is about funding tax cuts for billionaires and breaking the federal government so that one political party can point to government and say “see government is broken, let’s sell it off for parts and privatize it all.”'"
