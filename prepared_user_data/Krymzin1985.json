Its like a traumatized inherited skill exploited to hell.', a user said: 'Facts. Honestly after 3 years I'm thinking about quitting for real. I work way to hard while the others in the same position as me aren't held to the same standard bc they are young and I'm not so more is expected of me.'",
        "In response to 'Doesn't have to do with age at all. Learning how to get away with the rules and do bare minimum to last a snailathon is what is at mind. It isn't quiet quiting anything if you show up and are on the clocks but management would rather make you do the work then someone that knows how to cause a problems in the managers office.', a user said: 'At my FC I was told to my face WE expect more out of you. Your this age and the other PAs are only 22 and 23. So I would say it kinda does. Plus the above comment said older ppl tend to work harder anyway bc it was ingrained in us from childhood. That's also what I was agreeing with. I had a job at 12, and was helping my parents out financially. And no it wasn't babysitting. I started doing that when I was 8. This was a legit job at a mom n pop shop'"
