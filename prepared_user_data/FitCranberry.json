        "In response to 'As 100% of my uni friends (we graduated 4-5 years ago) like to lecture me (throughout the past 7-8 years), hustle now, relax later. If you don't chiong while you're young, you're wasting your time.\nThese are the same friends who on top of studying full time (back in uni), held a part time/weekend job. Now they're working 60+ hour weeks while trying to invest on the side. And it's not like they really need money but rather \"more money is always better\".\nTheir logic is simple, trying to trade a low quality of life NOW for a higher quality of life in the FUTURE.\nSo yeah, apparently \"money\" is the cake that is more precious than time.\nSide Note: These \"friends\" all come from low-middle to high-middle income families (me included) so I don't presume to speak for anyone else.', a user said: 'ah yes, we need these types to grease the cogs and feed the machine. the less they know about standards elsewhere, the better we can isolate them in that culture'"
