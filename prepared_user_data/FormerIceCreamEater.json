        "In response to 'I'll never understand how there are so many bad coaches, or hell bad QBs in the NFL', a user said: 'How do you define a bad coach?  Because obviously there are going to be coaches that lose games; just the nature of the beast.  If losing coaches are bad, then it shouldn't surprise you.  Every team obviously can't go 12-0 or even 9-3.'",
        "In response to 'Get the big buyout. Go coach another program for $4 million a year without the crazy expectations. Work smarter not harder.', a user said: 'How much are A&M boosters really willing to fork out?  I can't see them paying 90 million to fire him.  That is just insane.  Also even with their mediocrity this year, he did have the top recruiting class in the country he can sell hope with.  You gotta let those players at least be in the program a few years before you totally write him off.'",
        "In response to 'Better than loudly quitting like Venables', a user said: 'Venables is just a prime example of a guy who is a great coordinator, but doesn't have what it takes to be the Captain of the Ship.  Norm Chow was the same way; legendary OC, but when he became an OC he was historically awful.\nBud Foster is another that is an interesting case.  He never became a Head Coach even though I'm sure he had some opportunities.  He was a great DC, but probably knew he didn't have what it takes to be the HC and stayed in his lane.'"
