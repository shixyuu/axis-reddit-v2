        "In response to 'Gotta be more boomer propaganda. Pay has always been the only thing that matters.\nOnce good pay is achieved, the other things come into play, but not a second before.', a user said: 'Precisely. Perqs are all nice to have, and they can help with employee retention. But they don’t matter if the pay isn’t sufficient or competitive. The most important thing to every employee is “I need to be able to pay my bills”. The next thing is “I want to have money to do enjoyable things”. After that, the work culture starts to come into play.\nI’ve just had a couple of people leaving my team, because someone offered them double what I was paying. (Their new positions are significant promotions for them.) I can’t match that. What they’re doing now is not at the level to pay double. All I can do is congratulate them on the new job.'"
