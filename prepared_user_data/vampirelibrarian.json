        "In response to 'Quiet quitting wasnâ€™t a movement, it was a description of a thing that was happening. And that thing was burnout.', a user said: '\"quiet quitting\" was never even about burnout, suddenly doing less, or refusing to do a job. Like you said, there was no organized movement. It was just \"do your work\" and then go home. Because that's how life should be and fuck terrible bosses.\nCrazy bosses & media picked up on \"refusing to work 15 hours a day!! So lazy! They must want to quit!! They're telling me they hate their job!\" It became a stupid buzzword repeated over and over because \"news\" likes to sound shocking and make things up that\naren't a thing.'"
