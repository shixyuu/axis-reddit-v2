Its never been used right even when it was introduced. Quiet quitting is just “doing what you are being paid to do, not more”, which isnt quitting anything, and isnt really all that quiet either.\nHe left. Just write that he left the white house. After he got what he wanted, (and trump did too). Then he moved out and left.\nJfc'"
