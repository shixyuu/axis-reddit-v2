        "In response to 'As a recent grad who started a career this year, I'm so confused by \"quiet quitting\" and why anyone would be upset at it. I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'EXACTLY ... Frankly whenever I'm in places into a position where overtime or outside expected hours is pushed on me because I'm salary i ALWAYS respond with:\n\"Your expectation does not alter my availability; my salary is based off of a standard 40hr work wk with my agreed upon days and hours of 8-5 M-F. The negotiated mutual agreement was $Xk/ annually in reference to the above discussion. If you wish to alter your side of the agreement in any way then I would have to insist a formal renegotiation to discuss my increase in salary to accommodate your hourly expectations. Tho it's to be noted my work life balance being affected negatively comes at a steep increase to my salary.\"'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Facts ... I can't tell you how many times a coworker of mine messages \"Got down time, anyone need anything? \" or something similar.... I'm like SHUT UP ... we all WFH, if you have down time then fold your laundry while you wait for your headset to chime.... stop passively telling our bosses that our workload can be added to.'"
