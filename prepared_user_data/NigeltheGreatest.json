        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'I used to try to push the revenue by getting the phone calls done as quick as possible. Now after 2 pay raises in 12 years I now spend a lot of time just talking to customers. \"Oh you need parts for your tractor? Cool. Are you the original owner? Have you painted it? How's the wife? Got a new cat? Nice! What color? Have a dog too? Etc.. on and on.\" What used to be a 5 minute call is now 20 to 30 and I have a lot of phone friends and I look super busy for 8 hours a day.'"
