        "In response to 'There are millions of people who own a house and a newer car that are completely oblivious to what's going on out there. Many are shocked beyond belief when life happens and they find themselves looking at having to buy a house or a car.\nMany people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nA mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.', a user said: 'My car got totalled last year and insurance gave me 10% more than I paid after taxes in 2020. We looked at cars but I couldn't stomach spending so much on a car when I work from home and haven't missed driving.'"
