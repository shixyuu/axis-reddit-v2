        "In response to 'People who get smart stop working as hard\nLearned that lesson early in my career. Sadly, I kept forgetting it starting out.\nWould get the \"Cost of living\" increase of 2% every year. More than many get, but was not matching what I saw in the store.\nBusted my ass, 80 hour weeks. Leading multiple projects. Would get an A+ review and a ... 4% raise.  I mean, it'd double the previous year but again but at best matched the price of a gallon of milk.\nSo I did the math. Looked at all the extra work outside 40 hours I was putting in. Divided it by the extra 2% (exceptional raise - normal raise) and found out that I was getting less than minimum wage for those extra hours.\nAnd before someone chimes in. Yes, I did bust my ass and got a 'raise' that basically made up for the cost of living misses I had before.\nAnd yeah, I did end up changing jobs. And that's only way to get a real raise but you are also a bit limited in how often you do it. (can't do it every 6 months typically forever)', a user said: 'Seriously.  I get the same raise now that I did when I all but killed myself to do a good job.  I barely get shit done now and am getting promoted.  It’s some sort of reverse psychology.'"
