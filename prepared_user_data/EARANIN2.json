Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'HR practitioner and Millennial here. I don't think there is such a thing as \"quiet quitting\". Depending on the company culture and your direct manager, doing more than what is require can easily be taken advantage of rather than seen as an opportunity for advancement. There is a sweet spot of doing just enough to hit all metrics and going the extra quarter mile lol to get noticed and recognition for new opportunities.'"
