        "In response to 'Thank you. I did try to explain it to him when he was marking me down. The real irony is he was sitting there calling me a potential negative toxic presence that was going to ruin team morale the day after I had just handed out hand made Valentine's to my other teammates.', a user said: 'Anytime I had toxicity in my teams I always ask myself what can I do better as a leader not who is the source. It doesn't matter where it comes from. There is a reason it exists. Find it and fix it. That's the leader's job. While I realize you cannot make everyone happy, we should try to make the environment one our team can succeed in. Also, if they just want to complain for the sake of it, I let them. And I don't insert myself into private conversations either. If someone wants me to know something, they will tell me.\nYour boss is an ah. Especially blaming you for toxicity when he's clearly the source and he could HEAR you trying to smooth it over. If he wants someone to do the bare minimum instead of above and beyond, well he just succeeded.'"
