[External Link]: https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/09/09/analysis-shows-quiet-fleecing-us-workers-not-quiet-quitting-real-problem', a user said: 'Worked for a gaming tech company warehouse as a general worker. Basically sort big/bulky items onto pallets, once stacked up, assign a location for the pallet over to an aisle with a pallet jack. Repeat until I'm given item requests to pick from the aisle onto another pallet and repeat. Then repeat all day everyday. I'm basically dislocating a bunch of joints and shoulder muscles got me fucked up not even 30 yet.\nPoint is, I was tasked to do between 30-40 items per hour but because of my fast pace work ethics, I'd be doing on average about 100 items per hour. We were able to check our Workload Report on our computers. My most items in one day for Picking was about 1,012 items, minimum since I didn't know how to do average with the rest. Anyways, I was expected to do 280 in a day. This was all over the summer season when shit was hot as hell, breaking into 108* degrees outside the shipping containers. Drenched sweat nonstop and had puddle of water inside my mask as well.\nLuckily I just quit that job and gonna focus a bit on healing my body and do part time cuz the damage to ourselves is not worth minimum wage.'"
