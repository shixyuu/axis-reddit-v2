Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite.

        "In response to '\"Quiet quitting\" is acting your wage. I am paid to do specific functions at work. Once I complete those functions, I have no incentive to do more than what I am paid to do. It's that simple.\nWhy should I do more? I'm constantly being shown that any company has no loyalty to their employees. Employees want better wages and working conditions, so they try to organize and form a union. The company retaliates and closes the location, effectively firing the employees without actually firing them - thus skirting union busting laws. Companies have seminars or webinars discussing how employees can do more for their employer, but never the other way around. Companies cut every corner they can to steal wages from their employees to instead line their own pockets.\nSo no. I'll do what I'm paid to do, and nothing more.', a user said: 'Also, the less you do the less they can hammer you for making a mistake.'"
