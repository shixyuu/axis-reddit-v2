        "In response to 'Original Post: Bill Maher being very anti WFH and against quiet quitting the past year [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/6nykqc1bx0pa1.png', a user said: 'Bill Maher is an extreme extrovert, and he said time and again during lockdown that he didn’t enjoy the solitude. It frustrated him to do lockdown shows with just him, a distanced camera operator and his dogs because he didn’t have an audience and couldn’t gauge their reactions and feed off their energy. Going back into the studio actually improved his mental health and channeled his energy properly, but not everyone is like him.\nHe also has no clue what it’s like to have a normal office job, doesn’t have kids/childcare, and has enough personal wealth to have assistants, people to clean/shop/drive/schedule/manage for him, and all he has to do is show up. His experiences are not average, and he can’t relate at all. He needs to admit he has no realistic frame of reference to the working class today.'"
