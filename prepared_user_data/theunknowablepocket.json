        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting: Employees suffering pandemic burnout say they've just stopped working as hard [External Link]: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/08/14/what-is-quiet-quitting/10304956002/', a user said: 'I gave all I had at a large  ride share  company in the trenches doing in person driver partner support for three years. I’d even come in early to pick up trash around the building, stay late to wipe down the windows, and would volunteer during drive partner strikes to man the building and report to the city team off site. My mental health was absolutely destroyed. Panic attacks started and didn’t stop, couldn’t sleep, stopped eating, had a relationship end due to barely being able to get up and go outside. Landed in therapy and on anti depressants which helped take the edge off and I’m doing much better now but don’t feel like I’ll ever fully be the same. And all for what?'"
