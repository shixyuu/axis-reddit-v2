        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I’m still going strong in 2025.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting, how many people are actually doing this ? I keep hearing this term, just wonder if people are actually doing it.', a user said: 'Managed to make an extra $25k in bonus last financial year from doing far less than normal. I can’t make sense of it.'",
        "In response to 'The advice I give my team is to do one or two big things a year and stamp their name all over it - rather than doing 10-15 little things. Less is strangely more. But you need to be clued in to what the big things are', a user said: 'I’ll agree big time. My role is managing a contract/program and it’s not hard to shine as I’m technically working solo with two analysts supporting me with data. People don’t seem to understand that you need to put the stamp on projects/deliverables to get noticed, but not noticed enough where you can still fly under the radar.'"
