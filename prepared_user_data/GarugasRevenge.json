        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'Honestly what they call quiet quitting is just me being exhausted from my workload in some way. I would work harder than before because I want to get a raise, then I get more work, no raise, exhausted, then fired for unsatisfactory work. It's not really that I don't meet my deadlines, or that my work is bad, or that I caused the company any damage, it's just I'm no longer exhibiting the cheerleader personality they want to show off on newsletters. I'm no longer trying hard at work because I know it doesn't pay off, not even an anti inflation raise?'"
