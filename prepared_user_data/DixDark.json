I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'I just had a bad rating removed cuz neither I nor support could reach a customer and I was not able to find their apartment due to lack of any instructions and bad mapping of the area by google - left the order \"somewhere safe\", then I found out(by accident) that the apt complex is split in two parts and the apt I was looking for is on the other end of the street, tho the parking space with the apt number was in the first location, I wanted to move the order to customers door but somebody already stole it(the order, the door was fine).'"
