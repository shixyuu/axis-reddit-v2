Plus they were a pain to use.\nCellphones are ubiquitous and its extremely easy to send a text.  Social media is too and some people are silly enough to have their bosses as freinds on it.\nIt is a hell of a lot easier to get a hold of people nowadays.  If a person called you back in the day and someone was on their dial up modem the person calling got a busy signal. That's it no contact. If someone was on the phone busy signal means no contact. Back in the day you used to have freaking cassette tapes to record on your answering machine.\nNow you can text, email, call ,whatsapp, and msg through social media to a device that people have on their person almost all the time. All with low effort.\nIt's not even close to what it used to be like.', a user said: 'My phone is on silent always and read receipts are turned off for a reason.'"
