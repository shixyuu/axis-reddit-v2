        "In response to 'In my old job (construction) the more you did, the more you ended up getting compensated (in piece-work, even more true).  The funny thing is, is that the owner of the company I worked for says all the dumb shit like \" nobody wants to work anymore\" meanwhile he's got a crew of 20 guys, putting in 50-60hrs week 6-7 days a week (travel work)- literally all they do is work!  I mean, he pays really well once you gain the skills, starting pay is $25 plus per diem, ot, and dt.  Foremen are making $42/hr- you just need to find someone willing to trade their life for that.\nAnd buddy, it ain't worth it for how shit the industry is these days...', a user said: 'I can agree completely that was my first job outta HS and man the pay was good but the industry is shit! You really need to commit to that and accept you wonâ€™t have a regular life as other folks that work a regular 9-5 Job.'"
