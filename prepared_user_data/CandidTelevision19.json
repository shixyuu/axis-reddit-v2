        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'I think it depends on what the individual wants in life. If the individual does not want a family and can be contented with a 2/3 room hdb, no car or other luxuries, then less hustling is required. If the individual desire to have more, then more effort is expected.\nHowever like what most of our sisters/brothers mentioned in this post, we got to have work life balance, no point doing OT and putting more effort if your pay will not reflect the additional effort. I adopted this mindset for my job a few months back and never felt happier.\nThe people who lay flat in other countries does work part time to sustain themselves so some form of part time work is still needed (but with less stress) unless you have passive income to support your mortgage payment and other expenses.\nAt the end of the day, the question will be what you really want in your life and not what society/anyone else expect you to have.'"
