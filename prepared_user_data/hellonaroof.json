        "In response to 'Internet coming up with stupid faddy terms to describe something that has always existed.\nPeople who get their vocabulary from social media like this should be examined for brainworms.', a user said: 'Not sure it's the 'internet' so much as commentators with an agenda. Calling it 'quiet quitting' makes it sound like a dishonest or sneaky way to get paid for not doing your job.\nWhat it actually means is that people have finally realised that there's almost zero value in letting their free time be co-opted to make someone else rich.\nThis sentiment has always existed, but clearly the pandemic and various, associated economic crises, have got so many people to the stage of 'no fucks left to give' that it's upsetting the 'wealth creators'.\nEdited to make it clear that I don't actually buy the term 'wealth creators' (although for the sake of balance, there\nis\na percentage of business owners who do great things for communities and are a vital part of the economy in a way that isn't just extractive).'"
