        "In response to 'It's just the new buzzword for \"work to rule\", which has been a thing for decades.\nI don't like the phraseology around it, as it implies an action that shares similarities to quitting, when in reality it is people no longer willing to be taken for granted and go the 'extra mile' in return for shitty pay and rights.', a user said: 'I think it seems a shame that ‘quiet quitting’ caught on as the new slogan, I’ve seen ‘act your wage’ floating around and think that’s much more representative \nAnd from what I’ve read, ‘work to rule’ is a collective and purposeful action, whereas this is more of a general philosophy trying to counteract the current culture of workers being pushed to the very ends of what they can be convinced to do'"
