        "In response to 'This one isn't the annual so it doesn't really count towards anything that could impact pay/raises. If my next one goes like this I will be taking it above him, at that point it will potentially impact my earnings and I refuse to get docked pay when I do so much', a user said: 'They could be preparing for layoffs soon and using supposed poor reviews to get rid of the older/higher paid workers.'",
        "In response to 'Oh, that's the thing, I love this job, it's a good one, and one of the few that still has a union. He wouldn't be able to terminate me unless I actually did something crazy or consistently not meet my matrix.', a user said: 'He’s manipulating your performance evaluation to justify getting rid of you during the next round of layoffs.\nYou’ve been there 10 yrs so likely cost more than the new hires they can get cheaper in today’s economy. Companies don’t value the good, experienced workers like they should. And they really hate the unionized folks.\nI wish this was just paranoid babbling but unfortunately I’ve seen it too many times in corporate America. Be wary.'",
        "In response to 'I promise you, it's unlikely given the union. I've seen people scream in a boss's face in the middle of orientation with twenty witnesses during a department transfer and they are still working here. That guy didn't even meet his time frames. If all he has is \"she said 'yeah I agree, this sucks'\" I think I'm ok.', a user said: 'Yeah but you’ve been there 10 years. You probably cost more money than the guy who screams. Doesn’t matter if you’re a great employee.\nUltimately, when it comes to cost cutting measures, companies will go after the seasoned folks that command higher salaries than cheaper new hires.'"
