Absolutely no staying late or overtime, taking ALL the breaks and time off you were owed.\nIt was viewed as one step before going on strike.', a user said: 'Was “Other duties as assigned” a standard part of job descriptions in those days? If so, how did you get around that when on a Work to Rule?\nIf not, when/why did ‘other duties’ become A Thing? What changed to allow companies to get away with it? I’m assuming\nsomething\nmust’ve changed, otherwise why wasn’t ‘other duties’\nalways\nA Thing?\nI’m not trying to discredit you or anything; these are genuine questions. I’ve run into no end of grief trying to organise Work to Rules because of this ‘other duties’ crap; so if you know of ways around it, that knowledge would be very useful.'"
