        "In response to 'No one can honestly look at this last campaign and say she has low charisma. She’s definitely got Obama level charisma but we all want to pretend “oh sexism and racism aren’t a thing anymore”. From her debate to her podcast interviews to her SNL appearance - her charisma is top notch. A lack of charisma is not why she lost, but her strong charisma is why she’ll be hard to beat in a primary for the president or California', a user said: 'You lost me at the Obama level charisma. Is she Bob Dole? No she’s not but she’s closer to John Kerry level charisma  than she is Obama level. Regardless she lost because enough of the electorate is glitching in a throw the bums out mode for 8 years straight and she represented the status quo more than the mango dipshit that won.'"
