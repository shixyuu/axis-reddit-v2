        "In response to 'I hate the term \"quiet quitting\". It's not quiting in any way, shape or form. \"Quiet Quitting\" is abiding by the contract me as the employee and you as the employer have entered.  When a company hires a person they (as I view it) enter a business contract, a business deal,  more so than a hiring contract. The contract means I the employee have agreed upon providing a service to the employer in exchange for monetary gain (salary or hourly wage) plus what ever benefits we have agreed upon. In the contract is the scope of my job duties, what is expected of me. Anything expected of me beyond the scope stated in the contract is obviously outside the contract and renegotiation would have to,.should, needs to take place.  So  not going above and beyond is not quitting it's doing my job and doing smart business and not being hustled.\nFor instance if company A had company B  produce a good for a certain price and all of sudden company A demanded that company B  add a bunch of bells and whistles to the product being produced and company A clearly states they will not pay extra for  the new features company B is going to tell company A to kick rocks. Why? Because it's not what was stated in the contract.\nIt should be no different for employees. I am hired, this is the scope of the job, anything beyond that would be as we call it in my job extra billings.', a user said: 'The reason you hate it is because it's an Astroturfed term to denigrate workers who choose to work the requirements they were given to earn their wage, and not unpaid extras.'"
