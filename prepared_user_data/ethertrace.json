        "In response to 'We “worked to rule” for 2 days last year due to stalled contract negotiations. Our district retaliated by ignoring teacher appreciation week (not even allowing our PTO to appreciate us—individual parents paid out of their own pocket to bring us breakfast one day).\nAnyway, this field sucks.', a user said: 'Teacher appreciation week is usually bullshit or insulting anyway.  Always damaged my morale more than helped it.  It was usually like being told that your friends organized a party for you and then barely anyone shows up.'",
        "In response to '\"Quiet quitting\" makes it sound like the worker is acting maliciously by not constantly going above and beyond.\nAnother case of malicious miscategorisation.', a user said: 'When I first heard it, I assumed it meant subtly doing less and less work over time until you were either doing nothing or were fired.\nWhen I found out how people are actually using it, I couldn't stop laughing.  What a bunch of bourgesois propaganda.'"
