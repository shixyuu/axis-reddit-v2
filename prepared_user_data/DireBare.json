        "In response to 'Serious question though, (and totally sorry if my newness shows—only 1 year under my belt) but if our contract contains the statement “and other duties as assigned” under the job responsibilities portion, do we have a choice in this sort of thing?', a user said: 'You always have a choice. All of our contracts have that clause, \"and other duties\". It's not carte blanche for worker exploitation.\nIf you refuse unpaid extra duties, how will your admin respond? OP's admin stressed the dance was \"mandatory\", yet, no repercussions. Your admin might respond differently.\nYou either accept being exploited, or you don't. Working at a school that willingly exploit's its teachers like this isn't worth working for.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'The term \"quiet quitting\" isn't used consistently in the media . . . and teenagers are notorious for taking something out of context anyway . . .\nWhat \"quiet quitting\" (as I understand it) doesn't mean to do the minimum at your job, but rather not to overdo things . . . not to give yourself over to your work completely. Don't work overtime, don't stress about deadlines and obstacles you have no control over. Just do your job, within your 40 hours. If you are a teacher, that would mean no longer coming in early, staying late, working at home, spending your own money on the classroom . . .\nFor a student to \"quiet quit\" . . . if they were serious about it, it might mean not doing homework, or not pushing for that \"A\", just showing up and doing what you can during the school day.\nNot doing any work at all isn't quiet quitting, it's just quitting. And there's a lot more of that going around these days then there used to be . . . .'",
        "In response to 'That isn’t quiet quitting that is doing the work you are paid for. As a teacher I bring 100% during the school day but the moment my contract time of 4 pm hits I’m done and will not bring work home. Please don’t normalize unpaid overtime for teachers', a user said: 'Oh please.\nWorking beyond your contract IS normal in teaching. It shouldn't be, but denying reality is kinda foolish.\nI don't like the term \"quiet quitting\", but that's what it means. I prefer the term \"working to contract\". Same thing, but a better connotation.'"
