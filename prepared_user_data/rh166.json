        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I'm 50 yrs old and have been in sales for 27 years. 13 Spent running a company doing key accounts and direct import sales. We sold the company after a flood and my direction was 1099 commission sales.\nGo into something you might not have considered before. My industry changes by the season and it never gets boring.  If you enjoy it, it won't feel like work.'"
