Many were/are brainwashed into the whole 110% work, head down and don’t ask questions culture. Especially folk from minority backgrounds. No longer do people need to appease higher ups. As long as you can afford to live, work to rule.\nMakes me think that someone from that generation is responsible for this whole “quiet quitting” nomenclature.'"
