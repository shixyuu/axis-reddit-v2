        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'It's nonsense and in my country the law. Here an employer cannot make an employer do tasks that they weren't hired to do. Can't make a programmer clean the toilets, that's outside of the scope of their profession. So this whole quiet quitting nonsense is just rich people and managers to make more with less'"
