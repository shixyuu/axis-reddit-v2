        "In response to 'People who are studying HR? Maybe, I guess.  HR seems like a weird department to target here, but maybe I'm just used to working in a public education setting.  But in my experience, most HR professionals are just trying to\nhelp people apply/get jobs,\nunderstand their benefits once they get the job\nMake sure labor laws are being followed\nMake sure management understands those labor laws and doesn't say or do anything illegal.\nIn addition, in most government jobs, HR is also actively working to minimize the effects of systemic discrimination.\nSource: I teach at a community college and my wife (who has a BS in Biology, not HR) works in HR\nedit: at the same college', a user said: 'When I was young and na√Øve, I was working at a company and I saw an employee being demeaned and mistreated by her supervisor on a daily basis.\nA few of us got together and decided to go to HR (with the person's consent) about the problem.\nBig mistake.  Within 6 months, everyone from that group had either been let go or left out of fear.'"
