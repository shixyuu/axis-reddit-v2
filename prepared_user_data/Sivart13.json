        "In response to 'Are these dirt bikers breaking the law?  Don’t get me wrong they are super annoying.  There were probably 100 bikes in front of me driving on Sunday.  However they didn’t run the lights, weren’t on the sidewalk, not intimidating drivers etc.\nAgain if I had my druthers they wouldn’t do this as it is annoying as shit.  Is it illegal though?  I only saw them for five minutes so no idea what else they were doing but I found it curious they seemed to be obeying the law.', a user said: 'A lot of these bikes are not street legal, don't have plates, and are ridden by kids who might not be licensed.\nThey're often blocking the road, doing stunts that make marks on the street, making more noise than is allowed, and recklessly doing wheelies on the two-way bikeway.'"
