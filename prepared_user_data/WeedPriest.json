        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'This feeling hits me every vacation. That is why I usually take one-way ticket and stay as long as I want, then when the time comes, I buy plane ticket back home and in 1-2 days I am in my bed.'"
