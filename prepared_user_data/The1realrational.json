        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Only once we’re any nice to me.  I typically approach & tell them I am inactive. I am nice. They are rude & arrogant.  Once, at the airport, I went up to the man & asked how, Katherine, was. He was so rude.  I said, ”You know exactly which, Katherine, I am referring to.”  He never came over my way or anything. At a bus station, i set a bag slightly down on the table & this old guy came unglued.  I was picking up a book to thumb through it & he went into orbit.  I told him he wasn’t being, Christian-like at all.  I went on, how is anyone supposed to learn if you do not let us look?  I looked up local kh & wrote a letter of complaint about this man’s conduct. Another time, near a bus stop a lady got out of the car w/mags.  There were others waiting.  She handed out the mags.  As soon as I said I was inactive, she withdrew her hand from my direction & gave me a snotty look & said tbe typical, “Jehovah”, comments in a snotty tone.  Seriously, why would anyone want to be associated with such attitude?  They are to be Christian & exemplary, loving & warm.  Only, once, was this the case.'"
