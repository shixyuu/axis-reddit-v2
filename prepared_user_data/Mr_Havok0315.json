        "In response to 'Very interesting! I also had wreaths with the same decorations, icing colors, etc. No issues there. The only thing I did differently with this batch of cookies is this was a rush decorating job. I had these babies in and out of the dehydrator all day. Got all 5.5 dozen decorated though! Dry as possible. I couldn't make a dent in the icing anyway. They traveled there really well. Normally I take 2-3 days to get a batch decorated so I know they're dry.', a user said: 'Maybe the trees were still too warm?'"
