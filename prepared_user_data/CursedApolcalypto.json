        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'Ahhh... 'The Great Resignation'!\nBest thing i ever did (and unknowingly participated in).\nLeft work 2021 due to burn out (cited mental health in Resignation), was management in a large private company. During the first year of Covid asked to work longer hours, refused requests for extra resources and left mid 2021.\nStarted my own business in an unrelated field which is now flourishing. I'm very glad to have found the tipping point of being overworked in a toxic workplace. It was a stressful decision at the time, but so worth it and glad i did.'"
