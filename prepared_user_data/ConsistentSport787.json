        "In response to 'I don’t work as hard on my office days. I was told that we are there to collaborate and have in person interaction. So I’ll stop for tea breaks, I’ll go to the lunchroom to eat. There’s no one I know around but whatever, I’m doing my part. But I’m not staying late. I’m not rushing to get more done to make up for that break time. And if I leave on time, my laptop stays closed until the next workday. I don’t mind stretching my hours at home and if I’m interested in what I’m doing? I’ll probably forget to take a break. But not at the office.', a user said: 'Funny for me I am in an office alone lol. Love my RTO days after hr support. I can’t as the laptop is in the bag and can’t lol'"
