        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I used the time I saved by not going to unpaid business development events, or doing unpaid overtime to start studying again and change careers.\nAs of now, I work in a new field which I really like and has a better culture with regards to limiting unpaid work.'",
        "In response to 'WTG doing something productive with the time you saved and changing your situation.\nAre you tempted to quiet quit in your new role?', a user said: 'Thank you.\nI like my new role and the industry I'm in now, so I'm happier to put in extra effort. It's also a role that is a lot stricter on making sure you get compensated for overtime, so there is more incentive to put your hand up and take on more work when it's needed.'",
        "In response to 'Thatâ€™s refreshing in this day and age. What industry is that?', a user said: 'I'm now in urban design and planning. Which is a big improvement on work life balance compared to law.'"
