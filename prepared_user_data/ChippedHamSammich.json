        "In response to 'Part of it is right in your comment.  It’s the realization that what you’re doing, however valiant, isn’t working.  And also that your supervisor or management isn’t going to overturn an unfair decision no matter what you do.  Sometimes this isn’t even about how promotable you are.  It’s about someone being extremely happy with your performance in an underling role.\nAnyway there’s a saying about “the definition of insanity” that I think about often.  Like I said in a previous comment: if you’re not okay with toning it down and fading into the background, it’s best to find a new job.  In my case, I get paid a lot and would be crazy to formally quit.', a user said: 'This is so accurate. I was eviscerated in a thousand little cuts review when I tried to switch to a different team and got blocked.\nI was told “you can be doing your job but still not meeting expectations”\nI finally had to take fmla for a medical issue and have been peeking in and my boss has stolen multiple ideas of mine and not credited me while I am gone.\nI have decided to do a career shift that will take a few years so I am in full quiet quit mode when I get back.\nAny suggestions of how to handle reviews/1:1s? The trust with my lead is obliterated.'",
        "In response to 'So the point of quiet quitting is doing the minimum amount it takes to hold onto your job, because you still need it.  You’re just dialling back all the things that in your mind, made you a great employee instead of a good one.\nIn order to offset this new attitude, I highly recommend being ultra-pleasant when dealing with co workers and supervisors.  If you come in with the idea that “everyone is going to pay for what they did to me”, it will be noticeable right away.  Instead you’re going to snow everyone with a super positive version of yourself.  Seems painful, but you might be surprised.  It might actually make your life easier.  A lot of people don’t care about how good a worker you are, but rather, whether or not you’re likeable.\nBut for example, you will no longer have “good ideas” unless your basic job requires that you have them.  Alternatively, if you have to have good ideas, try to make them more public.  I had a boss that wanted to be a middle man to all of my emails.  He would get questions from higher-ups and then privately forward me the emails.  Then he could receive my responses and make himself look smart.  So when I responded, I added all the management back into the emails, to let them know the answer was coming from me lol.  My boss immediately stopped doing that.', a user said: 'Thanks for the response! I got you- yeah it was hard for me to be too pleasant because I had a health issue that was making it extremely difficult to even exist without pain. That has since improved. \n \nI found out my boss stole two ideas from me and presented the proposals as his own since I have been gone- which of course. I have just been the dog he has needed to kick since our team output is strong but he feels the need to no longer “inflate feedback” despite never even giving it prior to this. So, I am just going to ride this into obscurity and let them fire me if need be.\nHowever, having a pleasant attitude on the way out sounds nice. 😎'"
