Rich execs have maids, order whatever food they want or have someone cook it for them (a chef or stay at home spouse), have private drivers, 24/7 live-in nannies. Assistants to do basically whatever you need them to do. They're healthier because they can afford to be, so very few sick days.\nWhen you have that much money, you can easily buy your time back. So why wouldn't you want to come to the office? It's like it's FUN for these people. A fun, social time.', a user said: 'You also bring up a great point that bosses think work is \"fun.\" Because they're in a dominant position where everyone has to be at least slightly deferential to them; I've been in several more toxic work environments where we had to do light hero worship of the boss.  Bosses like the ego trip of being in the office.\nI personally have also worked at three different companies that were losing money or just breaking even, and the independently boss kept the company afloat with his own wealth. (Both times, the office environments were extremely depressing-- zero perks) But the bosses made way less money than they could at an actual job/ lost money, because they wanted to play \"executive drag\" and we had to play along with them.  One of those three companies was extremely anti WFH during Omicron, because the boss wanted to see his worker bees and we had to \"play agency\" with him.'"
