The cynic in me belive the rebranding is an attempt to demonize a valid way of organised labour to advocate for their rights. Working to the rules sounds reasonable and good, quiting but still getting paid sounds bad.', a user said: 'The cynic in me belive the rebranding is an attempt to demonize a valid way of organised labour to advocate for their rights\nIt absolutely is. We're currently in the midst of a power struggle between employers and workers. Not for a long time have workers had as many options as they do now, with lots of job vacancies going unfilled and people demanding home-working benefits, but employers are trying to hold out in the hopes all that goes away. Hence the reluctance by companies to increase wages even when they have vacancies open for months and massive short-staffing, and the intense pressure some companies and media outlets have been putting to return to the office.\n\"Quiet-quitting\" is just another term they are using to brand workers as lazy and unwilling, just like all the accusations that home workers are killing our cities and can't be bothered leaving the house. They want to turn people against each other and have the older generation sneering at the younger workers about \"how easy you have it nowadays\" and \"back in my day we worked hard and went the extra mile\". And it works because that's exactly what happens.\nAs far as I'm concerned, if I get below inflation pay-rises I'm getting a pay cut. And no one has ever had a pay cut and thought \"hey let's put in the extra effort now to thank my employer\".'"
