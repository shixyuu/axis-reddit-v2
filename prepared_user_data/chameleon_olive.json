Softquitting just means ur doing ur job and not giving a fuck. \"Looksmaxxing\" y'all didn't invent \"trying to achieve maximum attractiveness\" that's just called putting in effort. \"Softmaxxing\" y'all didn't invent using moisturizers and skincare\" \"hardmaxxing\" y'all definitely didn't invent using steroids and working out. Y'all can have ur cute little social media terms, but it's kind of obnoxious. \"Sigma\" .. y'all didn't invent trendsetters\nSigned, millennial', a user said: '\"Maxxing\" terms predate gen Z and are probably a result of millenials - they originated on less than savory imageboards as early as the mid-2000s, far before zoomers were able to really conceptualize anything language related.\nReally, you should be blaming yourself'"
