        "In response to 'And this type of worker is why companies are moving back to in office.', a user said: 'Why? These types of workers exist in office too. Managers are still responsible for replacing bad employees, their job doesn’t somehow happen automatically when in the office any more than wfh.'",
        "In response to 'I agree but it makes it easier for managers to hold people accountable and gather proof for dismissal.', a user said: 'Sounds like there is plenty of proof to me, OP says they can see the person is only logging 4 hours a day. Managers have access to even more tracking, so they have even more proof than that. There’s not really any additional evidence they can somehow only collect in offices, being non-productive is the information they would use regardless of\nwhere\nthe employee is being so. If a manager is so dumb they don’t know how to interpret “only logging 4 hours of day in the system” as evidence of work, they probably need to be replaced also.'",
        "In response to 'OP isn’t the manager though. That’s the issue.', a user said: 'Right, it’s OP’s managers job to deal with this. You said this is why companies are moving to the office, but I failed to see why a company would have better managers just by being in the office. If a manager is so bad that they can’t tell if someone is getting their job done, being in the office isn’t going to help.'"
