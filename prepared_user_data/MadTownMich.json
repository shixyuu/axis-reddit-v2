        "In response to 'Original Post: Gen Z isn’t quiet quitting. They’re rejecting outdated leadership I tend to agree. How about you ?\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/91281732/gen-z-isnt-quiet-quitting-theyre-rejecting-outdated-leadership', a user said: 'Making bonuses based on “team based outcomes” sounds like a group project where one or two people go above and beyond, and the rest of the group lags behind but wants the same bonus. Not motivational to me.\nWorkplaces definitely need to change to address generational difference in work-life balance. But Gen Z also has a lot to learn from experienced, successful workers too. Genuine communication and open minds are the key to long-term happiness in work and in life.'",
        "In response to 'Thanks for this response. A lot can be learned from the older generations and can also be very helpful. It can’t be one way. That’s where I think the disconnect is. Older generations really need to listen and work towards a mutually beneficial solution.', a user said: 'For sure. I’m unfortunately a bit in the middle of this as a Gen X “boss” of younger and older generations. It’s definitely an interesting navigation! And I am truly happy that you get generations are questioning the work-life imbalance that so many boomers committed to when they were young.'"
