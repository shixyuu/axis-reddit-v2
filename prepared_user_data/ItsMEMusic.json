        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'This is an astroterm, not a real one. Nobody uses this term. We call it “Having a Career.”\nThe real new term is Silent Sacking where they don’t give you a raise or COLA for years, adding job responsibilities and not giving compensation or titles.\nGet the fuck outta here with Quiet Quitting. Also, if you can’t tell your employee is looking elsewhere, you deserve everything you have coming to you.\nOh, yeah, and fuck 2 week notices. Can’t be Quiet Quitting if you give them 2 weeks. Not our problem they can’t fill a job with a body in 10 business days. Git Gud, Corpos.'"
