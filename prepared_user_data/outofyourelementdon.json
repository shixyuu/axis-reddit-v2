        "In response to 'What truly terrifies me about this generation is that they are the next workforce and they just... don't want to do anything. Like they are all so anti school and haven't realized that life is work, honey.', a user said: 'The kids are alright'",
        "In response to 'No, not really. Things have been on decline for a while now, a couple generations.', a user said: 'Can you elaborate? How, specifically, are entire generations inherently worse than previous ones? And how is the next generation even worse, as was claimed by original commenter that I replied too?'",
        "In response to 'The silent generation thought that the boomers were a bunch of whiny hippies and they had a point. Growing up the way they did gave them a great respect for what stability they could find in social structures. Boomers thought that gen X was a bunch of whiny slackers and in some ways they had a point. A lot of the hard work of social change had been done, the boomers had grown up in post war prosperity, and they couldn't understand the ennui of gen X. Gen x thinks that millennials are self centered and we kinda are. Gen z, whether we want to acknowledge it or not, is being pretty thoroughly fucked up by web 2.0 where you have to be on all the time, there's no escape from whatever your phone feels like spewing at you, and social media is creating more problems than the traditional media ever did.', a user said: 'Are you actually a teacher? Don’t you see how irrational it is to characterize an\nentire\ngeneration, tens of millions of people, as “lazy slackers” or “whiny hippies”? These characterizations aren’t based in anything tangible, just vague feelings and emotional reactions to things that are different.\nWhy did you start with the silent generation? Is it possible that the greatest generation had negative opinions of the silent generation? What about the generation before that?'",
        "In response to 'Long term sub. I'm saying that's the general consensus. Obviously the people taking surveys, giving them, writing retrospective books, writing documentaries, and the individual people I've spoken to have not had time to get up close and personal with every single living human being on the planet. I started with the silent generation because that's the oldest person I've ever spoken to, my great grandmother, and her friends. I can go back further but I'm going to have to get back to my reference books for that. I'm not really that into that period in social history. But yeah, off the top of my head I know that a lot of people had problems with the excesses of the 1920s. The loosening social and sexual mores, changes in fashion, changes in leisure time, and the decline in church attendance among city people really upset a lot of older and more conservative people. A lot of young people too. Not every woman in the twenties was a flapper. The flappers did upset a lot of women though, and a lot of men thought men in the '20s were becoming weaker too due to increased leisure time, more appliances, the beginning of convenience foods etc that's just what I know off the top of my head. I'm going to have to refer to my social history books for something deeper.', a user said: 'So is it likely that\nevery\ngeneration, to some extent, had criticisms of the generation following them? Does an older generation criticizing the following generation necessarily mean that said generation “declined” from the previous one?'",
        "In response to 'Are\nyou\nactually a teacher? Every single teacher I've talked to who's been teaching for ~10 years or more has articulated a\ntangible\ndifference in the work ethic, self esteem, and attitude of today's students compared to students less than even 10 years ago.\nThere is something deeply worrying going on in this generation, different than the generalized complaints about \"lazy slackers/whiny hippies.\" I am legitimately seeing a generation of students that will be woefully unprepared for adulthood, and that is not for lack of trying on the teachers' parts. There will be exceptions to this of course, but you can't use that to discount the fact that\nmany\nworrying things are happening.\nAnd this isn't some old codger yelling at a cloud here - the things I'm seeing are worrying even to me as someone fresh out of college, barely 10 years older than the middle schoolers I teach.', a user said: 'Parents, teachers, and adults in general have been screaming this exact thing forever. Kids these days face unique challenges compared to other generations for sure, but at their roots they aren’t any different than any other generation of kids that have come and gone. They’re kids, of course they seem apathetic about school… you’re telling me that attitude is unique to gen z’ers? It’s just so myopic to think that way'"
