        "In response to 'No. Just no. There was absolutely nothing “average” about people under 35-40 buying a home prior to the 90’s. That was rich people stuff.\nSource: am old.', a user said: 'I don't know how old \"old\" is but weren't the late 70s and 80s an anomaly because interest rates were sky high due to Volker having to squash inflation? I know housing was comparatively much cheaper during the 50 and 60s and my folks bought the 1900sqft house I grew up in in thr early 90s for like $85k, starting right around thr 2001 recession and it's recovery prices started really climbing way beyond normal. From 2009 to 2018 or so housing was very affordable.\nI so damn kick myself for not buying a 2000sqft house on a canal in Titusville FL I saw for sale at $105k back in 2013.'",
        "In response to 'The oldest Z is only 27. This idea that people under thirty routinely bought not only real estate, but NICE real estate is just not true.', a user said: 'They did, the average age of getting married used to be early 20s and first kid and house was late 20s. I bought my first house a little over 10 years ago at the age of 27 for $110k. Now approaching 40 and I'd need to make the money I do now as a senior chemist (over triple adjusted for inflation what I made back what I made back when I bought my first place) to afford to move back into the exact same house which now has an estimated price of $350k.\nFwiw,it wasn't any sort of awesome home either,1250sqft 3bd/2ba in a working class suburb of Tampa. In decent shape but has a small yard.\nSo yeah, less than a decade ago a 20 something could own a home, even a single one.'"
