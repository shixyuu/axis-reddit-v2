        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Yeah, this line from the boss didn’t sit well with me: “Well 1 remote day is better than what you had before so I don’t know why you’re unhappy.” So I started coming into the office only 2 days instead of my mandated 4 days and decided to let them make the first move (they haven’t, as I have most seniority in my entire division, even more than those in positions above me). I work in public service so I don’t get bonuses, overtime, or meaningful raises - I’m just holding on until I reach 25 service years.'"
