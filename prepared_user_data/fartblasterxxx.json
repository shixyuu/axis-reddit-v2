        "In response to 'Correct, it’s very demoralizing to work full time and still struggle. Millions of people are on a treadmill. Working hard but not getting anywhere.', a user said: 'Yeah and depending on your job you can do the math and see how bad you’re getting squeezed. I just left a job, there were 5 employees and the owner was making 3-5mil in profit per year, I was making 19.50 hourly, but before last year it was 17. I did all of the production, it was a couple sales people and warehouse workers. Sales guys got paid, rest of us got raped.'",
        "In response to 'Just like most places, sales make money so they get paid.  Everyone else is 100% pure expense and isn't worth a dime.', a user said: 'Yeah and the sales people absolutely should be paid. They should have paid me too because I had a unique skill that takes time to master. I feel for the guy replacing me.'"
