        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'When a employee does only what's expected of them and doesn't go above and beyond it's called \"quiet quitting\" and it's a problem. Yet, I don't think there's ever been a time when I've walked into a business and paid them to do something and they went above and beyond to give me more than what I asked for.'"
