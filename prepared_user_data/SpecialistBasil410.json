        "In response to 'Yes. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and reducing its balance sheet because they want to fuck you over.  Has nothing to do with the rampant inflation.  (/s)\nThey’re trying to make it possible for people to be able to afford housing and food in a few years from now.  As soon as inflation starts coming down, unemployment will start going up, then the job market won’t be so easy and many people will be glad to be employed at all.\nThis is all in the best interest of society.  10% inflation every year is not sustainable.  The Fed is a one trick pony and it’s the only way to fix it.', a user said: 'The problem with this (And I do in part agree, the FED has to attack inflation), is Powells policies completely ignore companies experiencing record profits (not just in absolute terms, but as %'s ).\nIf you are going to take the stance that wage increases have been substantial and beyond a sustainable level, you also have to look at the whole picture where profits have exploded too (under crazy wage increases) and attack both fronts.\nTalking about people being able to afford homes, without discussing how we're going to reduce the prices on commodities all humans need, will miss the mark and the \"steel manned\" argument you are making.'"
