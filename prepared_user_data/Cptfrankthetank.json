        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is a bs moniker made up by the capitalistic bootlickers. Doing your job within the scope of your job duties and not going beyond that is in no way an act of quitting. The capitalists are just so used to being in a power imbalance with the workforce that they now expect everyone to devote all of their life energy to the betterment of their shareholders profits. Sounds like the capitalists have a major case of entitlement disease. Whomever still uses this terminology is perpetuating a myth.', a user said: 'Quiet firing is more apt. They don't reward you for going above your scope and if they do it's peanuts. Then they wonder why no one is driven to go beyond.'",
        "In response to 'I'm so glad I finally work for a good company, where I can read stuff like this and realize it doesn't apply to me', a user said: 'That's great. But it def applies to most ppl.\nIt's only the last 4 years that I joined a great company and I should be grateful. Just tougher because of housing costs too. I make 3x the average LA salary but my housing is 3x times what it was back maybe 10 years.\nI'm definitely my choice to live in an expensive area. It just tough to see how callous some people who grew up here, inherited their house think it's down to hard-work when they would never be able to afford their area anymore.'"
