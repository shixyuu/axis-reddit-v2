I’ve been stuck in my position for 2.5 years. I have not gotten a raise since I started. I was promised a promotion a year and a half ago, and found out a couple weeks ago that promotion is no longer available. (Things were slow so i bided my time so I wouldn’t have to start over again with 0 seniority, trying to get the training I wanted) This whole time, I’ve also tried looking for jobs on sites like indeed or ziprecruiter, only for literally nobody to give me even a call back. Most of these positions I was overqualified for. So, I’m stuck. Company doesn’t care. So I don’t care. I’ll sit in my office for 6 hours a day, do a couple hours of actual work, and go home.'"
