        "In response to 'The best antidote to their class solidarity is to spread the good word of unionization.\nThis is how we win, and it may take us a while to gather momentum on unionization. But as the 60s showed, culture can change quickly. We have green shoots at Amazon, Starbucks, Apple, REI, etc.\nEven if there is no chance of your company unionizing, you can still point out to your coworkers the obvious hypocrisy of our current system. Like the loyalty the rich demand of us when they see us as plebs unworthy of job security or any respect whatsoever.\nWhen Bernie goes on FOX, he is doing the same thing - trying to win over a few people or at the least make them think about their views a bit. It's a long & slow game, but we have the right ideas & we must never give up.', a user said: 'Not only that. If I get a job in that tech scene now, you better believe I am going to demand a golden parachute comparable to those of CEOs. Oh! And you want to add a non-compete clause in the contract? You better believe it will mean paying the full salary for that associated period.\nIt might sound self-serving (and it is) but if enough people do it, it would change that mentality.'"
