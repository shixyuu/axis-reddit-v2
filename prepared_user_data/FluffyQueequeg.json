        "In response to 'I had a friend in high school in a similar situation. worse than the lowest mark was something called ‘non serious attempt’. He wrote an essay that was meant to be from the perspective of the director of the movie they were writing about and he ended it with something along the lines of ‘the red blood splattered on the white wall because it was the closest wall, any English teacher who says otherwise is reading too much into it’ and he was told his essay was ‘bordering not serious attempt’. He was like ‘bordering! What more can I do’', a user said: 'lol, this is me in the Subject “Religion” at a Catholic School.\nWe had an assignment that was to write “In 1500 words, talk about how you would convince someone to be Catholic” (or something equally BS).\nAnyway, this was a time when the Grim Reaper ads were on TV (the 80’s) and I used some poetic licence and did a creative writing piece where I met the Grim Reaper on the street and he convinced me to become Jewish 😂\nI was told that “it was supposed to be a serious essay and not a creative piece”, and my response was “where does it say in the question that it was not a creative writing piece?”\nMy report card said “A very disappointing effort. In fact, no effort” lol'"
