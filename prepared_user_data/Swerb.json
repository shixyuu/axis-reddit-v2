        "In response to 'Original Post: Gen Z isn’t quiet quitting. They’re rejecting outdated leadership I tend to agree. How about you ?\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/91281732/gen-z-isnt-quiet-quitting-theyre-rejecting-outdated-leadership', a user said: 'Millenial here checking in to say fuck yeah. Our (most workers) work situation has been deteriorating for so long and things need to swing back. Unfortunately, Millennial and Gen X had it just \"still good enough\" to not fight the good fight while we could. Now many of us have families or dependents that make such choices more difficult to make. I spent a lot of my 20s thinking \"why is shit like this, why haven't things been fixed yet?\" So I understand that feeling. Thank you all for any little thing you do to stick it to the system.'"
