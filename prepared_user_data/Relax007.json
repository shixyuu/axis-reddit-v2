        "In response to 'Yep. I first heard it when I was in school and the term was “work to rule”. Which meant you did exactly as the rules required and not a single thing more.', a user said: 'Yep. “Work to rule” is a term used in organized labor. No one wants to use it because they want everyone to think of unions as part of the past and the end all be all of workplace action. Fact is, workers can take organized action even without unions, and this is one of them.\nThey refuse to call it that because using an established term makes it seem like a legitimate tool workers can use to gain back some of the power they’ve lost to corporations in the last 40 years. Can’t have that. Must make up a new word and erase and historical context before anyone gets any ideas.'"
