I can perform the work of a week in literally 30 minutes. They are trying to relocate me in another team but I’m just stretching this as long as I can. They also tried to push me back to the office 3x a week but I refused as my contact is fully remote. Im waiting to be fired but more than six months have passed… it’s awesome but thanks to OE, else I will be having a really hard time. Fuck corporations'"
