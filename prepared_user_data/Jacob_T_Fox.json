        "In response to 'Original Post: What leaders need to know about quiet quittingâ€¦ aka the labor rebellion [External Link]: https://v.redd.it/xravs6qh8ot91', a user said: 'Quiet quitting or as it should be called \"acting your wage\" exists because there is literally no reward for doing extra work. Especially unpaid extra work.\nPeople are going to continue to quit jobs because the standard of living and what they actually give is going to continue to decline. When it gets to a point where there is no longer a reward for working a job, it doesn't do anything but exist to eat up time.\nWe've seen it everywhere with nurses, EMTs, Teachers striking and becoming non-existent because having that job doesn't add anything to their life anymore.\nThe only real way to change this is to pay people a livable wage. And I don't mean just barely scraping by poverty living paycheck to paycheck - I mean an actual, comfortable living wage that's in-line with the costs of things. To where you can cover your needs, and have some money to put away and/or for some luxuries.'"
