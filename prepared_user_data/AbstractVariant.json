Prefereably take a week completely off (PTO/holidays) and then stop over-archieving. \"Quiet quitting\" has such a negative ring, but moving back to 35 hours a week (7h days + 1h of sport/walk/nap every afternoon) to take care of your health can be an amazing decision. And you might find that if you are dedicated to use this free time to take care of your health you might even be more productive in this 35h than in whatever you worked before.\nGood luck, and hope you feel better soon!', a user said: 'I deal with a lot of frustration with the systematic exploitation and infantilization, so I decided that since they pay me to work 20 hrs a week (GA), I would work 20 hours a week and stop complaining. In reality, most weeks I work about 30. But sometimes 20 or less. And occasionally many more than 30 for a deadline, but I try to balance it out since they just don’t pay me to kill myself (but I do want to succeed).'"
