        "In response to 'In retail, \"Quiet Firing\" happens all the time. You don't like the employee for whatever reason, you just schedule them little to no hours until they leave. I've seen it happen so many times.', a user said: 'My now-wife quiet quit a fast food place like this. The manager didn't like that she didn't have 100% open availability when college started back up.\nWell she kept the 3-6 hour shifts because the place would CONSTANTLY ask for last minute shift swaps. She still pulled 20-30 hours every week at first.\nThen we planned our trip out of the country for the busy season (this area has big seasonality, like 3x cuatomers in the fall).\nWell she didn't tell the manager, we just left. She got a call in the airport right before we left NY.\nManager: \"Hey can you cover for Sarah on x/y/z dates, we don't have coverage\"\nWife: \"No I'm gonna be in France on that day, you didn't schedule me\"\nM: \"Well if you can't work during the busy season you're fired\"\nW: \"okay, good luck\"\nAnd then she collected unemployment because she had a recording of her being fired for refusing to work outside of the scheduled hours.'"
