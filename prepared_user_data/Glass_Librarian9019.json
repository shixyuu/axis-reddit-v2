        "In response to 'Greg's response is as follows:\nIf you just accept employees doing the bare minimum to get by, then you’re “quiet quitting” your job as a manager. Bottom line: You can’t force anyone to do anything. Employees who coast are usually disengaged from their work, so figuring out how to get them motivated is the only way to get them to naturally sustain higher engagement. If you can’t, or they won’t, then you can set expectations for performance and outcomes. And if they don’t meet those expectations, you can quietly fire the quitters.\nSource:\nhttps://nypost.com/2022/08/21/can-i-discipline-my-employees-who-are-quietly-quitting/\nI think this is bullshit. Greg doesn't know the meaning of the word \"minimum\". If you expect more than the minimum, then the level you called \"minimum\" isn't actually the minimum. The minimal level is the lowest acceptable level.', a user said: 'I worked on a small software team where we had to log all of our billable time against a particular client/project. For a while people would log their actual\nbillable\ntime and only that time. That meant it would normally be less than 40 hours, but in a crunch time everyone routinely logged more than 40.\nSo they decided to switch and require everyone log at least 40 hours. It's not a huge deal to expect your employees to account for all their time worked, not just billable time - it's actually more the norm in my experience. But they were such fucking dicks about it, insisting that 40 hours should be the\nminimum\n(heavily implying we should log more most weeks) every time it came up\nI was already looking for a new job and left a few months later but for the rest of my time there I made sure 40 hours was both the minimum and\nmaximum\nI ever logged in a week'"
