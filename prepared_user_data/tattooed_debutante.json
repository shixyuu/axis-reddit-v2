How about it’s called working hard and living up to your contract, then going home?\nThe French have this down perfectly and actually regulate when the worker is expected to view emails.'",
        "In response to 'A better phrase is simply “fulfilling the terms of your contract.” An employment contract is just a deal between two parties - one side offers services in exchange for money. You wouldn’t go and buy a car from a dealership and then get home to find that the sales exec who sold you the car is there washing your dishes. That would be ridiculous, so why should anyone be expected to do more than was agreed in the contract in this situation too?', a user said: 'Sound logic'"
