        "In response to '“quiet quitting” sounds an awful lot like corporate boot licking propaganda.\nThis phrase is new to me as of about five minutes ago, so my associations with it are limited to what's in this thread.\nTo be honest, I kinda like it?\nI quiet quit at the start of the pandemic and my life has been much less stressful since. I'm a huge fan of not doing extra unpaid work. And funny enough, no one's even said anything negative to me about it, so it's not even had downsides. 10/10, I'm planning to quiet quit for the rest of my life.\nI don't understand why it's supposed to be a bad thing.\nCan we just, as workers, take this phrase and use it as a positive? Encourage others to quiet quit, talk about how nice quiet quitting has been, etc? (Or, could someone explain some context here I'm missing about why this is inherently a negative phrase?)', a user said: 'It's not my term, but 'work to wage' explains it better from the labor side'"
