Power to the people and all that.', a user said: 'This! If my admin tried to make me work unpaid, it’d be a quick email or phone call to the union. They know that, so they don’t ask us to do anything unpaid.\nI stayed a little past contract hours today, and my admin popped in to ask if I’d be leaving soon because he wanted to leave and set the alarm. Talk about a work-life balance!'",

I used to have it when I was a lead. Nope, I’m good. I live way too close to my site to have that code!'"
