        "In response to 'Remember the event they had a booth and she complained no one was supportive of the business?  I vaguely recall complaints of not getting any support, wanting the other wives to devote more time and support/build the business.  Funny thing was she had No Concrete Ideas as to exactly How they were to do anything, What she thought they should do to build the business.  Basically complained they weren’t doing enough but didn’t know what they needed to do for it to be successful.  Like get a decent designer (fire doodling Robin), make a product that appeals to people outside your family and get into a different business.', a user said: 'She and Kody are so similar. They love get rich quick schemes but don’t want to put in the effort to work a real business and have success.'"
