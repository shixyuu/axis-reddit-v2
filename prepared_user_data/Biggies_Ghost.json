        "In response to 'This breakdown is so important, thank you for explaining it so succinctly.\nThe expectation to go above and beyond in the service of your employer while they simultaneously minimize your importance and suggest youâ€™re replaceable at any moment is so degrading.\nThe dynamic they cultivate is one that is commonly seen in abusive relationships.\nHigh value of the person in the beginning. As the honeymoon phase ends and people start to get comfortable and confident in the security of the dynamic, the person with power attempts to push the person off-balance, with degradation, humiliation, threats, coercion, and manipulation. They move quickly into devaluation, keeping you in a position of deep insecurity and fear that prevents you from gaining the confidence to leave. We end up accepting much less than we deserve for more work to appease an unrelenting, critical and unforgiving power.\nWe are expected to be grateful for their kindness and deference when it is given, yet it becomes increasingly fleeting, with more and more strings attached.\nThe pandemic flipped the power dynamic and everyone got to collectively witness this shift and gain a clearer understanding of their value in this society beyond just their labour contribution to some insatiable machine. I just wish we maintained more pressure on these exploitative systems to prevent it from moving back so quickly to the abusive relationship that was normalized.', a user said: 'Reading your post suddenly brought me back to why I quit working for a corporate franchise and started working at a privately owned small business. You are absolutely correct with your description: It was GREAT, at first. By the time I walked out, I had been so beaten down, I didn't even realize it was making me miserable until after I left.'",
        "In response to 'I think I'm in the same boat, but I'm not seeing a good way out. What advice do you have on finding jobs with smaller businesses?\nIt might be the field I work in (logistics), but it seems like any small business either is never hiring or hiring for a low paying customer service position. The only jobs I see with significant pay are at large companies, too far to commute (2+ hours one way) or too demanding (45+ hours per week minimum). Or even both.', a user said: 'I wish I could give you some awesome advice, however, I work at a hairdresser. For me, it was just a matter of finding the right private salon. I found a shop where the owner was willing to pay hourly until I made a good commission. The location is ideal for walk-ins, too, so there is a lot of potential to build a book quickly.'"
