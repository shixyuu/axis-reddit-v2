        "In response to 'I was calling it coasting previously but this phrase is 100% better as itâ€™s a wage problem, not an ability problem.', a user said: 'Not really. Coasting is doing less than expected, but close enough that it isn't worth the hassle to fire you. It was really easy in the 50s and 60s.\nIt's actually pretty hard nowadays. The ruling class is so out of touch that they'll fire you at a whim. (US, \"at will\" employment. YMMV.) The costs of training (or the even higher costs of not training) a replacement are ignored because there's no ledger account for them. (They'd probably be ignored as \"not real\" anyway, like depreciation.)'"
