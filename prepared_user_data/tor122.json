        "In response to 'Companies must define clear KPIs to measure productivity, and act quickly if they are not met.\nSome of us here have OE’d for longer periods because we still deliver to those goals. OE doesn’t always mean we slack it off.\nIn many cases, we’ve gone to higher positions making 30% more and working twice as much. With OE we stepped down to be a highly effective IC and still put in the extra time, yet now I’m putting that extra effort in another company and making 100% more instead of 30%. It’s just logical.', a user said: 'Do you understand how rare that is? 90% of employers in this era have no idea how to measure productivity. Tech companies are better about it. Head over to a bank, insurance company, pharma company, or another firm like that. These places have NO IDEA how to measure productivity. That’s a big reason firms like Goldman Sachs pushed RTO. It wasn’t some desire to get ‘value’ out of their CRE - Goldman’s CRE is such a small part of its balance sheet. It was because no one at that company could figure out how to measure productivity.\nTo many, many people ‘presence’ is the same thing as ‘productivity’. At my first job, I used to show up early and stay a little after 5. Wore a suit every day. People thought i was the most productive guy ever, getting a shitload of work done. Reality? I maybe put in 10 hours a week and spent most of the day studying for my masters classes.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: When you quiet quit/ride it out till you get fired, it negatively affects others in this community I had a teammate who had been dropping the ball for a while and was finally let go this week. His output was so bad that my manager noticed and did some digging. Turns out he barely worked at all and was clearly just coasting till he got fired.\nWell, my manager and skip are PISSED and literally called out how they think our old teammate was working multiple jobs. In my xp, they definitely were as they had many signs.\nRegardless, it’s now coming back to bite my team and me with new policies. Yes I’m pushing back on all the BS coming our way and trying to minimize it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if activity monitoring software came up soon to flag suspicious activity as well. This gig has been great for OE for years and now it’s in jeopardy because someone couldn’t just quit when they were done… I have friends (OE and not) at multiple other companies who are dealing with fallout like this as well.\nMy point being, when you pull the anti work card and coast like this just waiting to be fired (which I see recommended here daily), it’s not an isolated event. You get your bag a bit bigger and your teammates (and fellow OEers) deal with the fallout.\nIt helps to push for more RTOs that may have not as it eliminates the possibility of many of these issues. This also affects remote offerings (wayyyy down from what I’m seeing myself in new job hunts)\nHow would you feel if others put your extra paycheck(s) in jeopardy?\nGet your bag, but don’t screw others over while you do it.', a user said: 'Every single point you make in this post I could use as an argument against the whole idea of OE in the first place.\nHonestly? I doubt that guy was over employed. A lot of people really are just that stupid and/or don’t care about their jobs. I’ve seen this so many times in my career. Some guy doesn’t give a shit about his job, coast collecting $, and just quits last minute or gets fired. Management freaks out for like 2-4 weeks and then just moves on. Most over employed people are a lot smarter than that. Stupid people can’t handle the stress.'"
