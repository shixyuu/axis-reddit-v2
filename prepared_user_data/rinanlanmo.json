Some days in Enterprise sales you feel like you had negative or zero impact on your work and it’s not always easy to swallow.', a user said: 'For what it's worth I will offer some perspective.\nI did sixteen years in the trades before moving into sales.\nIt was 12x the effort with a side of permanent damage to my health for 1/6th the compensation. And I am nowhere close to one of the highest paid people on this sub.\nThe hardest you've ever worked out in your life ain't shit compared to a 14 hour summer day digging.\nMay be you would love it and feel genuinely fulfilled. Different strokes and all. But the grass ain't always greener.'",
        "In response to 'Lol I do really love a lot of things about sales and my job but I’ve also been doing this for years.\nWhenever I’m stressed as hell I become super jealous of the incredibly mundane, stress-free jobs of those around me. But then I remember I make more money than them and that’s why I’m in sales.', a user said: 'The stress of sales vs the stress of choosing whether to pay your rent or buy food this week.'",
        "In response to 'I have complete control over my schedule, but if I want to hit quota taking a long vacation puts my quarter at risk.', a user said: 'That's still an issue. Whether that's a you issue or your company setting quotas, I don't know. But that's not a universal sales situation.'"
