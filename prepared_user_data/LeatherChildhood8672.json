        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'Hi, I don't think I have much of advice, but been there! I was very much like that in my first job, and I was like that for about 4 years. All added the stress and responsibility for nothing, because I didn't realize that what I'm doing is not helping out, but essentially covering for people that can't be bothered. I much more enjoyed working on my own afterwards because I could do my job well, and didn't had to worry about others. Now in my new job, it kind of happened organically with quiet quitting. First, I was full of: let me help you, etc, untill it turned again me. As well, it seems lots of departments were in utter chaos, so not only I have to do my job, but catching up two years old paperwork that has to be processed but no one was doing. So basically doing job of people that have left place in chaos. I do my responsibilities now, but I'm not breaking my back to catch up with paperwork that nobody done for years or clean their mess'"
