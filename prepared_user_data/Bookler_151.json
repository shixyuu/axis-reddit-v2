        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'Much to my surprise, I’ve started to enjoy grocery shopping (alone). I go to the “fancy” grocery store and get a little coffee while there. I like picking out what I want and focusing on health/simple. So protein, grain, veggies and fruits as snacks. I use Meal Lime and it categorizes everything.\nMy husband is great at it but he gets “whatever is on sale” and the same old things. I’m pescatarian and so that makes it tricky. I’m starting to cook more and finding that roasted veggies with seasoning are the easiest thing and the kiddo loves them.'"
