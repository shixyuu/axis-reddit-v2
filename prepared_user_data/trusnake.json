        "In response to 'LOL. This was mid to late 90's, and they were scripts that automated a lot of server maintenance tasks, reporting, proactive troubleshooting. As a consequence of \"not having the right people on the bus\", many of my peers were inexperienced and wouldn't take a moment to learn anything new unless it was spoon fed to them. I get tired of doing repetitive tasks, as well as just reacting to whatever blew up that day. My scripts just made my job easier day to day, and created automated reports that my manager thought were gold.\nI also can't emphasize enough how absurdly stupid most of the other employees were, because the business thought they were clever by paying the minimum possible salary. I was a bit more experience and hired at a higher salary, but it was constantly held over my head. I as pressured to work off hours, be on call, take on \"stretch assignments\", etc.\nPro tip: If you can do a little scripting, your peers and managers who don't know how to script will think it's magic. (Same for strong Excel or PowerBI kung fu.) This is especially valuable in environments where non-technical managers are overseeing technical people.', a user said: 'This is extremely true.\nI work in an underwriting capacity, and it’s shocking how nobody else has created any VBA scripts in excel to automate a lot of the math. (And produce reports from it.)\nHeck, with OCR So accessible these days, I’ve probably automated 75% of my workload.\nGoes without saying these chucklef*cks wouldn’t agree with me, but I built these scripts on my own time, on my own computer, and have no IP wording in my contract so I own them. I’m being paid to produce results for this company, and how I choose to achieve those results is immaterial.'"
