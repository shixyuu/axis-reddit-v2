        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'If they pay me salary and still obey overtime laws for salaried employees, i would be happy to take calls outside of normal work hours.\nI would also expect to be allowed to come and go as i please as long as the outcome of my work is still acceptable.\nEdit: of course certain things like meetings, things that obviously require me to be there, or other on site responsibilities and client interaction may require an on-site presence, but I'm wouldn't be okay with arbitrarily being required to show up to the office without good reason.'"
