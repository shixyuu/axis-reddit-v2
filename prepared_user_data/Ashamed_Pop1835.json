        "In response to 'I always wonder how enforceable this actually is — I mean, I can see it for one off things (there's some event so you have to stay late). But if the company gets bigger/busier, when is it the company's responsibility to hire more staff vs you being told to pick up the pace?\nAs in, to put concrete numbers on it — if you could get all the work done in 39hrs people would expect that you just have to suck it up & work late / through lunch. What if it's more like 47.5hrs hours & you're doing that indefinitely?', a user said: 'So long as the extra hours don't interfer with other employment rights, then it's enforceable.\nWorkers are entitled to a 20 minute break in any shift longer than 6 hours, 11 hours rest between shifts and a 24 hour period without work each week. If, for example, you were being forced to work through lunch and therefore missing out on the legally required 20 minutes rest, then the employer would be breaking the rules.\nEqually, if the number of hours were such that your average wage became lower than the minimum wage, the employer would again be in breach of employment legislation.'"
