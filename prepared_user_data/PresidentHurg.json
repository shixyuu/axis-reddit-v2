I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'This is why it's so important to always copy the text in the job opening and safe it somewhere on your drive. Whenever salary or responsibility comes up you can point at that text and state you were hired for that and nothing more. Many people take on responsibilities because they want to help or think they will get recognition. Then time passes and people start expecting them to always fulfill that function.'"
