        "In response to 'Literally decades of not matching inflation in wage growth, and increasing workloads. Constant denials of requests for additional headcount. Paying market rate for the clueless new guy but punishing those who favour stability despite them having valuable knowledge and skills the business depends on. Increasing expectations of availability and reduced response times. Why didn’t you read the email I sent at 6:30pm last night before our 8am stand up meeting? Layoffs at the slightest hint of a recession. Refusal to invest in tools and training needed to be efficient. Constant requests to just “spend less” but no reduction in targets.\nWhy the fuck would anyone go the extra mile these days?', a user said: 'My coworker and I got our certification at the same time.\nFinished the same class, from the same school, at the same time. Got hired on for this job, at this title, at the same time.\nThey are paid more than me, but they only work part-time, and based off of any audits do much less work.\nThe employer put me in a different region on paperwork to pay me less - I'm literally the only employee at our location that has that region code.\nI like them, but Fuck This.'"
