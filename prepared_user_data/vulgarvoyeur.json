        "In response to 'My store at a large chain has about 16-18 employees when I came in to the store as the GM. At the end there was 3 of us plus me and I was still operating the store but at a noticable drop in everything. There was zero urgency to up pay passed 10 an hour. Zero urgency to up pay passed 12 for assistants.\nThey had me fill out a business report of surrounding businesses to prove I couldn't hire. The DQ next door was the lowest paying business. 14 an hour for 14 year olds. 18 an hour hour for 16+ and 22 for assist managers. Even though I was technically salaried and working much less hours then expected, it was still shocking to find out that if I had actually followed the policy on hours the fucking dq Assistant manager made 5 more an hour.', a user said: 'I will full OUT my employment history at MOD pizza for a similar situation. They were hiring at 10.50 then REDUCED to 10 because that's what their market research told them was the area's average. Yet from living in the area I know that's false and gave appropriate feedback to the out of town corporation. As a GM I was making 45k/yr plus bonuses. But considering I couldn't hire anyone on including regular restaurant turn over, I was working 70/hrs a week. That brought me to just over 12/hr. My key holders were making more than me. Significantly more than me when you factor in OT that I wasn't eligible for as a salaried employee. When I quit I gave a month's notice because it was obligatory in my contract. \nNow I've been at a local joint that takes care of it's employees for 3+ years and they are paying very competitive wages. I'm making more, doing less, working right under 40/wk.'"
