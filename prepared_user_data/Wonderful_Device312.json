        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting - How do I do it properly Been at J2 for 9 months. Reorg in March completely dismantled my team. Manager new what was happening and fled to a new team.\nWas assigned to a new team a couple of months ago. Have not had any work assigned in almost a month. I log on. Attend a couple of team meetings. And that is it. Asked my current (new) manager if there were opportunities to hop on other projects. They pretty much responded by telling me to enjoy the free time and that they would get back to me. A new manager for my team will be hired within the next month.\nI've applied for an internally posted role with no success. No response to application.\nAny thoughts on how to handle this situation. I literally am doing nothing and earning a paycheck. Am I wrong to continue logging in until I get let go?\nThought about taking PTO for a week. Thinking now that I should just save my PTO, log in, start my mouse jiggler, and go about my business.', a user said: 'Save your PTO. Instead ask your manager to pay for some trainings on udemy or whatever. Someplace they won't really check or that you can mostly fake course completions.\nSpending downtime training makes you look good. It also gives you an excuse to not be super attentive to emails or calls. You can just fill your calendar with \"training\". As an added bonus, if the training requires software you don't have on your work computer you can use it as an excuse for why your work computer might be logged off for hours at a time. \"Sorry, I was in training\".\nOh and whatever you do don't quit. When or if they finally realize they don't need you and they lay you off, you'll probably get a severance. Even more money for doing nothing.'"
