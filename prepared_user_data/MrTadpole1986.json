        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Me male HL wife LL Have you reached that stage ? Quiet quitting not leaving because of kids or what not but just quitting on the idea of romance in your head letting go of the resentment for your own mental health  and accepting that she’s just a roommate now ? We had yet another talk yesterday about it which she acknowledged the situation made promises again and that night it was just heavy snoring, told her today that I’m disappointed that our discussion led to no improvement even after her promises she said but we both agreed to make efforts ( because yeah I turned LL4U after all this time) I told her it’s ok I don’t even want to talk about it, I’m not even pissed as usual , she’s snoring as I’m typing this next to me and i don’t even care i don’t want her anymore and the sad part is the idea of getting to this point used to scare me but now I just don’t care, I don’t even think I love her anymore just that I’m used to her.', a user said: 'For my own sanity I call it acceptance instead of quitting. Don’t know why but it feels better. I’ve accepted we will never have a healthy sex life. I’ve also accepted I don’t want to step outside the marriage even with the permission she gave me. All I want is her and it happens once in a blue moon. Am I happy with that? Not in the slightest but by choice I have no other option. I’m done feeling destroyed about it. I begrudgingly accept it and try and enjoy being with my hot best friend everyday. Not sure how healthy this is but it beats feeling sorry for myself all the time. Some days are worse than others like today (hence the reason I’m here on db looking for some  kind of solace). But I know I’ll feel better when I get out of my head and get one with the day.'"
