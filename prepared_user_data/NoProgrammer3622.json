        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting, how many people are actually doing this ? I keep hearing this term, just wonder if people are actually doing it.', a user said: 'I was \"restructured\" out of the way for wanker company yes man. I told them that they were essentially making me redundant, so they should just pony up and stop trying to bully me out. Thankfully, I had a week of sick leave longer than what they would have owed me with a golden handshake for my 11 years of service, so i just took that. Fuck those cunts. I've started my own company and am killing it. No more \"do you have processes in place for this?\" Or passive aggressive cc'ing of management more senior than me being included in stupid emails. Lol'"
