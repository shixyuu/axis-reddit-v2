        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'I have been working in Tech for a little over 20 years and the company I'm at is super mad about their employees \"quiet quitting\". They refuse to give them more money, bonuses or introducing a 4 day work-week and they're just so booty-blasted about their lack of ideas panning out for them.\nIt is truly frustrating to listen to them talk, knowing that they have NO idea how the world works and somehow think that an occasional pizza party is all that is needed.'"
