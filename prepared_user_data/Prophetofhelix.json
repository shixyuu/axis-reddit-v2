The elimination of classes around home economics and teaching usable life skills is a travesty; they should have been expanded upon, not removed. :(', a user said: 'Hilariously, at my vocational HS, I never tried to get into \"college prep\" courses since I knew I planned on starting at community College which wiped your HS records anyway.\nSo I middled to did good in HS but never all star student.  Which meant when most of my friends took a collegiate math class, I and the \"average\" kids had to take social economics.\nBasically a class that taught us labor laws and about credit cards and loan rates, filing taxes, OSHA and everything you actually need to know.\nSo my friends knew a few more calculus equations than me...and I did their taxes and explained labor laws to them. Hindsight, I feel like I got the better deal'"
