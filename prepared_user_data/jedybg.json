        "I tried quiet quitting before it was cool (2014). Worst idea ever. Here's my story 👋 A bit ashamed to share this & might get in trouble (might've been better to share this anonymously 💁‍♂️ but that's who I am); I'd rather be authentic.\nHeyo, I'm Jordan 👋\nIn 2013 I started my first enterprise engineering job.\nI was coming from startups, so 16-hour workdays and sleeping in the office were my day-to-day. Lots of work.\n​\nThe hiring process was easy (startups teach you a ton; we were making games — way more complicated than enterprise software). I was hyped to start.\nBut something quickly stood out to me – there wasn't much I could do. There was work for about 1, maybe 2 people MAX and the team was 10+.\nNot enough to sway me 💪, so I started improving things no one else was touching (we were not in HQ, and the guys in HQ were... territorial).\nSpent a few weeks improving some code and... had to send it over email (for programmers, this is ridiculous). No response.\nSecond email. No response.\nThird email. No response.\nTalked to my boss — not much else to do.\nMy days looked like:\n👉 2 hours of meetings\n👉 lunch\n👉 4 hours for meetings\n👉 2 hours left for work, but most were spent talking to colleagues (great people) because there wasn't much work\n​\nI coped with that by spending all of my time at work learning stuff. My computer was kind of shit, and there were enough limitations, so I was doing mostly theoretical learning online.\nThen the company started optimizing the team.\nSomething that they've been planning since before I joined was to change our primary technology. That wasn't something I wanted to do, and I was kind of pissed that no one mentioned it at the interview since they had this plan all along.\n​\nEnter Quiet Quitting\nUp until this point, I was trying to help out. I couldn't for the majority of my time and felt like the company is not giving me a good ground to do so, but I tried.\nAt that moment, I just said \"f*ck it!\" and decided to do the least possible.\nThe bad news?\nIt worked.\nI spent 2 years doing nothing. Absolutely nothing.\nNow, that might sound like a dream to some of you, but here's where it lead me:\n​\nThe results from quiet quitting\nSpending 8 hours of my day being a lethargic slug, turned the other 8 hours of my day into a lethargic slog.\nI didn't have any motivation to do anything.\nI didn't have any momentum to do anything.\nI didn't want to do anything.\n​\nAnd that comes from someone who spent his ENTIRE time writing code 🤦‍♂️\n​\nAfter finally leaving that job, I failed my next startup because I couldn't get myself to work. I forgot how.\n​\nI got into the biggest depression of my life. Thought about taking my life too. F*ck, it's painful to even remember that period.\n​\nIt took me the next 5 years to get back to square 1. To get my life in order. To get my habits in order. To start loving work again.\n​\nWhat to do instead\nDuring the last 8 years: I learned a lot, started writing, grew to the highest possible engineering grade (Principal Architect in my current company), started leading an excellent team of 15 people, and started making content to help others.\nHere's what I would've done if I had my knowledge back then:\n​\nTry changing things — do your best to change your current situation so your work gives you what you need — satisfaction, challenges, and/or money (I did that 🥳).\nℹ️ this happens by talking to people. I didn't do enough of this 😢\nNegotiate terms — find who you depend on and negotiate terms. Be ruthless. You are giving value to your company, and you deserve your company to take care of you. But you need to negotiate to make the terms clear and to improve them — no one will do it for you.\nFill your time with things that grow you — how you spend your days is how you live your life. Don't let yourself do nothing. Or you will fall in a hole you'll years to dig yourself out of.\nChange your company — don't settle. Job hunting is hard as hell, but you can do it. Improve your CV, work on your communication skills — you can do it!\n👋 Here to help with this\nBuild your own business — alternatively, don't quit and spend all of your time & energy on building your own company. You'll learn a lot and grow a lot. Even if it doesn't work.\nAgain, and I can't say this enough times — talk to people. Your communication will build your network. Your network is your net worth. In any company and outside.\n(here to help with that as well)\nI hope that was useful to you!\nYour biggest fan,\n— Jordan",
        "In response to 'So I’ll say, I am a quiet quitter. Been so for about a year. This came off 5 years of 60 to 80 hour shifts (I’m a software developer). My worst week, was 109 hours. My worst “stretch” was 32 days straight of work, without a day off… 12 hours a day.\nAfter I learned that managers will take everything they can from me, if I allowed it. I stopped. I stopped everything. If the work wasn’t in the text of my contract I didn’t do it.\nToday, I spend my days essentially not working. I work maybe 12-16 hours a week. The rest of the time I spend on courses for training on things that interest me (like currently I’m learning statistics).\nI also fill the time with stuff that interests me. I’ve never been happier. I make a 6 figure salary and my work was evaluated… I got back “excellent” as my assessment.\nNo regrets. Living a life doing things I enjoy vs doing things that are purely profitable has been a huge boon to me happiness and mental health.\nI love being productive. I like being productive for me.\nTo each their own.', a user said: 'You aren't a quiet quitter man!\nI read your story and all the comments below.\nYou sound like you're doing a helluva job. Respect!\nThe fact that you're super effective time-wise doesn't make you a quiet quitter. It's the opposite.\nYou're showing the it isn't the amount of time invested that determines the results — it's how you do it. Being well rested with a wide open schedule seems to let you function extremely well as a manager (I think that is the way to better management but I digress).\nAnd the 100 hour work weeks and all that is just abuse.\nWorking normally is not bad.\nWorking effectively shouldn't be punished.\nYou're doing great. Respect!'",
        "In response to 'My brother had a somewhat similar story. He basically built a bot that did his job and then hit a button to run it each day. Then he got depressed and felt really purposeless and thought he could start a business but just wasn't happy. Anyway, his company recently did a re-org and gave him a more hands-on job. Last time I saw him he had dropped a ton of the weight he had gained and the dark circles around his eyes were gone. I was worried about him for a minute there, but it seems like things are looking up. Thanks for sharing this. I hope you help some folks.', a user said: 'Awesome to hear that, I'm excited for your brother! 🤩'",
        "In response to 'Thank you for sharing your story. I had no idea this is called \"quiet quitting\", but I understood I am step by step taking exactly the same direction and I feel how it drains motivation to live.\nBuilding the business... yes, that helps until you find out there are the same people around you and you are drowning together even faster as this slowly becomes your lifestyle.\nI am happy I find the curiosity to start a discussion without waiting years despite the fact I could use more appropriate words but it solved the purpose to break the chains. I saw many colleagues, who seems to be in a golden cage - well paid but without a perspective or meaningful purpose (at least that was the way I saw it).\nI hope now you got a goal and idea that motivates you to reach the sky! I have just made a few steps to search for it.', a user said: 'Glad to hear that!\nI've made my goal to help people. Find the best way I can and do a lot of it. It's simple, it's not specific, but I love it ❤️'",
        "In response to 'I got caught in this loop for a very long time. I’m almost embarrassed at the sheer irony of me even saying this with the work attitude I’ve had for such a long time: I’m happiest when I’m proud of contributions I make at work.', a user said: 'Yes!\nIt's fine to not like your job. It's important to not let people abuse you.\nBut doing the best you can with anything you have your hands on is the shortest way to feel alive.'",
        "In response to 'Thanks for sharing your story.\nI now realise that the same happened to me. Solved it over time but still felt guilty over it till... reading your message.\nThank you!', a user said: 'It's a natural reaction. It happens!\nYou're alright 🔥'",
        "In response to 'More people need to read this.', a user said: '🙏 I’m glad it was useful!'",
        "In response to 'well no shit. you are engineer. quiet quitting is for people who have shitty jobs that teach them nothing and pay them little to nothing too. engineer should work hard and learn as much as he can and job hop.', a user said: 'I've always found things to learn in every situation. Often when people around me couldn't.\nMaybe some jobs are the exception but I haven't seen one yet.'",
        "In response to 'well ... you can learn stuff even when working as cashier in Mcdonalds but like..\nI prefer to learn high quality knowledge that common people can't easily learn. if job gives someone chances and opportunities to learn high quality knowledge and they decide to do some quiet quitting, it likely will bring more harm than good.', a user said: '100% with you on that – always take the best opportunity possible.\nMy point is – when there are no options, a good attitude nets you more out of the situation. Always.\n(but keep out of that situation if possible of course)'"
