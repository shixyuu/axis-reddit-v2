        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'This season has been interesting. Seems like Robyn is more present this season but I suspect itâ€™s because she had no choice. After what happened with Garrison Iâ€™m sure she panicked and said we have to do something to not look bad. Hence the scenes weâ€™ve gotten like her telling Kody go be with your other kids. Only problem is her acting and credibility is so far down the drain she has absolutely no credibility or sympathy.'",
        "In response to 'Wasnâ€™t this whole season filmed before Garrison passed?', a user said: 'Majority of it was but some super slithers here figured out some scenes notably Kody and Robynâ€™s driveway scene wasnâ€™t. The clothes Kody was wearing wasnâ€™t released by the company that made them until after Garrison. Quite impressive how far some sluthes here go lol.'"
