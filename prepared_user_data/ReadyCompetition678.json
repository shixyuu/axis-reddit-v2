        "In response to 'I’ve done this at every job I’ve ever had except my very first one. I worked so damn hard at kfc in high school and got rewarded with more work - and being assigned the tasks that sucked the most. I also got paid less than new hires who were over 18 because I was still a minor. I learned fast that slacking off rewards you with fewer duties and the same money. I almost never work after 2:30 now unless I’m excited about an upcoming lesson and actually want to prep for it.', a user said: 'This is so true. People who go “above and beyond” are given extra things to do. People who do not are not given extra, or even have responsibilities taken away, because they don’t do a good enough job. So, be a “slacker” and you get less work? Yes. I am in!! Lol'"
