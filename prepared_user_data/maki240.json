        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I quiet quit after my manager pushed me to apply for a senior role. They had no other applicants but still said I wasn’t the right fit. They made me upskill my position but was always delaying the pay rise. Always a new excuse with them.\nWorking from home made quiet quitting so much easier because I did what was required of me and nothing more.\nAfter finding out I got a new role that pays double the rate of my old job, I “unfortunately” contracted COVID for a week then took 2 weeks of annual leave. Those two weeks were also my two weeks notice.'"
