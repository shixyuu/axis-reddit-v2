All my work is about 75% completed. Hard to make an issue of that right? I've had two promotions in the last two years.\nRemember, your relationship with your employer is an adversarial one. You compete against them to extract as much as possible from them for as little effort as possible. Cut corners, come in late, leave early, miss that deadline but do just enough that they can't get rid of you.\nMy boss is always slightly angry with me for my attitude and output. I don't do overtime and I don't work on weekends. I just had another pay rise.'"
