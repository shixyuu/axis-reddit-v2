        "In response to 'I feel like I missed it. I had watched until around season 11/12 then restarted at the second to last season when Christine had left and Janelle and Meri were working on leaving. I just missed why we all dislike Robyn so much. I went back to catch up and even in season 12 Christine is crediting Robyn for her relationship with Kody getting better.\nShe seems to be genuinely devastated by the events in the family. She said from the beginning that she was marrying Kody because of the situation with the other wives. I feel bad for all of them that this is how it’s turned out.', a user said: 'She is someone who says all the right things, but her actions never match her words. She wants the one big family, but uses their money to hire a nanny instead of sharing childcare responsibilities. She wants Kodi to have good relationships but monopolizes his time and encourages him to keep secrets from the very beginning. She wants to be close with her sister wives but never calls, texts, or visits Meri. It just doesn't add up.'"
