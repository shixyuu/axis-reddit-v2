        "In response to 'This is neither of the employees problem. If someone isn't working it's a management problem alone. You can't be an effective manager and afraid of confrontation.', a user said: 'Yes it’s managers job to manage, but it doesn’t take from the fact that as a “friend” you aren’t going to cause harm to your friends. They are well aware that their lack of giving a fuck or their burnout or whatever means they aren’t doing their job and therefore other people at their level have to pick up the slack. They need to be cognizant of that. They know their workload didn’t just disappear, it still has to get done. They are being copied on emails to both of them when he knows it’s just him, so he’s well aware it’s affecting his “friend” too and that’s not right. Yes its the managers fault but OP should reevaluate the value of the word “friend” in the workplace when it’s causing him a hardship that nobody seems to care about.'"
