        "In response to 'I get hung up here:\nOn average, psilocybin users clocked about 3.60 minutes less of overtime per week.\n3.6 minutes out of an assumed 40 hour, 2400 minute week. Then they conflate it against everyone to blow up that number. 3.6 minutes feels in the noise, tbh.', a user said: 'It's a difference of 0.15%. That's just not significant at all.\n\"One major caveat of the study is the correlational nature of its findings,” Korman explained. “This means that we cannot know whether employees’ use of psilocybin lead to their reduced overtime hours worked.\"\nStraight from the horses mouth. This entire study is pointless, they can't even attribute the cause of the 0.15% discrepancy. What a waste of time.'"
