        "In response to 'I agree, I don't like the phrase.\nI'm a manager. I wouldn't expect my employees to do dozens of extra hours a week, check their email outside of hours or forgo their holiday entitlement. All I expect is during working hours, they complete the expected amount of work to a high quality.\nHaving worked with Scandinavians, this has always been their ethic - how can I do my job in the shortest time period possible, so I can go home and have quality time with my family. Whereas in London and probably more common with Americans, the culture is more like can I be seen to be logging on at 7am, and still replying at 8pm? Never mind the fact you've had 8 coffee breaks and spent an hour chatting to someone in a different department.', a user said: 'I'm with the Scandinavians. I work from home and have established a routine that means I get all my work done and to the expected standards in about 4-5hrs instead of using up the full 8hr working day so I can plan activities with my kids in the afternoons. I had a previous job which saw me doing the work of 2-3 staff members all the while they were hiring new staff of the same grade as myself for more pay and giving them the holidays off and allowing them to fob off work which would then be passed to me to do. I just stopped turning up once I worked the notice period I had given them and not the notice period they expected me to work.  No way am I doing more work than my wage is entitled to agai .'"
