        "In response to 'Original Post: How many of you have \"quiet quit\" and when did it start for you? I got to say for me I quiet quit my last job 5-6 years into it after realizing I didn't have a future with that company, but I never left because I was at least getting paid and now have a decent savings account because of it. I legit started my new job early this year and I've already quiet quitted. I hardly do the bare minimum since I gave them a whole summer of hard work and not a single fucking praise. Or even any kind of \"hey keep it up you've been doing an awesome job\". The moment I make a mistake I feel like it destroys everything i worked hard for so what's the point anymore? I'm just going to keep working enough so I don't get fired, but if I do I doubt I'll be upset over it. It also just seems the way 2023 has went if the economy and housing market continues to stay awful next year I can already see people quiet quitting for 2024 and it hasn't even started yet!', a user said: 'Never truly did the \"quiet quit\" until this year at 33 years of age. It finally clicked for me after thinking I found the field I want to be working in, and then experiencing the same office politics and toxicity  happening all over again. I went too hard in the first 6 months, now all hard work got me was more work I can't keep up with, and the boss is actively letting me drown and fail,  but won't let me go because I actually can do the job properly, and 5 senior people have left already within 2 years.\nNow I go in and do what I can do in my day, no above and beyond, no overtime, no special requests, nothing. \nIf something doesn't get done, it really doesn't matter, it's all fake deadlines and no real emergencies, it's freaking paperwork, not someone getting heart surgery.'"
