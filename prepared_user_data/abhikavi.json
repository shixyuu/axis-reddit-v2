        "In response to 'I started my career in 2006, right before the last recession. Back then, it was “Just be glad you HAVE a job.” It didn’t matter if you were complaining about a legitimately abusive situation—just be glad.\nThen for like 5-10 years after, I saw dozens of coworkers get the old, “We’re giving you a promotion! You get a new title and more responsibility. Unfortunately, we can’t get you more money… yet.” They would string people along for a year or two, not paying them what the role was worth. Saving a lot of money stealing from employees.\nSo yeah, “quiet quitting” sounds an awful lot like corporate boot licking propaganda. Wage theft is the most common and proportionally largest form of theft. And I have seen zero repercussions over the last 16 years for any of it.\nAdvocate for yourself, take ALL your time off, job hop until you make what the role is worth and fuck em.', a user said: '“quiet quitting” sounds an awful lot like corporate boot licking propaganda.\nThis phrase is new to me as of about five minutes ago, so my associations with it are limited to what's in this thread.\nTo be honest, I kinda like it?\nI quiet quit at the start of the pandemic and my life has been much less stressful since. I'm a huge fan of not doing extra unpaid work. And funny enough, no one's even said anything negative to me about it, so it's not even had downsides. 10/10, I'm planning to quiet quit for the rest of my life.\nI don't understand why it's supposed to be a bad thing.\nCan we just, as workers, take this phrase and use it as a positive? Encourage others to quiet quit, talk about how nice quiet quitting has been, etc? (Or, could someone explain some context here I'm missing about why this is inherently a negative phrase?)'",
        "In response to 'The issue with it, to me, is that they’re saying meeting the requirements of your job is akin to not doing your job at all.\nIt’s not quitting to do just what needs to be done without going above and beyond. Or to have healthy boundaries between work and life. The word “quitting” has no business being assigned to real people doing real labor.\nIt reminds me of those sayings like, “If you’re not 15 minutes early, you’re late,” or “I need you to give 110%.” They’re manipulative ways of making people feel like meeting expectations is already failure.\n“Quiet quitting” describes a very healthy, admirable worker behavior in terms of how the employer sees it—that they’re being robbed of something. When in reality, people are just not playing these stupid games anymore. But the language is cleverly designed to set the bar in favor of the employer, and make anything less than above-and-beyond sound like not good enough.', a user said: 'Thank you for explaining that.\nDo you have any suggestions for a more positive way to describe this action?'"
