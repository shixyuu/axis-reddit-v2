        "In response to 'They will get shit on for it.\nI remember when I first entered the workplace, and noticed how inflation was outpacing my raises...and every adult I talked to insulted me, and said I should just \"look for another job, if you can't pay your bills.\"\nOkay...now, 10 years and 6 jobs later, I'm finally making decent money...and those same adults now call me a \"disloyal job hopper,\" and \"the reason the economy is in shambles.\"\nThey tell you to stop trying to change the system, and just look out for yourself...then they insult you for taking their advice.', a user said: 'I’m in the same boat. 12 years and 6 jobs. Moved for promotions in responsibility and pay every time.\nWhen I left my last job, my old boss was pissed! I told him I was leaving, I was getting paid more than what they were willing to pay, and a new title they weren’t willing to give me. He called me a lot of names but “a disloyal snake” was a frequent one. Told me I better be happy there because nobody would ever hire me again after job jumping so much. I’m ruining my career if I leave.\nWhen he hired me he told I needed to change jobs from my current role and do what’s right for me and my family. “Don’t worry about the job jumping because you’re doing what’s right for you.”\nThe smiles and handshakes certainly turned when I gave him my 2 weeks.'"
