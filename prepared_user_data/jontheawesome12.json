        "In response to 'In retail, \"Quiet Firing\" happens all the time. You don't like the employee for whatever reason, you just schedule them little to no hours until they leave. I've seen it happen so many times.', a user said: 'This is so common it’s criminal. It’s an easy way to drive an employee out without needing to fire them and deal with the legal qualifications of such an action. Meaning it could be race, gender, or age driven. But nothing can be done because they made you quit.'"
