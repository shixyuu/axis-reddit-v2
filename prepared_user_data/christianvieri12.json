        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting got me a bonus and a 15% raise I work from home and stopped trying about a year ago. I do monthly closing entries (10 hours of work), but other than that, I hardly do anything. I take my time responding to emails, decline meetings I don't have to join, etc. Since we were acquired and there's been turnover in management, my boss doesn't know what my job involves, and is also weirdly-averse to delegation (workaholic type), so I don't get assigned to anything.  Since I'm just chilling all day with my dog, I'm holding out here until they replace me or until kids come along, maybe in another year.\nWell my boss called me up today to tell me I'm doing a \"great job\". We exceeded targets, so I'm getting 2x my bonus (20k, target was 10k), and a 15% raise (100k to 115k).  Que sera, sera..', a user said: 'Your manager sounds great. Head of the accounting function at my work emails me to say â€˜can you email person x to ask them xyzâ€™. Then ccs said person into the email. Sheâ€™s an absolute goon.'",
        "In response to 'My boss just literally sent me an email a couple days ago asking me to email someone a certain question. I sent the email copying him on it and wording it the way he asked. Apparently the question wasn't good enough to get the answer he wanted, so he replied to the email clarifying the question to get the right answer. So that's five emails to get an answer that would have taken two emails had he just asked the question directly while copying me on it...smh', a user said: 'I just copy and paste the email into a new email and cc the manager in ðŸ˜‚ itâ€™s a very strange interaction'"
