        "In response to 'I was a supervisor at an automotive plant where the quota production goal increased almost every quarter. This was because some of the try-hard supervisors would continue to run the machines through prescribed break and lunch times, without any positive incentive other than to be \"that guy who never stops working,\" and reach 108%-110% of their quota. I had several arguments with them, which eventually turned into shouting matches, about how eventually quota is going to become unobtainable and its going to be their fault.\nOf course, I was an idiot for thinking this. I quit there a while back and goals were already getting unobtainable in multiple areas and the company was having processes that needed 2 people to maintain quality control and efficiency worked by a single person.\nThere were tons of quality mistakes, but of course that was the lowly production line workers fault and not management stretching them too thin. Oh, and unionizing was actively discouraged and we were told \"corporate will pull out of this location\" if we tried.', a user said: 'In Upton Sinclair's The Jungle they call this \"speeding up\" where they would hire a try-hard that could work faster than anyone else and would be put in place as the model for everyone else and if you fell behind in production, you would be replaced by the many thousands of job seekers roaming the streets. The protagonist is an 18 year old who ruins his body within 3 years. Written in 1906'"
