        "In response to 'Yeah it's crazy. My friend's daughter is 17 and has a level 2 childcare qualification. She works in a local day nursery and gets paid £4.81 an hour. She's a lot better at that kind of job than I'd ever be yet I'd earn £9.50 per hour for the same job. It isn't fair. The minimum wage should apply to everyone over 16 at the same rate and then higher pay should be based on qualifications and experience.', a user said: 'Fucking hell. I work as a waiter at a hotel. My job is somewhat basic but can be stressful, challenging at times but Childcare is something I view as needing a higher wage because they are responsible for children. At least a tenner per hour regardless of age.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Having to read about \"Quiet Quitting\" instead of the long-established \"Work to Rule\". And of course it's on TikTok.\nQuiet quitting: The workplace trend taking over TikTok - BBC News\nKids today need to learn more about unions and industrial action.!', a user said: 'So, basically do the bare basic then. Oh, how awful of them to have to work 9-5 whilst muppets like me are on zero hour contracts and NMW and are deemed expendable by the company. I could literally be fired and replaced if the company wanted to. I hate zero hour contracts.\n​\nIf you want to quit, just fucking quit. I'm just a bit bitter about 9-5 office jobs being pushed as if it's the only industry to exist. I doubt Waiters can quietly quit.'"
