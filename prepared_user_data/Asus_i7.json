        "In response to 'Its weird because if these are misdemeanors (which reckless and speed contest are), they're jury trial cases, which means the judge doesn't convict or acquit, the jury does.\nI'm gonna be honest, this level of knowledge should be something any cop more than a year or so should know simply because they have testified in front of a jury.  Which makes me question if these cops are real or imagined.  If they are real, it gives me serious questions about SFPDs knowledge and training by the standards of the average cop.', a user said: 'The judge can always dismiss a case before it goes to trial. The judge can also enter a \"Judgment notwithstanding verdict\" [1] and enter a \"Not Guilty\" verdict, overruling a jury that voted \"Guilty.\"\nSource:\n[1]\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_notwithstanding_verdict'"
