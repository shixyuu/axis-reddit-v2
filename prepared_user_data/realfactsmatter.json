        "In response to 'We’re mostly extroverts.\nI LOATHED working from home. It was a complete and total nightmare! No faces all day; only initials pulsating on a computer screen.\nYes, I missed my coworkers. I also missed the in-person interactions during meetings (after which I do go back to my desk to complete the task alone; I’m not a through-and-through extrovert) and being able to pop my head in to have conversations with my colleagues.\nI can’t even do headphones! For me, that and WFH feels disengaging and the opposite of motivation. My performance tanked when I had to WFH, my mental health suffered greatly, and I was ecstatic to return to the office. After that, my performance skyrocketed. But I am not knocking those who feel or work differently at all! I’m only saying that there is a very broad spectrum of what works best for each individual.', a user said: 'This feels like it was written by the HR Lady who's been asked to convince other employees to return to the office by management. It reeks of corporate.'"
