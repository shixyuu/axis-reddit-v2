        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting life I am quiet quitting life and nobody realizes thatâ€™s what it is. My friends think Iâ€™m just being a bad friend. My family just thinks Iâ€™m being a bad family member. I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to live in the world any more. I just want to go to work and then come home and thatâ€™s it. I donâ€™t want to go have dinner with people anymore. I donâ€™t want to hang out and be made to feel obligated to stay until 11 pm before I can go home.  Nobody realizes that this is my way letting go of life, of escaping from the world.  Iâ€™m alone, Iâ€™m 30 years old and havenâ€™t had an intimate partner for a decade. I love those in my life tremendously. But I just want to let go. When Iâ€™m home, Iâ€™m free to be who I want. To feel how I want, to look how I want. I can say what I want, my cat doesnâ€™t mind. He doesnâ€™t judge. He looks up to me and needs me and heâ€™s the only thing thatâ€™s warm in my bed.  Thereâ€™s nothing more signifÃ­cate to write here. Just thank you for listening.', a user said: 'I can relate so much... holding the mask up is exhausting. Jim Carrey once said: depression tells you that you need a deep rest from the role you are playing. \nMaybe try to do so and don't go out for dinner. I know it's hard, but this is what I try recently, to say yes to myself. If I want to spent a week only with me than I try to allow it my self. Some people will not understand and don't want to understand and I think this is the hardest part. \nSending you a big hug, you are not alone with this ðŸ©·'"
