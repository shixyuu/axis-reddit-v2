        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting: why doing the bare minimum at work has gone global | Work & careers [External Link]: https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/06/quiet-quitting-why-doing-the-bare-minimum-at-work-has-gone-global', a user said: 'Phrases like this are invented to make it seem like poor pay leading to extremely low worker morale is a new phenomenon.\nIn reality we even see monkeys refuse to do things in experiments because they aren't being \"paid\"  fairly. Its an inherent part of our advanced intelligence - we know we are being treated extremely unfairly. When humans are able they will adjust effort in accordance with their pay.\nWhy put in effort when another monkey gets all the bananas for doing nothing?'"
