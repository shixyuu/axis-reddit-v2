        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'I've had a job where I was at the company 3 years and the majority of the other people in my department had been there a year. I was handling a lot and more work/projects got put on my plate. The newer people were trained enough to take on a few of those so that the work distribution would have been more even. I wish then I had quiet quit.\nSo yeah, when it's a matter of preserving work distribution balance, I'm all for it.'"
