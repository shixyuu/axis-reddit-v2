        "In response to 'just to be clear, by 'quiet-quit' we mean people who stopped doing unpaid overtime or extra work and just scaled down to their contracted work/hours?', a user said: 'What the academic world calls “work to rule” the mass media has spun as a horrific negative thing called “quiet quitting”.\nYes. They mean doing exactly what’s in your contract … because god forbid we get a fair exchange as an employee'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting, how many people are actually doing this ? I keep hearing this term, just wonder if people are actually doing it.', a user said: 'This is a bs buzz term being used by business, media, and social media.\nThere is a formal term for this in industrial relations. It’s a form of covert conflict known as ‘work to rule’. As time goes on people are more educated and don’t accept unfair trade offs. The digital nature of society has also exposed the lie that “you should be grateful you have a job at all” (if you have desirable skills you can get a new job quickly).\nTo answer your question - i’m not actively doing it, but I am operating to the terms of my employment contract. If they want more I expect to be appropriately compensated'",
        "In response to 'work to rule\nQuiet quitters are under-performers, typically underperforming enough to be a problem, but not outwardly enough to bother with formal HR processes. Most quiet quitters are going to end up having suitability conversations to nudge them towards another role, or otherwise end up on performance management pathways. It's typically a motivational issue.\nWorking to rule, typically used in relation to industrial action, is a form of protest where you refuse to do activities that are typical of your work, but not explicitly required in your job description or prpcess responsibilities. The impact on productivity is much more pronounced. You could extend this sentiment (of protest and refusal to do tasks that are not formally documented in the role description) to an everyday situation, but it's likely to quickly result in performance management without the framework protections resulting as part of planned industrial action.\nFinally, there's doing your job, which is not work to rule, nor quiet quitting. This involves doing your job in the allocated time, within a satisfactory band of productivity/performance. This sounds like what you are describing.', a user said: 'That’s not been the definition of quiet quitting that has been publicly spread. The crux of it is “not doing what you’re not paid for” (doing the bare minimum of your iob requirements). The employer argues it’s not going above and beyond, and only doing the bare minimum. The employee argues they’re doing what they’re paid to do, and only what they are paid to do.\nWork to rule is defined as industrial action where employees do the minimum they are required to do in their employment contract. Employers consider it the bare minimum, employees consider it doing what they’re paid to do, and only what they’re laid to do.\nBoth quiet quitting and work to rule can be subject to the exact same performance management processes. In all honesty you’ve said what I’ve said… (and said again here) just using different words.\nTangibly they are the same and result in the same outcomes. Reduced productivity, output, and efficiency and are detrimental to a unitarist or pluralist social structure (assuming we’re talking about the ‘west’).\nAs an example - my employment contract stipulates my working hours are 38/wk. i do no overtime, and do not take overtime when offered. I work exactly 38 hours and leave (do mot stay back, do not come in early). I take my breaks when scheduled and don’t work through them to help during busy periods. Am I quiet quitting, working to rule, or am I doing my job?\nThe answer ultimately depends on the perception of the person looking at my actions, but it could be seen as industrial action, quiet quitting, or doing my job no matter what way you look at it.'",

The fact that you're doing it for an employer and not a paying customer or client does not give flexibility on the actions being performed.\nI'm not sure how much more simple I can make this or compare it to, it may just be an 'agree to disagree'. You're welcome to google the terms and explore the corporate powerpoints, and the definitions. I'm happy to give you multiple:\ndoing the tasks involved with your assigned role at work, no more, no less; doing your job without your job taking over your entire life.\nWorkers only do the minimum work required by their supervisors. They give more priority to life outside of work than to promotion and fame and do not want to focus all of their lives at work.\nDoing the minimum requirements of one's job and putting in no more time, effort, or enthusiasm than absolutely necessary.\nAll 3 of those are definitions provided for Quiet Quitting. See how they all align with \"doing the the bare minimum of your duties\" which is 'doing exactly what your job says, no more no less'? There are ops roles that do not have the opportunity to WFH to manipulate it the way you're stating. Doing 'only the bare minimum' but doing the job is still considered quiet quitting in these roles.\nThere is no definitive difference between quiet quitting, work to rule, and doing your job, other than the perception of the person who is making the statement.\nIn my personal opinion if you are academically inclined you will use the term work to rule. If you have extensive experience in the workforce (but no academic background) it will be 'doing your job'. If you are Gen Z or new to the workforce (or heavily into social media) it will be quiet quitting. They are all the same thing. Unfortunately how people perceive it changes greatly depending on the terminology you opt for.'"
