[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/02qwb6ziqvi91.jpg', a user said: 'It is the employer’s responsibility to adequately staff, compensate, and delegate.\nThis is way it should be looked at. Refusing to backfill positions and putting strain on a team is quiet-staffing. Freezes on pay increases is quiet-compensating. Requiring people to perform duties outside of their contracted roles is quiet-management. This should be the corporate conversation.'"
