        "In response to 'I think I'm in the same boat, but I'm not seeing a good way out. What advice do you have on finding jobs with smaller businesses?\nIt might be the field I work in (logistics), but it seems like any small business either is never hiring or hiring for a low paying customer service position. The only jobs I see with significant pay are at large companies, too far to commute (2+ hours one way) or too demanding (45+ hours per week minimum). Or even both.', a user said: 'I would recommend looking for a business park like area with shipping docks and then look at their logos or the directory for possible employers. Many small businesses donâ€™t have themselves advertised like that but you can research and call the companies or strike up a convo with the shipping area folks. (This may be region specific, prob works best for suburbs outside bigger cities)'"
