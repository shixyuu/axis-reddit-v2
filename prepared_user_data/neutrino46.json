        "In response to 'stop donating!\nI agree! I stopped long ago.\nI say stop volunteering or giving your time as the quickest way to make an impact since this is immediate. A lack of willing volunteers to provide free labor would crush the Jehovah's Witness organization. A lack of volunteers (especially males) is kryptonite for JWs as they would not be able to operate congregations.\nI believe that even if 100% of donations stopped tomorrow.....the Watchtower Corporations have a large enough war chest of funds to keep things running for years.\nBut at some point....an organization with no people working.....is no longer an organization.', a user said: 'I haven't donated since I was baptized.'"
