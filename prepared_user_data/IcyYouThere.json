        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I’ve worked plenty with lazy workers while I always put 100% and more into my work. Yet when COVID hit I was asked to put in even more work, go above and beyond, take my work home with me. Still, I did it all, as fast and efficient as I could because I seek optimization in life. Yet, as inflation affects us, burnout, and cut backs occur I’m realizing I’m worth more. I’ve been seeking other opportunities while still committing myself to work but not going above and beyond. My mental health & last relationship had been affected severely from overworking.\nNow, the economy is cooling down, they say I can relax for once. Well, too little too late, I have multiple job interviews lined up next week and will absolutely move on. No, I have not been quietly quitting but yes I’m fed up. There are lazy workers out there but there are just as many lazy higher ups who neglect their workers. Not fair to blame people for not wanting to work until they get daily headaches or until their backs break. Common decency would be to offer solutions when someone says they need a break.\nQuick rant\nPersonally in my position it’s hard for me to take vacations due to responsibility of my work. Funny how no one else knows how to do it. Haha, well it’s not funny, it’s because people are poorly trained and lazy people do not want to learn new things. Poor workers lead to bad work just as much as poor managers lead to terrible working conditions. All’s fair in love and war, & work has become a war front. Amen'"
