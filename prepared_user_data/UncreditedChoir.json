        "Quietly quitting When I first heard the term 'quiet quitting' I needed to understand more of what that meant. Now that I know, I think that's me right now.\nI've been working the same job for 10 years at a major global electronics company, a name all of you would know instantly. It's a good job, it pays well, it's low stress with great benefits. I am good at what I do and my co workers are cool.\nAnd I don't give a fuck anymore.\nI stopped trying to advance. I stopped going the extra mile. I stopped being the one offering input at the weekly meetings. It just doesn't get me anywhere after all these promises of working your way up the ladder.\nI realized I hit a peak a few years ago and no matter what I do, or how hard I work, it doesn't matter. Upper management are mostly ambitious borderline sociopath MBA career climbers who are all young enough to be my children. They all give a creepy vibe almost like a politician who acts like they care about you, then they talk shit behind your back.\nSo I still do my job but I do the minimum amount required not to be noticed. I don't report errors on our website, I don't correct people when they are wrong. I just don't, period. The biggest thing that put a target on your back here is attendance, like even clocking in 1 minute late gets you on the tardy report that goes out once a week but I never have a problem with that, and quite honestly it blows me away how many co-workers just can't seem to get here on time because we aren't in a giant metropolis with lots of traffic. Usually the younger co-workers are the late one.\nI am in my early 50s and I've spoken with my immediate supervisor who is two years older than me about this, and we're both in agreement that we're too old and lazy to want to start over, so we'll just coast here as long as we can.\nAnyone else feeling this?",
        "In response to 'I'm in Cali, I'll meet you guys after I hit club. Pre-rolls all around. We will start a big smoke out', a user said: 'I usually take small edible doses about 1-2 days a week at work, just enough to take the edge off. Nothing more than 5mg. Took 10 by mistake once, that was interesting.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'you are awesome, let's ditch work and smoke a preroll'",
        "In response to '<image>\nQuiet quitting started in 1999.', a user said: 'This is the way, children. Once you stop caring, everything falls into place.'",
        "In response to 'I quiet retired.  I’m one of those MBA guys.  I left a good 6-figure salary corporate career job because I just could t take it anymore. After my husband died, I didn’t care anymore; it didn’t matter to me. Career was so unimportant anymore. So I stopped caring, got offered severance and took it. Never want to go back. I soft retired. I got a job at a doggie day care and am happier than I’ve been in awhile. I play with dogs all day making enough to meet my minimal expenses.', a user said: 'That is great to hear, sorry about your husband.'",
        "In response to 'Amen. I've hit my peak possible position without having to join \"leadership\". Not interested in the slightest in joining that lot.\nLearned long ago that no matter how much extra you do, you're still going to be 3/5 on the annual review and get the same 3% raise that everyone gets across the board.\nSo I do my tasks and clock out. And don't think about any of it until the next morning. I'm cruising all the way until I can draw SS.', a user said: 'I keep getting told I would need to move to the state where the company is headquartered for more opportunities but I am fucking not moving to a boring flat cold state in the midwest that starts with the letter 'I', because to me they are all the same really!  I grew up in one of them, so I can say that.'",
        "In response to 'I know of literally no one who has ever gotten a 4/5 or 5/5.  Word came down from on high that no one rates above a 3, ever.\nAnd I did a 3+ month stint last year, covering a 3 person team's work by myself. One went on maternity leave and the other took FMLA time for something else at the exact same time.\nI kept that project afloat, alone, for an entire quarter of the year.\n3/5...', a user said: 'Same. Our annual review has 4 category types, and absolutely fucking no one who has a semblance of a real life outside this job will hit the top mark, ever.\nDangle that carrot further, pricks.'",
        "In response to 'The youngs at work have made it EXTREMELY clear that they don't care about anybody's input if you're over 40. We are the enemy as far as they are concerned. Fine, make stupid, expensive mistakes because you don't want to listen to the olds tell about the four other times we tried the same thing. Don't care anymore, I guess they they can figure it out for themselves. Or not. Whatever.', a user said: 'I see that with a lot of engineers in my company. Most are fresh out of college and their turnover rate is pretty high. Most last 2-3 years and they're off to the next gig. The OG engineers as I call them have been here for 30 years and they know their shit.'",
        "In response to 'How childish, a tardy list?\nWho comes up with this shit?', a user said: 'Bored middle manager dickwads who do nothing but have meetings with other bored middle manager dickwads.'",
        "In response to 'How childish, a tardy list?\nWho comes up with this shit?', a user said: 'It used to be worse, we had a 'points' system every quarter. If you were late by X minutes, you accrued X number of points. If you missed a day being sick and didn't have any PTO left, you got X number of points.  Yeah, stupid right?\nI saw people lose their jobs solely based on getting too many points that had absolutely nothing to do with their overall job performance.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Respect the Red Swingline Stapler'",
        "In response to '>It just doesn't get me anywhere after all these promises of working your way up the ladder.\nI used to think companies/management/corporate are just stupid. I mean, they’d get so much more out of their workers if they’d just fulfill the promises, if they’d just treat people like human fucking beings.\nNow I don’t know. I mean, they might be stupid, but i think there’s more to it. Some kind of weird power trip. Some kind of disrespect, some kind of “we only actually need you for this, we are the kings, fuck off and just grind away and make us money.”\nWhich is still stupid to me. Because they could probably make more money if they let people shine. But it’s like they just can’t stand that. It’s like them getting the feeling that they are better than you, even if they are not and are only dumbass greedy assholes, is more important to them.\nIt’s a dumb way to run a business, I don’t care how successful it is.', a user said: 'What I have learned after working for 30 years at everything from bars and nightclubs to retail to tech is that the formula is the fucking same no matter where you work.'"
