The teams struggle a bit, but it's completed just in the nick of time.\nThe next year X is increased again. The teams start working longer, skipping breaks, but for whatever reason at no point to do they push back, they almost become martyrs, being proud that they've worked to exhaustion, looking down at peers who took their lunches and so on. With the additional hours they've worked they just about manage it.\nThe business doesn't necessarily know about this struggle, all they see is that the target was met again. Guess what happens the next year?', a user said: 'This seems to be something a lot of people don't grasp.\nWhen I've had this situation come up in the past, I will make a point of doing the exact same amount of work I did previously.\nI will not pull extra hours, I will not run around like a blue arse fly, and I will not take on unnecessary stress - and I will ensure my colleagues do the same.\nWhen management notices deliverables aren't being hit, I can make a point that there isn't enough staff.\nPeople don't seem to get that if you pull out all the stops and get it done, that now becomes the standard and you're just making life harder for yourself.'"
