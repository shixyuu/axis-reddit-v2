        "In response to 'Nowhere did I say only OE people do this? I just know for sure this guy was and the ride it out advise is posted here every damn day, so plenty of OE people do', a user said: 'I work for a fully remote company. The full time employee who got fired and got replaced by me on contract was so inattentive to his work and was gone many hours at a time, that I thought the\nonly\nreasons why was that he had very bad ADHD, or (after I found this sub), he was possibly working other jobs, possibly in person rather than remote for how bad he was with response times.\nMany of the other employees work only on what they're assigned to do, never above and beyond. I had intern energy, I wanted to contribute much more and felt like I had higher level ideas. Their full time offer was not a raise compared to contract rate. It was a big bummer. Now I do just what I'm asked and pitch ideas here and there, but now that I'm thinking of OE, I wonder if other employees are doing the same thing, just that no one thought so because they do exactly what they're told.\nTowards the end of my coworker's time, his level of competence didn't feel like quiet quitting, it simply was that he was\nthat bad\nlol. OE or not, it sucks to work with people like that. So I sorta get it. But I also think it doesn't necessarily mean OE either.'"
