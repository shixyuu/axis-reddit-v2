        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I'm in the same spot as your friend. Was told it was a temporary thing just for the holidays. That was 2 years ago. Kept being told \"As soon as a team lead spot opens up you're first in line\". One of my former coaches said the schedule has 160 hours of TL time available but our 3 TLs were only using about 120. So there should've been room for another one. He said he'd look into it but nothing ever came of it and he ended up quitting.\nI got a job interview at another company tomorrow. I'm burned out on being treated like shit by customers and having all this crap piled on me and I'm not even paid my worth. I'm at the point where I don't think I'd even want the promotion if it was offered. Dealing with this bullshit plus more I don't even have to handle yet, and I never get a break from it? No thanks.'"
