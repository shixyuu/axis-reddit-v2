        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I feel you dude. Spent some time selling to smb with monthly quotas and it was exhausting. Starting back at zero every single month, having to put a lot of emphasis on activities/metrics,and falling really far behind when you take time off was rough.\nI’ve been out of that role for a few years now, but I still feel the impact of it mentally. I still haven’t been able to fully rewire my mind and I have a hard time not being comfortable with days where my productivity is low.'"
