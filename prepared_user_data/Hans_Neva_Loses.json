        "In response to 'I resent the term \"quiet quitting\", as a person who is protective of their time outside office hours. This doesn't make me a bad employee, it makes me a better one. I'm very good at my job, and am able to do it better than some in fewer hours, and I don't suffer from burn out because I make sure I get time to switch off. Measure my performance on the work I do, not the time I'm available.\nThis term really is corporations responding to the mass realisation that they can't bully and trick 1 person into doing 2 people's jobs any more.', a user said: 'Exactly. I look at people I work with who consistently work 1-1:30 over when I leave as not having good time management. I guess they view it as the exact opposite.'"
