I was really confused for a while when I first read about it. How is it anything to do with \"quitting\"??\nI haven't worked a single minute of (voluntary) overtime in my current job for the last 6.5 years, and I have no intentions of changing that. I grudge every second I spend working past finishing time, fuck that.'"
