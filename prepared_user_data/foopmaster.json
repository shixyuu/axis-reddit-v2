        "In response to 'I’m not gonna lie, I get a hard on every time I hear or see a post about this worker’s revolution, but I feel so stupid that I let people walk all over me in my early 20’s. I am 200% for this movement. You gotta get yours, nobody else is going to give it to you. I got paid $10 an hour at Lowe’s for five years while I slung bricks and concrete around all day while cashiers got paid $15 to stand. We should’ve been both paid $40/hour.', a user said: 'After the crash of 2008 I saw firsthand how deeply and quickly worker’s right were eroded. Many jobs were cut and benefits slashed at that time, and many employees that had worked for companies since they were in high school were fired and new employees hired at much lower pay. That was the time I remember“unskilled labor” becoming a more popular phrase to describe jobs that people made a nice living from 20-30 years before.'"
