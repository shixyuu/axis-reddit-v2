The more you and others continue to keep overworking to keep up with a high volume of work, the worse things will get. Managers can not open a new position if there's not a business reason to do so. When the work continues to get done, even if that means overworking people, it will not result in change because things are getting done.\nBusiness is largely about status quo. If things are working and getting done changes will not be made. If things fall apart changes will be made. Do with that what you will.', a user said: 'All of this!!'"
