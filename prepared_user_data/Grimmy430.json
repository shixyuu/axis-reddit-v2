        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'My husband took a two week vacation to vietnam to see his homeland. I was ok with it. I took care of our 6yr and 3yr olds alone for two weeks. When he got home I specifically said I was so tired to making and planning dinners. The next day (I worked, he did not) I asked him what was for dinner and he told me he hadn’t thought about it because he needed to take the day to relax from all the travel the day prior. Excuse me what? I lost my shit on him. Told him how I was pissed, he was absolutely disrespectful and selfish, and showed me how much he did not respect or even think about me. He’s been planning dinner most nights since. I quit loudly. It’s all good now tho.'"
