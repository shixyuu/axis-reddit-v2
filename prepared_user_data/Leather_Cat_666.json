        "In response to 'Original Post: ‘This has to stop’: A young man on TikTok says he and his wife make $120K/year — but can only afford this run-down house. Why Gen Z, millennials are using 'quiet quitting' to cope [External Link]: https://moneywise.com/real-estate/real-estate/young-man-quiet-quitting-cope', a user said: 'My boomer parents recently bought a new car and my mother said verbatim “the car costs as much as a house!”\nThey bought their home for $100k in 1990 in California and have never moved. I’ve explained time and time again to them both why their world view on work and money is broken but they simply cannot hear it.\nAs a millennial in a two income household both with degrees and “good jobs” there’s no realistic way we’ll ever own a home in our state near our jobs and it’s exhausting dealing with the cognitive dissonance of older generations.\nIn short, I hate it here.'",
        "In response to 'That was the main reason I left California. I could not afford the rent or a mortgage.', a user said: 'If my career did not require me to be in/near a HCOL I would pack my family up.\nAllI I want is a 2B/1BA with a decent school district and that’s a dream out of reach. It’s soul crushing to know I’ve done more to better myself, worked my ass off and still cannot afford something my parents with no higher education in a single income household have obtained.'"
