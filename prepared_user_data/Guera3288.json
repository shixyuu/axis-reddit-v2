        "In response to 'Original Post: Hey guys, I was “quiet quitting” until I got fired , now what? So I just got fired and they recommended me to file for unemployment insurance. HR was surprisingly nice. She basically told me they don’t contest the claims, so I think if I use the right words in my unemployed application,\nI might be eligible for unemployment insurance.\nHas anyone successfully received unemployment insurance benefits in this situation before and lives in the state of Illinois? One of the questions is below:\nAccurately report your reason for separation from your job when you initially file your claim for benefits.\nEDIT: I  shouldn’t have used the term “quiet quitting” on my post because I used the term incorrectly, my apologies. I meant to say, I was really underperforming on my job, barely doing any work for the past year or so. I did the bare minimum. I was  then placed under an improvement plan for a little over 6 months or so. They saw some improvements, and I was doing okay, until I mislead my manager with 2 assignments. I stated that I had completed the assignment but in reality I used last year’s data to mark it completed, while I attempted to catch up over the weekend.\nI never fixed the assignments and my manager found out what I did. That’s when she went to HR for the next steps. I emailed HR for a written confirmation on why I was fired and she responded “unsatisfactory performance.”', a user said: 'I’m in Illinois and got fired from my job back in October. I was fired due to “performance” but was approved for unemployment. It took them like 2-3 weeks to approve it, though. Had to wait for a judificator to contact me via telephone for my unemployment interview, he would then contact my ex-employer to make sure stories matched and from there, had 10 business days to make a decision. I’m Illinois, if they can’t prove that your poor job performance was intentional, then they have to approve your unemployment insurance claim.'"
