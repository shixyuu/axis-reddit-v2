        "In response to 'First article I read about \"quiet quitting\" used the term \"only doing the minimum required for their job\".\nWhich...means they're doing whats required for their job.  Like wtf.', a user said: 'Yeah, that doesn't sound like what I would think of quiet quitting as.  To me quiet quitting would be doing absolutely nothing, and waiting to see how long it takes until you get fired.'"
