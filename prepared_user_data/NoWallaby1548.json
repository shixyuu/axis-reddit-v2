All while many news organizations are seeing a decline in viewership.\nAt least Fox News also saw a huge decline but probably explains the growth in Newsmax as I bet many Fox News viewers moved there', a user said: 'Thanks. I read that after rapid growth following 2020 election, viewership was trickling down. Perhaps in 2023 Q4. Regardless it's revenue is <$100m. Both Dominion and Smartmatic will push them into bankruptcy.'"
