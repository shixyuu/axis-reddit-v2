        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'Just heard this being talked about on a local am radio station. These old fucks are so disconnected and disillusioned. If I’m not at work, I’m not working. No questions asked. My current job wants us to have Teams on our phones in case we are not by our laptops in the lab. I’ve had to ignore many messages outside of my work hours.'"
