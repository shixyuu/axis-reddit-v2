You don't actually do that much lol, maybe the insane working hours made sense when everything was being done on paper, by hand. Now with computer databases/excel/AI workloads are decreased dramatically. Now a large part of your job is sitting around trying to look busy instead of being given any mentally stimulating tasks.', a user said: 'Spot on, which is honestly the majority of office jobs. It tends to always be about taking 2 hours worth of work and stretching it over an 8 hour shift, the only difference with Japan is that the 8 hour shift isnâ€™t an 8 hour shift, you stick around and keep pretending to look busy until your boss leaves which may be several hours after your shift ended.'"
