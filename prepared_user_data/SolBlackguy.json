        "My Boss Met With Me About \"Quiet Quitting\" So I'm going to preface this with a brief description of my work ethic. Just about everywhere I've worked, you could consider me as the \"anchor employee.\" I show up during my scheduled shift, on time and unless it's an actual emergency or death in the family, I always show up. I'm more reliable than death and taxes. On the other side of the coin, I don't usually take extra shifts. I do my 40 hours reliably so I don't have to.\nMy company has been pretty short handed lately because they bit off more than they could chew with a contract. They tried supplementing it with temps (instead of hiring more people) and obviously that bit them in the ass in the long run. Now they've resorted to reducing the number of required workers in departments and taking volunteers for double shifts, extra days and weekends.\nThe other day I'm coming back from my lunch hour and my boss waves me over to his desk. He's also accompanied by the regional site manager that goes to different locations. They tell me to have a seat and the boss goes on about the personnel issues. So I finally address the elephant in the room.\n\"So, you're going to hire more people, right?\"\nThe boss and the regional look at each other and the regional chimes in that they're working on it. They reminded me of the $250 referral bonus if I bring someone in and they stay for at least 6 months. I've recommended people, but they don't like the work schedule and never applied.\nAnyway, the boss starts going on about \"quiet quitting.\" I know what it is and it's absolute bullshit, but I decided to humor him and let him continue his explanation. I waited for an opening and decided to get to the point.\n\"What does this have to do with me?\"\nThe boss brings up my schedule and passive aggressively laments that I'm working 40 hours every week. Then he pulls out the volunteer overtime sign up sheet.\n\"Okay, then do you want me to work more days or something?\"\nThen he goes on the defensive. That's when I remembered that my union contract says all overtime is exclusively voluntary. The boss continues going on circles trying to weasel in that he wants me to take more shifts by reiterating that I'm only working 40 hours.\n\"If you want me to take more shifts, then tell me you want me to take more shifts.\"\nThe boss looks over to the regional who kind of shrugs in a \"fuck it, we tried\" type of way. Then he takes his glasses off and starts massaging his temples in a frustrated manner. I start to get up.\n\"If you want me to take more shifts because you're short handed, all you have to do is tell me.\"\nThen I leave and go back to working my job within my scheduled hours.\nEdit: Since I didn't expect this to get so popular and everyone is asking the same question:\nThe overtime is compensated, very well. You work overnight for 12 hours, from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. So that's overtime, overnight pay, and Sunday premium. I did it for Christmas weekend and had more than enough spending money for my vacation I took a couple weeks later.\nManagement isn't allowed to ask or request anyone to work overtime because to my understanding (this happened before I started working there) management used to play favorites with people on who got to work overtime, even making them do extra work as a way to \"get in good\" so they could get the shifts. It apparently got so bad that the union stepped in and made it voluntary only, with a sign up sheet so that everyone gets a fair chance. Lately less and less people have been volunteering because they're busy working overtime during the week since the temps were all laid off.\nI don't usually take the overtime unless I'm saving up for a vacation or something. That's why management tried to \"ask me\" to work overtime without actually asking me. My 40 hours of work is enough to pay my bills and a bit of spending money. I live a pretty humble life now compared to when I used to have ambition.",
        "In response to 'I hate when things have dumb misnomers. Doing your actual job (no more, no less) should've never been labeled as \"quiet quitting.\" If anything, constantly calling out, being late, and barely doing your tasks should be because it's like you're daring them to fire you.', a user said: 'Which they'll never do because I'm that \"make sure the trains run on time\" employee in the highest traffic 24 hour department.'",
        "In response to 'So you want me to wear more pieces of flair?', a user said: 'Shit! I wish I had quoted that.'",
        "In response to 'Good thing you have a union, probably only reason you're still employed at the moment.', a user said: 'Funny thing is, the union isn't that great. It's like a step up from the bullshit unions you see in grocery stores. They're mainly there to give us free healthcare in exchange union dues. My contractors don't know that though and are more leery of their presence'",
        "In response to 'When this shit happens I can only think “You could roll up your sleeves couldn’t you?”\nAnd if they literally can’t do the job because they lack the skills then they can get fucked.', a user said: 'Yeah, exactly. My manager is one of those pencil pushers that leads from behind. He even says \"I'm not a micro manager or anything\" right before he says some micromanaging bullshit.'",
        "In response to 'The real question is who was the dumb*ss that overcommitted? They need to be run over coals both internally and externally.', a user said: 'Some higher up that probably sits in an office all day.'",
        "In response to 'Management is so easy and fun to fuck with.  I recently saw my GM flippantly tell a coworker to not bother coming in when they delivered their two-weeks.  They were like, \"Okay, if you say so!\"  Within the next week, at least two other people had announced that they were leaving and clown GM over here is calling around to other branches trying to pull employees from their schedules to cover his shortages.  And he's still talking about other employees as disposable when he can't hire people faster than he's firing them or they're quitting.', a user said: 'And they wonder why each generation is more left leaning. Not to mention the based assortment of books in school libraries. So many copies of The Communist Manifesto, Fahrenheit 451, The Way Men and Civilized to Death'",

        "In response to 'I just learned that I’ve been quiet quitting for about a year and a half now. Thanks!', a user said: 'You mean doing the job you're paid to do?'",
        "In response to 'Yeah, but paying more attention to things outside of my work and doing the absolute bare minimum at work.', a user said: 'So having a healthy work/life balance? Quiet Quitting is some bullshit propaganda that slave drivers came up with. If you ever have an employer use that term, it's a red flag to leave. Hell, it's enough red flags to revive the U.S.S.R.'",
        "In response to 'Weird that he couldn't just ask you to take some more shifts. Why is that so hard?', a user said: 'Under the union rules, overtime is strictly voluntary. They can't tell me to work overtime, let alone ask me'",
        "In response to 'This is supposed to incentivize the companies to hire more people instead of overworking a smaller crew.', a user said: 'That. Also the shift premium you get from overtime and the weekend and/or holiday they need the overtime for is good money. I heard years ago under a different contract people monopolized it. So now it's strictly voluntary and people have to take turns. I did Christmas weekend and made like $45/hr'"
