        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'Definitely do what you must for yourself. That comes first and foremost against the University wanting you to write grants while pretty much saying you’re gone in 6-12 months. But also, see your current projects and work through as much as possible, especially if you have any Post docs/grad students as their career prospects will probably rely heavily upon whatever they are currently trying to finish before your deadline.'"
