        "In response to 'I quit from Amazon because I hurt my knee and wanted to ice it, and they told me in the clinic I had to have a manager sign me in. I couldn't find my manager, and so they made me hobble my ass around the fucking factory to find him. Eventually I did, they let me ice my knee, and gave me some Advil. As I was sitting in this room, with a one that hurt way more than it did when it started, I got really pissed and the whole situation. So I clocked out and went home. Fuck that job and fuck Amazon.', a user said: 'If someone told me I needed a managers approval to ice my knee after an accident, I think I'd just fuckin' snap right there. Like, I don't think I'd be going home that day, not at least first visiting a police station involuntarily.'",
        "In response to 'I quit from Amazon once. I just kept eating although the back to work alarm sounded. I got up and went to the HR offices eithout any rush and asked to fill the form. They told me to vome back at the end of the dhift to do it but I said \" No, I'm leaving now\" and they handed it to me...\nThat was the forst time that I sae my facility during the day (In Scotland you entered too early and left when the sun was already down).\nOne of the zenest moments of my life.', a user said: 'You... a form to quit? Is that some EU thing? In the US you just fuck off and never come back.'"
