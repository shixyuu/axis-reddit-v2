        "In response to 'You're not wrong about consumption and how we need both large scale industrial change and individual change to reduce carbon emissions, but the term carbon footprint was coined and spread by that industry astroturfing campaign to make people think it is individuals responsibility alone.\nIt also led to the scam that is carbon offsetting being popularised as an alternative to reducing consumption when most of the popular offsetting schemes had negligible impacts on reducing carbon in the atmosphere.', a user said: 'It bugs me when people say \"it's everyone who needs to reduce\" while yes this is true, you should see how much energy larger businesses especially use before jumping down the throat of the average person. Sure, these businesses put out propaganda frequently to give the impression they are doing all sorts, but the fact is they're half arsing it.\nFor example, on the back of a few Morrisons lorries there's a claim that they try to reduce how often thier lorries g around empty, yet the planning of journeys is an absolute joke and a massive waste of diesel, so it'll go from 1 store to another with only a few cages or pallets on board that could have gone on a single trailer.'"
