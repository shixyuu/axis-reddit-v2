        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'I used to get paid $90 a week stacking shelves. We'd haul these pallets around the store after closing loading up the shelves and ofc me being one of the bigger dudes i got some of the heaviest pallets. One whole pallet filled side to side, about 6 ft high packed with all sorts of jars and drinks. Had to unload it all within an hour and i had to go from aisle to aisle to aisle and they were never in order too. I couldnt give a rude word to try an do it all in an hour'"
