        "In response to 'Original Post: Can we talk about quiet quitting again? Hi,\nI’m a middle-aged associate professor in the humanities at a private university that is thriving as far as these things go. I used to be quite active on this sub, and it helped me both through and past a long period of burnout in 2021–23. Due to some poor thinking and carelessness on the part of administrators, my salary declined last year because I didn’t get as much summer teaching. Downloading my W2 this past week and seeing the impact has kinda wrecked me. I can’t believe at my career stage I earned less in 2024 than in 2023.\nMy immediate reaction is “they pretend to pay me and I’ll pretend to work.” So I’d like to stop saying “yes” to service requests, pushing scholarship through conference presentations to publications, and freeze development on my pedagogy. The issue is that if I pull back from giving a full effort, none of the people who caused this—my unit-level head, staff and admin in the budget office, the senior leadership of the school, and the finance-bro board of trustees—will even notice. But people who have done me no wrong—my students, my colleagues, my department chair—would be impacted. They’d have to pick up my slack, rope others into doing what I currently volunteer to do, get less interaction with their instructor, etc.\nI know this issue has been raised a million times, but please indulge me: what’s the appropriate response to falling salary when for personal and profession reasons switching institutions isn’t an option? How do you frame a decision to pull back to colleagues or chairs you respect?', a user said: 'Seeing the change in the W-2 sounds discouraging.\nYou don’t mention your broader financial picture. When I was an associate professor in my 50s (I’m past 60 now), I would have killed for a tradeoff that says “I do less work and earn less money.”  As it was, I struggled with my R1 research expectations, which meant heavy summer work whether I got paid or not.  (I got paid if I got grants to pay myself.)  Even so, I enjoyed my “research-only” summers a lot.  If I had had to teach year round, it would have broken me.\nWhat do you want out of the next 10 years of your job?  Is “less teaching for less money” an attractive option for you?\nAs for your specifics, if you freeze your pedagogy for a year or two, no animals will be harmed.  And unless you supervise PhD students, declining to push your work all the way uphill to publication harms nobody and nothing except you and your possible chance for future promotion.  But if a year off from publication would make a material difference, I would be surprised. (Like lots of my colleagues, I opted out of the “more, more, more” required to go from associate to full at our private R1.  We have world-famous faculty who are associate.)\nYour colleagues and your department chair can put on their big-kid pants for a year while you figure out what you really want.'"
