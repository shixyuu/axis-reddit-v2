        "In response to 'I applied to a company a few weeks ago and was up front about my base salary expectation. I went through multiple interviews and everything seemed to be going great. I received the offer and it was 30k below the salary expectation I provided.', a user said: 'Hey that's what happened to me a few weeks ago! They also asked me to work on-call and Saturday-Wednesday at 30k under my salary ask!\nSuffice to say they got told \"nope\" and I have 10 more interviews over the next few weeks so my ask is clearly unreasonable.'",
        "In response to 'Nobody wants to work anymore! /s', a user said: 'There's a picture floating around somewhere of that same narrative being pushed every decade. Like news clippings from every decade with the same sort of bollocks going back over 120 years.\nIt's like companies are allergic to paying people what they're worth!'"
