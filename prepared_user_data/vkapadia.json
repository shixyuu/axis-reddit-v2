You have a staff member working in the assigned position doing what they need. It's just about employers wanting to violate your boundaries', a user said: '\"quiet quitting\" has taken on a different meaning than it originally had. It used to be for when you don't actually quit your job, but you slack off and don't really finish your work but still draw a paycheck until you finally get fired. But employers have glommed onto it as a term for anyone not working more than they have to.'"
