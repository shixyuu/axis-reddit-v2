        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. ðŸ’ª', a user said: 'They will just performance you out. Corporations arnt going to pay people more. They structure the jobs to be minimal work. If they pay you more they will expect more. Eventually you cant afford not to work so they win. They just keep the tasks remidal so if turnover is high it will have little impact on team member level jobs. Some one else in the thread said 23 people already gone....doesnt sound like its working out.'",
        "In response to 'Who are they going to replace us with?  They can't even get enough people to fill the registers', a user said: 'Even less qualified people. Have you not been to Walmart? Ive seen people who look like they are currently going through rehab and detoxicing working there. Like i said eventually they win because you need money or become homeless. Its why becoming a union is so hard. People cross the line to work.'"
