It wasn't abusive, just became dead in the water and generally unhappy and the last 8-9 months felt like we were roommates. I started dating my now husband as soon as we broke up because I really didn't need any time to process the whole thing because I had already completely accepted it and mentally moved on. 10 years together and I haven't felt the need to check out yet ðŸ¥°\nOP is onward to better, happier times, for sure ðŸ’œ'"
