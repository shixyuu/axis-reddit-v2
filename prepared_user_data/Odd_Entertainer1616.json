Down to 1 office day a week and 3, 1hour meetings per week, rest of my days are quite empty without any real oversight.\nHonestly might need to start working a bit more, I’ve run out of shit to do, renovated pretty much the whole house, set up a little side hustle that no longer requires much input, run out of shit to watch  on the streaming services.
