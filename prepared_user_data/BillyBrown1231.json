My mom now also understands the egregious inequality of pay today and speaks up when one of her peers says something uninformed.', a user said: 'I'm a boomer and I would never take a pay cut or put up with any shit from an employer. I job hopped before any of you even knew what work was. When you make comments like yours you just show your ignorance. Boomers would never have put up with the crap young people do today. We were the generation that was out in the streets protesting everything and anything.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Bullshit. Ever boomer I know sympathizes with what some young people are going through. When I was in my 20's I was working 2 and sometimes 3 jobs to make ends meet. This generation isn't the only one that has had it tough. I was in my twenties during the 80's when the economy was in the shitter.'",
        "In response to 'You are not your job just as your job is not your family.\nAt 80+, look who just caught up.', a user said: '80+ they aren't boomers. They are too old. Boomers were born after WWII.'"
