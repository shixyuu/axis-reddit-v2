        "In response to 'Literally decades of not matching inflation in wage growth, and increasing workloads. Constant denials of requests for additional headcount. Paying market rate for the clueless new guy but punishing those who favour stability despite them having valuable knowledge and skills the business depends on. Increasing expectations of availability and reduced response times. Why didn’t you read the email I sent at 6:30pm last night before our 8am stand up meeting? Layoffs at the slightest hint of a recession. Refusal to invest in tools and training needed to be efficient. Constant requests to just “spend less” but no reduction in targets.\nWhy the fuck would anyone go the extra mile these days?', a user said: 'Just want to add onto your point about market downturns:\nCompanies are constantly chasing growth but very few seem to try and keep adequate reserves to weather downturns (ie. they only care about the short term). Then it leads to rapid layoffs like you were saying. A few months after layoffs, you then see those same companies start hiring again but suddenly they’ve lost the trust of existing staff and have surrounded them with new employees with lesser experience.'"
