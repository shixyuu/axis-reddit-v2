        "In response to 'do people really do this? I've never heard of taking a 10 before I feel like that goes against the random nature of the game that makes it interesting', a user said: '\"Taking 10\" and \"taking 20\" are rules used in an old edition.\nTaking 10 is effectively what passive perception is, but for any and all skills. It is intended to be used when the character is attempting a task that a) there's no intense time restraints/initiative and b) have no direct downsides to failure. It fixes the player just rolling again and again until they succeed on a roll they can conceivably just repeat.\nTaking 20 is the version for when they character conceivably has plenty of time to roll again and again until a 20 is rolled with absolutely no downsides to failure to failing or trying again. So they just take the time and are assumed to have gotten a maximum result.'"
