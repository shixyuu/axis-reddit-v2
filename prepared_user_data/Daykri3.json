        "In response to 'Eh, Wages vs home prices were WAY more favorable back then.', a user said: 'Not arguing that wages were better back then.  Just saying that saving $3k wasn't a cake walk.'",
        "In response to 'Shit I'd take making more money a year than the cost of my house any day lmao. Show me the money!', a user said: 'The average cost of a house in 1950 was around $8,000 and 20% down was usually required to have any hope of a loan.  The 20% was a little over half the average yearly household income.  Again, I am only trying to point out that saving the 20% was not a cakewalk.  Homes were definitely more affordable back then.'"
