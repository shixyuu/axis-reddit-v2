        "In response to 'I'd say something like 80% of jobs do notbhave that kinda upward mobility', a user said: 'This is what people seem to forget.  Long time ago I used to work in a micro lab and promotions/decent raises were not allowed.  We were even supposed to have a percentage of people get \"partially meets\" even if we had everyone performing well and meeting their targets.  Supposedly there was always supposed to be a \"bottom layer\" (and only one person who did well).  What this meant was that the people who worked hard were never properly rewarded and so would eventually not bother.  The stupid people on top thought they were so clever to suppress wages and gave bonuses to managers who made sure to suppress wages well.  So the more you held back on your workers, the more the manager got.  It is a recipe for disaster and the stupidest system ever.'"
