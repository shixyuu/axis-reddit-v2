You are \"less susceptible\" to \"disciplinary action\" for \"obeying the rules\" but apparently not free from it. Wtf??\nThis remind me of a court case where convictions in a multi million dollar drug bust were thrown out after the redneck cop actually stated on camera that one of the things he looks for when deciding who to pull over was them driving the speed limit. The lawyers appealed the conviction on the grounds that he couldn't use them NOT breaking the law as probable cause and the judge agreed stating that basically that opened the door to having \"probable cause\" to pull literally anyone over and search their vehicle for speeding or not speeding as the case may be. I guess this cop had a really good track record of busting drug mules and lots of them had their convictions overturned. I mean, the people that they were hauling for probably had them killed for losing the dope but that's beside the point. This was in Georgia or Alabama or someplace where it's not uncommon to fuck immediate family members, i can't remember exactly where.'",
