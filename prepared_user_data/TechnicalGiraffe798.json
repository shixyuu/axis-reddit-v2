        "In response to 'Step one: Promote someone to their level of incompetence\nStep two: Watch them fail at their job\nStep three: Put them on PIP. Lay them off. Or fire them.\nOP clearly doesn't want further responsibility. But now they have been promoted. Which means more responsibility and more visibility in the organization.\nVisibility in terms of how much they make and how much the company could save in headcount.\nMore visibility with counterparts and direct reports.\nAnd even if their boss loves them, their boss could get moved to another group or laid off or there could be a reorganization underneath a different manager in the same group.\nAnd all of those things increase the possibility of getting let go or forced to work more than OP wants.\nI think others understand what I am saying since the original comment was upvoted so much.\nIf you want to OE, it's often better to have an individual contributor role at a lower level than a 15% pay bump because you can more easily OE multiple jobs. Two or three jobs at 100% pay is better than one job at 115% of pay.', a user said: 'I think youâ€™re overthinking this a little lol.'"
