        "In response to 'In the corporate world its more of a stigma against employees who dont go the 'extra mile' and do overtime and put in more work to get results especially during busy season.\nWhat really bothered me was when my director said I didnt seem dedicated to the company because I seemed to be \"protecting my teams work life balance\" just because I wasnt signing them up to fix one of her other teams incompetence.', a user said: 'In previous job I did overtime so that my team could deliver.\nDuring 5 years all experienced guys left, while I was made team leader of dudes far younger than me with no experience.\nThey did not engage in the job nowhere near my level or anybody who left.\nAlthough I tried to pour all my knowledge and experience  into them, they stayed at the same level.\nAfter being blamed for my team under delivering (headcount was the same as before the experienced guys quit), and needing to constantly watch their hands and staying longer to fix or finish I said fuck it.\nLike the companies do not understand that experience is worth something.\nI can do shit 10 times faster than any fresh guy, but I earn only 30% more?\nConstantly doing the extra mile because your company refuses to hire experienced workers and leaking experienced ones is a lame experience.\nOvertime not paid but only got days off.\nYeah right I can go for holiday without everything falling apart.\nAfter that experience I learned something.\nNever to engage in your work more than you are expected to or payed for, even when you love it. Don't be a slave.'"
