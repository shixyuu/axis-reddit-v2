        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'Just another idiotic term cooked up by some journo POS alongside side hustle and all the other obnoxious americanism's that are continually forcefed to us on a daily basis.\nIf your job is shit and has no progression don't strain yourself doing it look for a better job.'"
