I wield my ass off from temp to perm...I got my raise finally... they know I'm insulted but my raise because how obnoxious especially when someone got a raise and promotion that left a mess for me to clean up...reminded them it happened to me 3 times. I said I'm flattered you trust me but obviously your promoting entry-level people to these positions,  the last ones left stuff. I don't know why I have job, but sick of bad management to bed pay to bad bad bad everything!!! I don't manage anymore because I'm sick of working with idiots. FYI I'm not that needy or judgemental, but I can't write a 30 page paper on examples. I'm reading company employee reviews at top companies and it seems the finance dept and most companies need the most improvement (I think IT is up there too) but I'm not an expert ðŸ˜‰'"
