        "In response to 'Our CEO told us in a meeting that he didn't believe in inflation, so wahoo to my 3% merit increase despite being a top performer still... meanwhile my electric is up 15%, water up 25%, and natural gas up 12%...', a user said: 'I work for Gannett (news media) in corporate IT, and they froze raises back in 2019 before a corporate buyout happened. The new owners who kept the name also kept the raise freeze in place...\nBut every year submit their own raises to the stockholders to vote for which always passes without even a noticeable fraction going against them. They don't believe in it because they keep stuffing their pockets deeper and deeper so it never impacts them like it does their workers.'"
