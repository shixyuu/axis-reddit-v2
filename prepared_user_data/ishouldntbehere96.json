        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'I thought quiet quitting was leaving without giving a two weeks, so I feel really behind on the lingo I guess'",
        "In response to 'That’s hilarious.\nNot doing any work isn’t “quiet quitting.” That’s just being a bad employee. It’s meeting the requirements of your job well, but not doing anything above that.\nKey point: you have to do your assigned job WELL first. That means, inherently, your students would fail at their jobs.', a user said: 'Yeah I thought “not doing any work” was more “acting your wage” and I assumed “quiet quitting” was quitting without two weeks notice'",

I thought everyone was using “quiet quitting” to mean “acting your wage” but it turns out I was the one who’s wrong lol'"
