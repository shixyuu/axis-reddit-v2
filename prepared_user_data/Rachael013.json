If they don’t they can expect staffing turnover to keep costing their company money as people train, see the work environment, and nope out within a month or two of being in the role.'",

The ones toward millennial Gen are basically millennials with a little extra wisdom and experience and miss all that selfish,  “ima get mine and screw everyone else” boomer nonsense.'"
