        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'It’s always been working to rule … quiet quitting is being used by employers to demean those of us that work to our contract/job specification.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Yup, it’s “working to rule”. Always has been, always will be. “Quiet quitting” is just bullshit to demonise those who have enough self respect to not give away their free time.'",
        "In response to ''Work to rule' has connotations of vulgar lefty working proles shouting slogans while standing around a brazier. Wouldn't fit with middle class sensibilities.\n'Quiet quitting' as a phrase  fits better into dinner party conversation about retreats, mindfullness, yoga, pensions and house prices.', a user said: 'So basically it’s a middle class rebrand'"
