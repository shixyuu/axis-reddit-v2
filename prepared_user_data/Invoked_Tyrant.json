        "In response to 'Original Post: \"Quiet Quitting\" is a bullshit gaslighting term. Don't let it become an acceptable term [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/fwj0foce59k91.jpg', a user said: '\"Quiet quitting\" falls flat on its face and breaks its nose in a spectacular way when you get someone who actively agrees with the term to explain what it means. The conversation plays out like this.\n\"What does quiet quitting mean?\"\n\"Oh it means doing the bare minimum at a job\" \n\"You mean exactly what you're paid to do?\"\n\"No, the job entails certain specifics but more small stuff can be done to be a \"Team Player\"\"\n\"What extra stuff would that be?\"\n\"\nInsert actions and work that clearly should have a separate employee for such actions\nthings of that nature\"\n\"Okay so you want the employee to do more for nothing, okay cool.\"'"
