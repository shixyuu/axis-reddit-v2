They're hoping that workers will believe it, and then attempt to follow that \"trend.\"\nThey want you to feel bad about just doing your job, and they want you to feel like you're in danger of being fired if you don't do extra.\nWhether or not they believe it is irrelevant. They want YOU to believe it.', a user said: 'I'm here to tell you that as a manager, 100% what the article is talking about has happened in the last 4-6 months.\nAttitudes have definitely shifted, and we're in a very, very well paid industry.  Very few candidates for jobs, and very few of our existing folks (though we generally have very, very low turnover) are going anywhere.\nThere's very much a \"wait and see\" attitude right now, at least in professional services companies.\nEDIT:  Sorry for the \"very\" bot, folks.'"
