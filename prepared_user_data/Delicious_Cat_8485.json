May I ask what is wrong with being done with work at 5 PM and not answering work-related texts, calls, and emails when you are on your personal time?\nAmerican employers equate having a work - life balance with “quiet quitting.” This is a sick, dysfunctional perspective which has to be dismantled permanently. Workaholics are generally unpleasant and unbalanced people with abysmal family lives.\nIt’s evil to try to indoctrinate young workers into thinking that this is the standard to which they should aspire.'"
