        "In response to 'Original Post: UCLA SPORTS Analysis: After years of quiet quitting, Chip Kelly admits he didn’t want to be at UCLA https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2024-03-05/analysis-chip-kelly-didnt-want-to-coach-ucla', a user said: 'One time I was running in Manhattan Beach and just happened to see a guy inside a beach house doing the elliptical looking at the ocean. He was kinda old, white, fat, and had a UCLA shirt. It clicked like 5 seconds later that it could have been Chip Kelly. On the way back I confirmed it was indeed Chip Kelly.\nThis was in the middle of the season on random Monday at 11 AM or so (I had a day off). I was wondering why he wasn’t working.\nI honestly don’t understand why he would leave that job, I can’t imagine willingly leaving Manhattan Beach for Columbus. He had the dream job.'"
