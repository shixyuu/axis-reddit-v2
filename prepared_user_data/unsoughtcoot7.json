        "In response to 'Burnt out, yes. Considering a completely different career path. Monthly quota is wearing me down — especially not hitting it these past few months — the pressure looms outside of work and the dread coming back on a Monday isn’t healthy.\nI’m still relatively young (4 years out of uni) but as an introvert I don’t know if I can mentally handle being a full cycle rep of making 50 calls a day plus doing demos and closing deals.\nI love being rewarded for your performance unlike other jobs, and I get to build trust with people and help solve their problems, and I enjoy the grind. But with so many things out of my control (DMs pushing deals months out) it’s freaking tough to keep level headed. I realize why the drinking culture is so rampant in sales.\nI honestly don’t know what to do — been in my role 6 months, I’m building better habits around sleep, mental health, eating, and exercise but I haven’t seen a lasting change. I’m normally an anxious person so I’ll admit maybe I’m just not cut out for the constant pressure sales brings when you’re not doing well.', a user said: 'Maybe consider looking into an AM/renewals role! You still get the rewards of a “sale”, but less pressure and very little (or zero) cold calling.'"
