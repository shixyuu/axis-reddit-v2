        "In response to 'Eeeugh bragging about the hours is one that was chronic when I was a chef. You’re not a real chef unless you’re working 16 hour days for 2 weeks without a day off apparently. The only person they’re mugging off is themselves.\nThe trouble is companies know a lot of chefs have this old school mentality and exploit it, putting them on salaries and making their situation impossible unless they pull stupid hours.\nThe last place I was a head chef at before I quit, my contract was 45 hours. So that’s what I worked one week just to make a point. I came into work on Monday and left packed up for a long weekend off at the end of service on a Wednesday leaving them without a chef for 4 days till I came back on Monday. Weirdly, immediately after that he hired 3 more cooks.\nFortunately I got out of it just last month after years of mental anguish which at one point put me in hospital lol.', a user said: 'Same here mate, theres plenty of good chef jobs about now that dont kill you, anything other than restaurants and hotels is pretty sweet. I was doing exactly that 16h a working through my splits and working all my days off for a shitty salary, when id ask about getting payed they would always say it will get added on, it never was. Also never recieved tips or any proportion of service charge which apparently \"goes towards our hard working staff\" the whole industry is built on lies. It took me getting to 8 stone and looking like i was on deaths door. I didnt even have the energy to quit i just said i had to go to the shop, had a mini breakdown turned my phone off and went to my mothers and slept on her couch for a day and a half.'"
