        "In response to 'Original Post: I for one am grateful for APDs quiet quitting bc my vehicle tags are 3 years expired with no plans for renewal on the horizon. Living dangerously over here.', a user said: 'My tags on all my vehicles are out. They’re all safety only and I’m honestly just waiting until next year when I don’t have to have anyone look at them before I renew. They’re all in great condition and everything works, so they would pass if o asked someone, but it’s soooooo annoying to wait in line for an inspection three different times.'"
