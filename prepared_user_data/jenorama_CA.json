        "In response to 'I quiet retired.  I’m one of those MBA guys.  I left a good 6-figure salary corporate career job because I just could t take it anymore. After my husband died, I didn’t care anymore; it didn’t matter to me. Career was so unimportant anymore. So I stopped caring, got offered severance and took it. Never want to go back. I soft retired. I got a job at a doggie day care and am happier than I’ve been in awhile. I play with dogs all day making enough to meet my minimal expenses.', a user said: 'I left my high stress tech job in May of 2022. I had a year’s salary in the bank and my husband was still working (and is still working) at the company I left. Since then I’ve done a month long cross country road trip with my dad, home improvements, a cruise with my 30+ year BFF, been available for family health challenges and played a shit ton of video games. I’m starting to think of going back to work, but I don’t think I’d do tech again. I want something that is fulfilling, but still flexible. I don’t need vacation time, but I want to be able to say, “Sorry, I’m not available these weeks/days.”'"
