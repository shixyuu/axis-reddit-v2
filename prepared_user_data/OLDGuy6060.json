[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/6357ek17i7w91.png', a user said: 'Corporatists feel if you spread the lie long enough and loud enough, the gullible will fall for it.\nGuess what people? Getting laid off RARELY has to do with the amount or quality of your work.  You could rape the owner's daughter on a zoom call and if the company needs a warm body in your seat with the wage they are paying you, you are safe. If you saved the CEO's fucking life and they found someone in India who will do your job just as well for half the price, you are fucked.\nStay the course, peeps! Act your wage!'"
