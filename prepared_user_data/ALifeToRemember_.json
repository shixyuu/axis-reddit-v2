        "In response to 'The post makes no sense. Drop in life expectancy = economic failure?\nUnquestionably so, your comment makes no sense.\nThe economy is defined as the wealth & resources of a country. The US is failing to appropriate adequate wealth & resources to the health of our country.', a user said: 'Is there a source for the life expectancy graph for USA? I searched but I could find no graph matching this one, only ones that disagreed such as\nhere\n.\nAdditionally, I have heard from fairly trusted sources that the biggest life expectancy drop in the US recently (at least pre COVID), was from the opioid crisis, and that drop was merely 0.2 years. This seems to contradict your graph.\nI might well be mistaken, I haven't done extensive study on this, but I would like to see some sort of source that backs up your claim.\nEdit: It seems I may have misinterpreted the graph, as such I cannot comment on its accuracy since I have no knowledge of recent life expectancy trends, my apologies.'"
