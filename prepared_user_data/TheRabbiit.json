        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'Lying flat does you no favours except protecting a fragile ego (if I may borrow your username lol). Lying flat in my opinion is borne of a fear of failure. If you fail then it doesn’t matter because you didn’t try in the first place.\nHaving said that though, life can be very unfair and in everything you do or choose there is also a large element of luck involved. So accept that hard work alone may sometimes be insufficient. But at the same time life’s unfairness or luck should not be an excuse to stop trying.'"
