        "In response to 'Which is why it's crazy that that is used as a means to protest. Hey I'm just going to do exactly what you pay me for until my demands are met!', a user said: 'It also involves not using shortcuts etc.\nLet's say youre contracted to work 9-5 monday-friday, with your 30min break at 1300 every day. But, you have a regular customer who calls at 1300 every day (for whatever reason). Instead of shunting your break back by ten minutes, like normal, you refuse and take your break at 1300 as per contract. Customer is pissed, but nobody can do anything about it.\nInstead of taking the cash for the day to the bank at 1630, and going straight home afterwards, you start to take it at 0900 - and only returning to work at 1000 because that's how long it takes to get to the bank and back.\nLoads of little things in the Rules that we sidestep, or work around, that you then follow strictly to the letter, causing unintentional chaos and/or drastically slowing the work down, even to the detriment of your own work.'",
        "In response to 'It’s nothing new, not quite sure why it needs a specific term. The term itself is also bolkocks as it doesn’t involve quitting.', a user said: 'The new term has come from America, which has mostly lost it's unions and doesn't have terms like \"work-to-rule\"'"
