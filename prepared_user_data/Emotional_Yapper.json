        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting life I am quiet quitting life and nobody realizes that’s what it is. My friends think I’m just being a bad friend. My family just thinks I’m being a bad family member. I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live in the world any more. I just want to go to work and then come home and that’s it. I don’t want to go have dinner with people anymore. I don’t want to hang out and be made to feel obligated to stay until 11 pm before I can go home.  Nobody realizes that this is my way letting go of life, of escaping from the world.  I’m alone, I’m 30 years old and haven’t had an intimate partner for a decade. I love those in my life tremendously. But I just want to let go. When I’m home, I’m free to be who I want. To feel how I want, to look how I want. I can say what I want, my cat doesn’t mind. He doesn’t judge. He looks up to me and needs me and he’s the only thing that’s warm in my bed.  There’s nothing more signifícate to write here. Just thank you for listening.', a user said: 'This is me so hard. I'm 30f, I was in a relationship, but it was abusive. I've just given up on everything. I come home and smoke weed, eat, game/watch TV/exist. Do this over and over and hope someday that something kills me and puts me out of this misery.'",
        "In response to 'I was in exactly your spot a year and a half ago. I'm doing better now, and I hope you'll be doing better soon too.\nLean into the interests you had before your ex, or pick a hobby at random and try it. That's my unsolicited advice.', a user said: 'Thank you for reaching out. I really really hope I'll be in a better place in that time frame as well. I'm trying to find a hobby or something, but it's hard right now to enjoy most things. It seems like something always seems to go wrong and it keeps knocking me down a bit.'"
