Started directing everyone who came to me for help to “our new supervisor.” Started taking vacation and sick time.\nI like your post, but can we please stop using the term \"quiet quitting?\" What people characterize as \"quiet quitting\" used to be known as \"doing your job.\" Everything you describe here is how work is supposed to be.\nThe term \"quiet quitting\" was invented to make workers feel bad about stuff like taking lunch, leaving at the end of the day, taking vacation, and not responding to emails after hours.\nThis is what you're supposed to do.\nThis is NOT a form of quitting.
