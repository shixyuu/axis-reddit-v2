        "In response to 'You've clearly never had to manage government employees. When something needs to get done, it needs to get done. You can't fire people for being useless. You basically have to catch them committing actual crimes on the clock, and even then, there's often a long drawn out battle with the union, where the person may still keep their job. Those useless people could tank the manager's promotion opportunities though, so they end up dumping more of the work on the employees that actually work.', a user said: 'If you're doing a government job, the employee has more rights bc of union backing. Also work should be evenly distributed during employees at a government job without any bias. If I was the employee, I would state plainly that this isn't my work and ask for clarity as to why I am being asked to do this. And I would do this in email format for documentation. It's up to the manager to complete the work that's not done some how. It shouldn't fall on a different employee.'"
