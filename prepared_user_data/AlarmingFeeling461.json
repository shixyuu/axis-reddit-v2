        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting: What is it Really? Quiet quitting is a confusing term to me, but maybe I just don’t understand it. I have rarely ever given 120% to a job… maybe when I was fresh out of college when I had that mindset. But the years have jaded me. What people call “quiet quitting” (doing the minimum) is what I just call doing my job lol. It’s not like I refuse when they ask me to do more work (tho rarely do they ask), but I don’t SEEK more work out unless I’m just bored. For example, in my work, we work in Sprints and get assigned stories to do for those sprints. I just do those stories — not more or less — unless I’m just bored and have finished my stories weeks in advance, then I may grab a story for the next Sprint. I get paid by the hour so no work means no pay. But it’s not like I can ADD more stories to the current Sprint because someone else still needs to test them and THEY may not have capacity. So, a lot of times I just do things around the house since there always seems to be something to do at home. Have I been quiet quitting for years and just didn’t know it or is doing the minimum not really what quiet quitting is all about?', a user said: 'I had a teammate quiet quit at my last job. Essentially she quit about a year before she just stopped showing up. \nShe would tell people that she was working, she’d put in a good effort at meetings and because we were remote and adults, they assumed she was telling the truth. \nIt all started to unravel slowly and she started taking meetings in her car, at doctors appointments in the waiting room and eventually she just started showing up late & missing meetings. We slowly found out there was a huge backlog of work that wasn’t done for her clients even though she told them and us it was done. She b.s.ed all of us to cover her tracks so she didn’t have to actually do any work. \nTowards the end she was constantly out sick. She would sit in on meetings while leadership basically yelled at her and she would swear she would knock it all out in time, but she never did anything. \nEventually she “got sick” and went on disability- or so she said, so she couldn’t be fired. She never completed the paperwork apparently so the company had to continue paying her for months and months. \nThey couldn’t reach her. She didn’t answer the phone, wouldn’t answer messages on linked in… never called. \nWe found out later she went back to her old job and was most likely getting two paychecks for a while. \nI think the whole process was quiet quitting but eventually led to job abandonment.'"
