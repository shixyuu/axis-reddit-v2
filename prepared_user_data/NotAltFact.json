        "In response to 'Absolutely. The day in the office is hammer time. I get as much done as possible. Day after, it‚Äôs clock in, monitor any emails that may come in, and do me for the day. If you‚Äôre going to make me drive an hour in at 6am, pay for parking downtown, have to buy lunch and my own coffee, then drive another hour back home, all doing exactly everything I do at home, without even having a meeting, you better believe that next day is a free day for me.', a user said: 'Or maybe you just have ‚Äúlunch meetings‚Äù with your team or ‚Äúcollaborate with new colleagues‚Äù‚Ä¶..üòè'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'If work requires me to go back then I‚Äôm channeling my helmo which means my diet consists of lots and lots of fishes. And helmo hearing is not good which means a lot of ‚ÄúHUH? I CANT HEAR YOU! SPEAK UP‚Äù. And lunch meetings. Gotta be a team player'"
