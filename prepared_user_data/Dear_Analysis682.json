        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I got a promotion and a job i love. My whole goal at work is to do the work and get out on time. I stopped doing the social things that were expected but take up a lot of time, I'm not spending hours organising team lunches and raffles and morning teas. I do what's expected and I don't go looking for extra work. If I see something that can be done better I'll bring it up and work on improvements (cos that's part of my job) but I don't stress about things now. As I'm working on something half expect it to not go ahead so when it doesn't I don't get upset. I don't stress because I do what I can. I decided a while ago that if something was Important the business would allocate enough funds and resources and if they haven't given us what we need then they obviously don't think it's important. My job is to escalate issues, show what's not being done because we don't have resources (staff) and to do what I can. I can't work miracles and I'm not going to try. I think it's actually helped my communication and time management at work, because I stress less I get more done  I leave work on time and I take time off if I need to get to appointments. I'm not slack, I do my work, I'm just not pushing myself to go above and beyond. It doesn't serve me.'"
