        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'Much of Japanese culture that the US doesn't get is the concept of 'self sacrifice' and 'grin and bear it' to the point that it becomes performative. That is how you get an unproductive society that still works long grueling hours. You must perform your 'self sacrifice' to justify your place within society and in the company. It is unsustainable. It is why Japan has such a heavy drinking culture, as it is one of the few socially acceptable ways to 'unwind.' I love Japan, but they really could do with a better understanding of 'if you are suffering, you can't help others''"
