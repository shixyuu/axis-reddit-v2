        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'This! Speaking as a teacher. I have to quiet quit or I will lose my mind. Which means I won't be able to get any of the extra BS they make us do. Nor will I be taking work home. Or buying any more supplies for work. After the Covid horror that still continues- I am beyond broke. I deleted all school related apps on my phone. I could go on.'"
