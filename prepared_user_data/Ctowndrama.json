        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting........ [External Link]: https://v.redd.it/oss4az9norxe1', a user said: 'I love the \"you chose this job\" line I always see. Now, first, what this person is doing is unacceptable and ridiculous. I don't disagree with the opinions on that. Next, we all know none of these drivers woke up one day and were handcuffed and forced to deliver packages for Amazon. Yeah, we get that. Everyone there made that choice. What most non-DSP drivers don't understand as they spit judgemental nonsense in this sub is basically ANYTHING about the job (even the drivers from other delivery companies. If you haven't delivered as a DSP driver, it's different). It's not an easy job. But let's forget the difficulty part of it for a moment\n. Things have drastically changed and most people can't just quit and find a new job. It's different from state to state, route to route. But when most people signed up at my DSP for example, it went like this: 110-120 stops=an easy day / 121-140 stops=an average day / 141-160ish=a heavy day (YMMV depending on the kind of routes you have/areas but the basics remain the same), then Peak comes and you get slammed with 170-190 stops. It's okay, they know it's peak and it's a small period of time where you'll get to make a ton of OT and maybe get some extra bonuses and such. Woohoo! But then comes like mid-January and everything goes back to normal.....except it didn't. It's been insanely high for the last year plus since 2023 peak. 190 stops every day, 400+ packages. Do more stops in the same amount of time. Changing the metrics. Changing the rules. Changing the ways drivers get punished. The only thing that really hasn't changed is the pay.  Yes, they signed up for this job. But it was essentially a different job.\n\"Just quit\" yeah ..just quit. Everyone can't just quit immediately and have no issues. Picture your job, whatever it is, and you go into work tomorrow and they tell you that now you have to do 30% more work in the same amount of time, for the same amount of money, while you're being constantly monitored and your performance guidelines have changed again. Maybe you're a school teacher and instead of 25 kids, you now have 35 kids and each of them have to get an A on the test this Friday or next week you'll lose a day of work and not be paid (yes yes, but pretend you don't have a union). I'm sure someone can come up with a better comparison , I don't have the will right now. But my point of this long post was, yes, I don't condone this type of behavior and taking it out on the customer (especially when they've not been hostile or venomous to you) is not the way to do this, but the lack of empathy towards drivers is sometimes just so ridiculous. Most can't just quit and as I have explained, this was a VERY different job not so long ago.'"
