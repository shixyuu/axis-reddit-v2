Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'Wally reflector.  It's amazing how many people wander off when you give them tasks they have to do.\nhttps://imgur.com/Db0c9eP'",

Despite exceeding expectations on my performance reviews, I still got the same paltry 2% raise as my coworkers 2 years in a row. I stopped working as hard afterward in that job and in future jobs.', a user said: 'Meets expectations is the expected default.  Deviation from that is either the company trying to cut headcount or a well meaning manager about to get railed by HR for giving anything above.  I've had those well meaning managers get eviscerated for trying to give me an exceeds.'"
