        "In response to 'Admin has made a number of decisions in the last two years that have amounted to several pay cuts and huge demands for more work. My response has been:\nTake service commitments only if they come with course release or stipend.\nSay yes to students but no to admin unless there is extra money involved (no volunteering for their pop up committees, town hall meetings, etc).\nRespond, but don't be proactive, especially if admin is about to shoot themselves in the foot. I've been around long enough to know when they're about to hurt themselves, but they don't want to hear that their idea isn't brilliant, so I just sit quietly while they break things.\nSkip everything optional.\nResearch what would be interesting to me anyway, even if it wasn't published.\nUse every perk of the job to comfort myself: all the CE money, any scheduling flexibility, etc.\nRemember that this isn't forever and have a back up plan.\nI hope we all find a way through!', a user said: 'Can you share your backup plan?'",
        "In response to 'Summer teaching!?  Count me out.  I love teaching, but without summers off, I think I’d go crazy.', a user said: 'For us, even one summer course- can be a significant pecuniary opportunity. My first year at my current Uni I was able to make 20% of my 9 month salary with 2 ,courses. Since then, the summer allocation has been cut between 15-20% every year- and no 9 month faculty are guaranteed a class anymore; and no one can teach two courses. “Adjuncts are cheaper” is what gets spewed when scheduling. Right now each program finds the adjuncts- so I wonder when they’ll make the move to “admins” will list the job description and hire adjuncts. (Really, you’re gonna find a PhD to teach for $3-4k for a graduate class in the summer? Even if I knew someone willing, there’s so much wrong with that…'"
