        "In response to 'I was enlisting but grabbed a job with Panera to hold me over until I left for boot camp. I repeatedly told them time and time again. Don't schedule me for these days, I'm not a permanent employee, and I have random obligations that need to be met for MY goals. They would keep me way past my shift to finish food prep because they would go through so much food and only had a single prep person. Then they scheduled me for a big corporate initiation thing on a day I had obligations. I said enough is enough and slept in the next morning. I answered the call from one of the AMs and said, \"Yeah I quit, I told you guys I have obligations and you don't care about my time, bye\"\nI came in to collect my last check and was officially banned from entering that store.', a user said: 'I came in to collect my last check and was officially banned from entering that store.\nHow petty. If I were feeling like some revenge, I would definitely report that to corporate. No way is that kosher.'"
