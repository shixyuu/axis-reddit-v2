        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. ðŸ’ª', a user said: 'Don't help spread the propaganda.  Fulfilling your job description isn't \"quiet quitting\" it's literally what you're paid to do.  Doing more than your assigned job and not getting paid for it isn't a good work ethic, it's just another example of worker abuse.  You shouldn't be expected to do things beyond your job.'"
