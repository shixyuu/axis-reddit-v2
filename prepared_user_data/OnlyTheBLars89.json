Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'I remember I quit over a Panerai bread order. This lady basically asked me to buy her something with my own money. $60 worth of sandwiches. Yun yum....and I still wasn't fired. Idk how the hell these people get canned for doing nothing. I treat shitty people so awful, my account should have been deleted a long time ago.'"
