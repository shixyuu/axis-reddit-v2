        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'support would have contacted the customer via phone call and discuss the situation. either the customer hadnâ€™t picked up the call from DD or you just straight up cancelled the order yourself to steal the food and also which DID hurt your completion rate.. why you capping bro?'"
