        "In response to 'I mean isn't that just called \"working?\" Oh no people are doing their jobs and then leaving at the end of their shift won't someone think of the poor business men :( :( :(', a user said: 'Exactly. You get paid to do something and you do it. Employer wants you to do more? He has to pay you more. Simple as that.\nQuiet quitting as described above is not a thing. It's just a phrase made to shame people who know their worth and won't let themselves be exploited by their employers.\nIt's getting more common that people don't let their bosses dictate their lives and have more healthy attitude towards working. So employers are obviously pissed and need to find a way to shame, blame and guilt trip employees into being their obedient servants and punching bags again. Hence all the propaganda you see in the US - quiet quitting, \"you shouldn't be using your PTO, think about your boss and your company!\", \"nobody wants to work anymore, millenials are lazy!\". Funny that you won't see that outside of US.'"
