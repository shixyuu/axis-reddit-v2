        "In response to 'The \"work ethic\" that didn't really exist? My observations living in Japan have been that there are two types of \"Japanese work ethic.\" One is the master craftsman who dedicates their life to their trade in pursuit of perfection, sometimes to a toxic level which more or less abandons their family responsibilities. The other is appearing to be busy without accomplishing anything, as is typical in the corporate world, which isn't really a work ethic at all.', a user said: 'I really can't agree because the service level you see for wait staff is an excellent example of a great work ethic. Whenever I compare Denmark to Japan at this specific point, I really hate the lazy Danish service'",
        "In response to 'I'm not sure that's work ethic though, that's simply the job expectation in Japan. If they did it the Danish way they'd get fired.', a user said: 'That is what work ethic is.. A cultural norm of living up to job expectations.'"
