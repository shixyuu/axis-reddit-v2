        "In response to 'It isnâ€™t fucking quiet quitting. What a terrible fucking word. It is quiet firing, do more with with no pay increase all while costs are going up with profits. Company owners are doing this to their workforce, not the other way around.', a user said: 'Totally agree.   I think this term is completely mischaracterized and bastardized by Corporate America.\nWhen you tell me someone has \"quiet quit\", I think that person is simply not working to a reasonable standard.  Think doing juuuust enough work to not get fired.\nI feel like corporate America is trying to brainwash us all into thinking otherwise.  Having a work life balance should never be called 'quiet quitting' - yet here we are.  Ceasing to work overtime for nothing is NOT \"quiet quitting'.'",
        "In response to 'I don't even see it as doing \"just enough to not get fired.\" I see it as putting in boundaries with your employer and doing what you are paid to do/your job description and not that plus 1/3 of three other jobs the employer has refused to fill without getting paid more for it.', a user said: 'Right on.\nSomehow,  corporate America equates \"quiet quitting \" by refusing to do extra to cover for their cheapness/ poor decisions.'"
