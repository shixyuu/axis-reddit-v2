        "In response to 'That's what I took it to mean too\nAnd it's totally a thing. I've hired at least 5 new employees in the last few months who accepted the job and then just didn't show up for their start date and never replied.\nThey accepted the terms then changed their mind and couldn't be bothered to tell me leaving me without staff I thought wanted the job.\nHow people think this is appropriate or support this is fucking baffling.\nThey should be ashamed of themselves. It's a sign of our fast food culture. It's happened to personal relationships via tinder and its now happening in professional relationships', a user said: 'And it's totally a thing. I've hired at least 5 new employees in the last few months who accepted the job and then just didn't show up for their start date and never replied.\nThe people you didn't hire, did you call them and tell them you'd decided on someone else? Or just ghost them?  Because I'll be honest here: as a guy nearly in retirement who's worked for a lot of companies and interviewed with a lot more, I've\nnever\nhad one who I interviewed with but who didn't elect to hire me call me and tell me that.\nNever.  Not once.\nMaybe you're special and different, but that's the norm.\nSo, if a would-be employee finds a better offer (they're obviously not going to talk about where else they're applying to work at during the interview) why should they tell you?\nIt's easy to understand if you put yourself in their shoes.  They're blanket applying at a range of places.  Some they want to work for, some they don't really - but we all\nneed\nto have jobs, so we don't just apply for our dream jobs if we're not currently working.  Gotta pay the bills.\nSo you accept every job offer, then actually take the best one.\nIn your case?  I'd argue your problem is that you are not competitive. 5 people all who chose other employers than you after getting your job offer?'"
