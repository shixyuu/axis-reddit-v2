        "In response to 'Has anyone here ever worked somewhere, had a supervisor quit, then had to do the supervisor's job, but while being told they can't actually make you officially the supervisor yet, just so they don't have to give you a pay rise? I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'My manager quit beginning of the year and our CEO asked me if I wanted to take the job. I said \"sure, but I won't do it for a â‚¬ less than what he got\". Took my CEO a couple days to respond but knowing the job market at the moment, I knew I was holding the best hand and he had no choice but to give me what I wanted.'"
