        "In response to 'My schools is having a “fright night” tonight for Halloween. Little games and activities for students to come and do things for fun and win candy or whatever else. I’ve said multiple times I’m not going or volunteering because it’s not in my contract. “But it’s for the kids.” Of course it is, and they will be fine without me there', a user said: 'We have something next week on Thursday that we’re “required” to be at. My husband and I made plans for a trip over a year ago this weekend and we’re leaving right after school Thursday and then I’m taking Friday off. I won’t be there, no matter how much you threaten me with being written up.'",
        "In response to 'Volunteering, no.  Not my job.\nTaking over new responsibilities that are part of the job description for other people, no. Not my job - literally someone else's.\nGrading/planning at home...yes.\nThis isa salaried job, not an hourly one, and we do not WANT to be treated like clock workers- it's bad for kids, and bad for professionals.\nIf you're being asked to write LONGER plans than before, you negotiate it as a salary bump.  Same with adding to our plates.  Our job is not \"working as long as we are in the building\".  That's not what salaries do - and our contracts\ndistinguish\nclearly, and on purpose, between \"in building hours\" and responsibilities, and sometimes we do a few hours of that at home - just like lawyers and doctors do.', a user said: 'I don’t know of any doctor that works outside of the hospital or any lawyer that works at home but doesn’t bill the client for those hours. I also don’t know of any lawyer or doctor that makes less than 50k with 10 years of experience. That’s why the term “act your wage” is appropriate. I’m not going to put in 60 hours at home for <50k job that’s mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically abusive.'"
