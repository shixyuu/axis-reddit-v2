        "In response to 'I like Kamala a lot and I think she is smart, warm, and hilarious. But I agree with you that she's not a great national candidate. She is too cautious and perhaps too kind to have the killer political instincts that candidates like Obama and, in his own idiotic way, Trump have. And she seemingly couldn't bear to break from Biden as she saw it as a betrayal.', a user said: 'I think there’s even a way to answer that question without even really brutally breaking from Biden, necessarily, or at least it’s an implied break- something like “knowing what we know now, I’d try a few things differently to accomplish our shared vision on (housing/minimum wage/whatever policy you pick), because I won’t quit until the American people have better (housing/infrastructure/whatever policy outcomes). Joe and I shared that vision, and I want to accomplish that in my presidency..”\nI’d stick with the vague “visions” description, like you both want to see more affordable housing/lower inflation/whatever, but not saying specifically how you’d do it differently in that instant.'",
        "In response to 'Trump is extremely straightforward.\n99% of what he says is a lie or just wrong. He exaggerates all the time and spouts straight-up nonsense.\nBut he is clear. You ask him something, and he gives you an answer. I find it hard to believe we have to pick between somebody who can not give a straight answer to a hard question, and something that spouts gibberish 80% of the time.\nThere has to be a better candidate.', a user said: 'The problem is, they’re all too young. We need someone pushing triple digits.'"
