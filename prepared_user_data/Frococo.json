        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I think this is a really key point that the men in these situations literally don't notice the relationship is in danger. If something is wrong and I'm withdrawing in some way my partner notices and reaches out more to try to connect and/or asks me about it. Sometimes it's something that bothered me within the relationship, often not. But he notices something is off either way. I can't imagine getting to the point where I've spent weeks or months creating distance and getting ready to end the relationship without him noticing.'"
