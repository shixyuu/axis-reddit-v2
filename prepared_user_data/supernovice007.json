        "In response to 'No Gen-Xers are talking about quiet quitting, we did and still do the same thing.  The media is trying to continue this bullshit line.  Quiet Quitting isn't a thing, its' called \"doing what you hired and pay me to do, no more, no less\".   MSM wants to make not going above and beyond without compensation or for intangible compensation back to being the standard.  Shit, Office Space wasn't the only Gen X movie to show that off (probably the best one though lol).', a user said: 'No bullshit. There was a movie literally called “Slacker” that the media and our boomer parents pushed as being about typical Gen-Xers who are lazy and don’t want to work.\nSame tired bullshit, new generation.\nEdit to get the right movie name. “Slacker” from 1990, not “Slackers” from 2002 (and kind of terrible)'"
