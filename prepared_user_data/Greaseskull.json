        "In response to 'Original Post: You’ve Heard of Quiet Quitting. Now Companies Are Quiet Cutting Layoffs are down, but employers are still finding ways to cut jobs -  Is this normal or economy tanking? More problems expected in late 2023 or 2024?\nWorkers are waking up to emails and team-meeting requests with a jarring message: They aren’t fired but their jobs are gone.\nPeople on the receiving end of these memos describe running through a range of emotions, from relief that they’re still employed to a sense of dread that their bosses secretly want them to leave.\nhttps://archive.ph/cYXyk\nhttps://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youve-heard-of-quiet-quitting-now-companies-are-quiet-cutting-ba2c326d', a user said: 'Reminds me of a convo I had in my last job.\nBoss: “hey business is way down, I need you to reduce headcount asap - find a way to cut 15 people as quickly as you can.”\nMe: “damn, that sucks. So we’re having a layoff?”\nBoss: “no no no, don’t say that. Layoffs require severance. I need you to find a way to cut lower performers. Say their call volume is low etc. loop in HR if it’s going to be a hot potato but otherwise get to it”.\nWent on to let go of 15 people. Zoom call of death on a Friday. HR was non existent because we were firing so many people at once.\nWeeks later I get a call from HR that she suspects I have a “racial bias” because statistically, I had a marginally higher term rate for people of color. I’m floored. Confused. I had absolutely no thinking around this - I just had to get rid of those who statistically under performed compared to their peers.\nTwo weeks later, I quit. To hell with being the messenger of death. I’ll just OE and make the same/more money to not have to be the Dick.'"
