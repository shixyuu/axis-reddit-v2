        "In response to 'Yup. It used to be called “work to rule” aka work the rules explicitly stated in the contract and no more.', a user said: 'We “worked to rule” for 2 days last year due to stalled contract negotiations. Our district retaliated by ignoring teacher appreciation week (not even allowing our PTO to appreciate us—individual parents paid out of their own pocket to bring us breakfast one day).\nAnyway, this field sucks.'",
        "In response to 'Teacher appreciation week is usually bullshit or insulting anyway.  Always damaged my morale more than helped it.  It was usually like being told that your friends organized a party for you and then barely anyone shows up.', a user said: 'It is. But getting literally no acknowledgement at all, after one of the most difficult years of teaching, was a huge slap in the face.'"
