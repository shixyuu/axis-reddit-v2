        "In response to 'Same. My current job is practically permanent WFH (tbf I work in tech, there\nis\nno reason we need to be at the office every day). The pay's not great, but it's not bad either, I've shopped around.\nShit, even if you doubled my pay I would seriously doubt I'd be willing to go back to commuting everyday. Not to mention my office isn't even that far, a new job would almost certainly be much further away.', a user said: 'Same. I am looking but only interested in remote positions. A recruiter asked me if I'd be interested in a job that literally paid almost double, but would require me to be in the office 2 days/week (I currently WFH full time) and it's over an hour drive each way. I said no thanks, I'm only interested in remote positions but best of luck! He said \"well it's\nonly\ntwo days a week, and after a while you might be able to negotiate down to one!\" Bro, no lmao'"
