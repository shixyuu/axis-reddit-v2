        "In response to 'Gen Xers were the first gen to get screwed by boomers.\n\"The boomers are going to be retiring soon, and then all these wonderful job opportunities are going to open up!\"\nThey've been feeding that to us since I went to college in the 90s. Who would have thought that boomers would love hustling so much that they'd choose to do it until they die?', a user said: 'I could not agree more.\nMany of the boomers have pensions, secure retirement accounts that are funded, and still, they won't fucking leave.\nMeanwhile, we joined organizations as they 'phased out' their pension plans, enrolled in shitty 401k plans that took big chunks of our money, and we continued to make less than the fat blobs of crap that the boomers are.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: What to do if my counterpart has \"quiet quit\"? One of my coworkers has been quiet quitting for a long time. But we're basically in a workplace where people are unfireable (government job). His boss does not seem to want to confront him about slacking, so instead, she gives his work to me and makes everything about \"we\" and \"us\" instead of \"him\".\nInstead of telling him directly, for example, \"hey PERSON X, why aren't you responding to my e-mails?\" She'll e-mail both of us and say \"Hey Team, why aren't you guys responding to my e-mails?\" (When it's very obviously him, not me.)\nWhen he decides not to do his work, she just gives his work to me.\nHonestly, I don't care if he quiet quits -- that's his business. But when his refusal to do work is falling on my table, that's where I start to see things getting problematic. How would you deal with this situation? Telling on him is not a good option, we are equals in the workplace and he considers me a friend.\nEDIT: Wow, so many responses! Yes perhaps my use of \"quiet quitting\" wasn't the right choice of words. My coworker came into my office on Friday and told me he doesn't \"give a f***\" about this job but he feels powerful because he feels \"unfireable\". He spends the entire day working on his own stuff (he has a few side jobs that he does). Our boss seems to be intimidated by him and takes the easy way out - instead of giving work to someone who's going to push back, she'll dump it on others instead. Firing someone is an extremely complicated and long process here, and probably not something she wants to go through. The boss is in her third trimester of pregnancy and getting ready to go on maternity leave. My coworker and I have similar job descriptions so it's easy to give his work to me. Addressing the \"friend\" issue: yeah, I don't really know if \"friend\" was the right word here either. But we're equals and I guess you could say \"friendly\" to each other. Coworker brings me baked goods sometimes, has invited me to get-togethers, things like that. Situation really sucks.', a user said: 'That's a shit manager and a shit 'friend'. Both are exploiting you.\nA person cannot be fired if their manager fails to document their poor performance.\nu/OliviaPresteign\nhas offered some good guidance. You can also say, \"The work assigned to me was completed on this date at this time. Please let me know if you did not receive the work that I sent to you and I will be happy to forward it again.\"\nIf she assigns you the other person's work, you can simply say, \"I am uncomfortable taking on additional assignments that were supposed to be completed by someone else. Have you documented the lack of response from the other worker?\" That way you are putting the manager on notice that this doesn't fly.\nI was hired into a government position with a union contract. It took my boss a full year to get my predecessor dismissed, the union fought to keep the slacker, but my boss prevailed. That person didn't even come to work for nearly a year, so your boss needs to step up and manage their staff, not just manage the workload.\nAlso, start looking for another role. If your manager won't manage, you may need to move on.'"
