        "In response to 'My friend was very vocal about what he would no longer do. Someone quit about a year ago, and he took on that person’s work. It was the same as what he does, but meant significantly more work. Since they had to return to the office, he cancelled all meetings related to the additional work. He told his boss he couldn’t do it if he had to commute five days a week.\nIt’s been about six months now.  They haven’t fired him yet.', a user said: 'What a scummy move by the mgt to push that work on him.   This is happening everywhere though.\nThis is why I tell everyone if you always gotta look out for yourself.  Only way to really get a pay increase is to leave for a new job.\nI just hope the pendulum eventually swings back to employees.'",
        "In response to 'Back in my commuting days, I had an unpredictable commute. So I would get in early. I’d get some personal stuff done or catch up on some work stuff while I had my breakfast.  Problem was that my boss started calling or messaging me an hour before my scheduled starting time or even earlier for urgent tasks and I’d still get stuck late and or have to work through lunch.  I was exempt so no overtime. And then she started calling me on weekends.\nI eventually got very burned out.  I won’t log in early. Of course wfh is a more predictable commute! Which helps.\nBut I learned my lesson after being woken up on a Sunday around 10am on one of the rare weekend days I’d managed to sleep.', a user said: 'Yah that's bullshit.  Thankfully this job doesn't have me put in extra hours on the weekend'"
