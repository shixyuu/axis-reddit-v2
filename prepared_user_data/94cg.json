        "In response to 'Our CEO told us in a meeting that he didn't believe in inflation, so wahoo to my 3% merit increase despite being a top performer still... meanwhile my electric is up 15%, water up 25%, and natural gas up 12%...', a user said: 'Doesn’t believe in it?? It’s not the tooth fairy, it’s literally happening.\nBusinesses don’t generally increase wages for inflation directly but for what the job is ‘worth’ by what people will accept to do the job (which tracks with inflation). If he would have said he doesn’t believe in raises based solely on the cost of living then sure, it’s a shit thing to say but you can’t not believe in inflation lol'",
        "In response to 'At my wife's company the head of HR said this during a town hall, and that they would be delaying merit increases by another 6 months from the historical merit increase period. So effectively not meeting inflation and making employees wait 18 months for their increase.\nShe said she could see the motivation being sucked right out of the room. She saw performance of even the most motivated employees dwindle and overall attitudes towards the company decline, in less than a week. About 5% of the employees have left in the last 6 weeks.', a user said: 'It’s the most idiotic move as a business - recruiting costs a fortune, especially when you take into account loss of institutional knowledge and the time necessary to ramp up proficiency.\nSpending a dollar to save a dime.'"
