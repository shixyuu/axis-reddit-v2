Less pay means less work.', a user said: 'Someone asked why I haven’t left and then deleted their comment. There are a couple reasons. One is that I am still paid a decent amount for the work that I still do. Another is that the job has given me a ton of flexibility to spend time with my kids and my friends. The last is that I haven’t found anything better yet. I’ve applied at a ton of jobs but haven’t found one that seems like a better fit.'"
