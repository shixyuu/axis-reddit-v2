        "In response to 'It was a few things... but the primary reason was I ran into someone at dinner and I barely recognised them... then they went on to tell my wife about how we once spent five months of our lives working 18 hour days in a sea-container-office in Brunei trying to delivering two years of work before the end of the financial year.\nWe achieved the goal and saved the contract, and 500 people kept their jobs... which is good... but then he told me that the system was demo to the client and then immediately shut down and never actually used... so I reflected on the fact that pretty much everything I had ever done was probably discarded by now and I had spent twenty five years of my life working stupid-hard on things that didn't really matter.', a user said: 'I hope you’ve been able to find a healthier relationship with your work.\nNo employer is worth draining yourself for, and almost all work done by almost all people is inconsequential, but that realisation need not make you despairing and nihilistic.\nMy days of bending over backwards to get something done for an employer who\ncreated the conditions that require someone to bend over backwards\nare over, but I am still more conscientious than most people I work with. I do good work because I am a person who does good work. I do this\nfor me\n, not for my employer.\nThe mistake isn’t hard work, it’s expecting it to mean something to someone else.\nThe number of times that an employer’s appreciation of my hard work has been proportionate to the amount of effort I’ve put in is exactly zero. In the example you gave you worked your arse off to help your co-workers, which is admirable. But remember that your co-workers are not your employer. I’m glad they treated you like a human during a hard time, sounds like your co-workers appreciate you.'"
