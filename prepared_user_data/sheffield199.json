        "In response to 'But that's not quite what \"quiet quitting\" is supposed to be. It's doing the bare minimum stated in your contracts to try and be awkward to your employer. Most people will probably try to get to work a few minutes early so they're not late, but if you're \"quiet quitting\" then you would hang around outside until the very minute you're supposed to start. Then as soon as it hits 1700 (assuming 9-5) you walk out.\nYou're also not putting in an extra effort between those hours as well. You make sure the task is complete to the bare minimum, even if you know it can be done better (and probably would do it that way normally).\nMy job for example, I have to find total lengths of lines on a drawing. The typical way is to join up the lines and it'll give me a number. This can take forever if there's hundreds of lines so I found a way of using a spreadsheet to do all the hard work. \"Quiet quitting\" would be me not using the spreadsheet and spending much longer joining up all the lines like my colleagues used to do before I started. The task is being done but purposely less efficient.', a user said: 'Walking out at the end of the time you're paid for isn't \"quiet quitting\", or \"doing the bare minimum\". It's literally doing your job.'"
