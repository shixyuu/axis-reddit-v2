        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'I think people tend to misunderstand what 躺平 actually means.\nIt does not mean that you completely give up on life, it does not mean that you literally lie flat and not do anything, it just means\nletting go.\nHave you ever seen curling in the Winter Olympics? Think of yourself as the curler in the sport. You are just \"letting go\" of the puck. Stop trying to grab on to and control every aspect of your life. Stop trying to min-max your career, your family, your financial success.\nYou have done what you have done, and you will do what you have to do, but stop being obsessed with the outcome of your actions. Let the puck go and see where it lands. It is out of  your hands.'"
