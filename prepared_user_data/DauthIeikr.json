        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'Managers tried adding more to my plate yesterday. A day that I decided to come in on my day off to get some extra pay. Told them if they follow through im submitting my two weeks notice. Just wrote it this morning... Now they get to see what quitting actually means. PS the notice is more for my coworkers than the company, otherwise I just wouldn't show up anymore.'"
