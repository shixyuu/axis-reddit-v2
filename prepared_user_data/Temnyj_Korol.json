        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is just doing your job... working your scheduled hours, and clocking out after. So, yeah, I've been quiet quitting for my entire career because work/life balance is important, and my employer doesn't own me.', a user said: 'I'd argue that's not strictly true. While obviously quiet quitting is a pretty recently made up term, so interpretations are bound to differ, I'd say generally speaking, quiet quitting refers specifically to deliberately doing the absolute bare minimum you have to to keep your job. What you're describing is really more akin to just... Doing your job. You're not actively going above and beyond in the hopes of promotions and recognition, sure, but that's still putting in more effort than \"exactly how little can i do without getting fired?\"'",
        "In response to 'But if you're doing what's necessary to keep your job, how is that a form of quitting?', a user said: 'Because the point is you don't want to just straight up quit, or get fired, for whatever reason (presumably because the job market is fucked and most people can't afford to just quit a job without having another one lined up already these days). Hence the 'quiet' part.'"
