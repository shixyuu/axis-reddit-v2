If you want me to do more, pay me more—I’m not “quietly quitting”, I’m doing what you paid me to do. Maybe employees need to pay people more if they want them to perform more? I know, it’s a new idea—maybe even RAdiCaL!!! But hell!\nIt’s all just noise stirred up to distract workers from continuing to fight for what they are actually worth. Nobody should be profiting astronomically off the backs of their workers yet that has been happening forever and even more so in the last 40 years.', a user said: '“quietly quitting”, I’m doing what you paid me to do.\nI went to the store and they\nonly\ngave me what I paid for.  What is with corporations like Amazon and Walmart 'quiet-stealing?'   I paid for just a gallon of milk, and they didn't even give me anything extra, and when I went home, they completely ignored me!  I even called them after hours and demanded the eggs I felt they owed me, and they just hung up on me!'",
        "In response to 'Don't... don't you get notice before getting fired? Isn't that the norm? In my country you either get a month notice or if you are not needed anymore you get a month paycheck without working', a user said: 'Don't... don't you get notice before getting fired? Isn't that the norm?\nYes, in civilized, developed countries.  Unfortunately, the USA is no longer that, if it ever was.'"
