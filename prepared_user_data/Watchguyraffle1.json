It’s not “quiet quitting,” because like others have said, that’s so employers can feel like the victims. I never really maximized the minimum until I caught my employer screwing us over about lunch periods (that’s another story) about 6 years ago, but I really turned it on when I moved to Florida. That’s how everyone works there. It seems like the mentality of every Florida employee is, “that’s not my job.”\nEvery employer has valued my work because I’m not a liar and I get my work done efficiently. They say it’s because I was raised in the Midwest, but I’ve heard that ever since basic training in ‘99. I don’t win awards for being the hardest worker, but people know they can rely on me to do the exact thing they ask me to do.\nI finally fell into a job that pays me really, really well for the time I’ve put in in my career. And, my boss has the mentality of, “get your job done and I don’t care what you do with the rest of your time.” So, I’ve been extremely lucky since moving to California with my career and I’ve been able to really improve my mental health out here.', a user said: 'That.

Once you get used to it, I don’t think you can go back to smile fucking.'"
