I thought Quiet Quitting was when you just slacked way off or got a second job.', a user said: 'There is the real quiet quitting and then there is acting your wage.\nReal quiet quitting is doing almost nothing at work instead of quitting. Basically, I'm going to make you fire me because I'm going to do ten minutes of work a day.\nRecently, corporations have tried to redefine quiet quitting into employees being lazy because they will only work their job description, they turn their computer off at five, and refuse to take on three other people's job duties on because the company laid off half the department.\nBasically gaslighting workers into thinking they are assholes for have some very basic work/life balance boundaries.'"
