        "In response to 'Wasn’t this whole season filmed before Garrison passed?', a user said: 'I’m pretty sure the majority was, bc Christine got married in October of ‘23 and Garrison passed in March of ‘24.\nBut I’ve seen a lot of speculation that they had to go back and replace footage which might have contained Garrison, and that replacement footage was shot after March of ‘24.\nObviously I don’t know for sure that happened, but Garrison was very openly critical of Kody in the season prior, and his leaked last text indicated he was also not thrilled with the impact of the show on his family. I do suspect he’d probably filmed more in that vein and that content would only cause the family more pain while also getting many viewers upset for myriad (valid) reasons, so I can understand why it might be cut if it did exist.'"
