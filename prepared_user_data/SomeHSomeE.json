        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It's just the new buzzword for \"work to rule\", which has been a thing for decades.\nI don't like the phraseology around it, as it implies an action that shares similarities to quitting, when in reality it is people no longer willing to be taken for granted and go the 'extra mile' in return for shitty pay and rights.'",
        "In response to 'It's not even work to rule, it's just doing your job', a user said: 'That's what work to rule is.  Do your job and refuse to do anything extra.'"
