        "In response to 'The place I work has pretty terrible project intake and development practices. It's very common that discovery on what the client actually wants and what we have is left unfinished by the time mapping documents have been provided to me and I am expected to start building the process being requested. As a result I can pretty reliably predict that by the time we hit a product deadline, what it really means is we have one to several months of work left to do before anyone actually agrees it's finished.\nI'm often asked why I'm not more upset by this situation by my coworkers. I tell them simply that because I am salaried, I technically do not get paid to finish projects. I am paid to work on them. And since finding out that the two people I am training make more money than me while not even being 1/10th as skilled, That's all I do. If the project completes that's awesome, but otherwise I have no real motivation to try to hurry things along.\nIt's sad too because I otherwise really like my job. I\nwant\nto be invested in what I'm doing because I enjoy programming and I feel a great deal of satisfaction when a client appreciates how much easier I just made their daily tasks. All they'd really need to do is give me a decent pay bump and I'd happily stick around.\nBut they won't so the job hunt has begun.', a user said: 'Yep. Marx called this alienation.'",
