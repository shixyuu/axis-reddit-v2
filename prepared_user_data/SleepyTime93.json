        "In response to 'Just curious, what type of people are taking long term sub jobs? I see these posted and don't really understand who would take mostly the same work for lower salary/benefits. Why don't they just get a teaching certificate, it's been made easy enough?', a user said: 'Personally, I moved across the country and my new state has not made it easier at all to get a certification (or to transfer one in my case). Obtaining everything they want will take months of bothering people I haven’t spoken to in years and hunting down data that may or may not exist anymore.\nNot to mention, I’m ready to get out of teaching, and if a job offer comes through I’ll feel a lot better leaving a temporary post than a permanent one.'"
