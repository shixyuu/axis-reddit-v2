How the fuck is that one for you? Pay people appropriately for what they do, don't criminalize not working extra for free.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'Unless I can log tasks that I perform that are not in my job description, and then demand extra pay for them, I ain't doing a fuckin thing more than what is in my job description. And when they put it all in the job description so that people can't demand more pay or say that they're not gonna do things outside of the job description, then they lose their workers for underpaying them. Fuck that shit'"
