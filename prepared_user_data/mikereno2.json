        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'There’s a rumor that they’re potentially having us coming in 5 days a week again starting next year. Even though we’ve set records for sales and we’ve always expressed a desire for more flexibility with our hybrid schedule (2 days in office, 3 at home)About 25-35% of the office of 30 reps is now actively looking for new gigs. Take note if you’re in a leadership position. Avoid pissing off your entire sales staff with rigid, idiotic, counter productive  policies to avoid an office revolt. It can cost you a lot of money.'"
