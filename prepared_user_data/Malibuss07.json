        "In response to 'Thank you. Came here to say this. This is some corporate PR bullshit because people are starting to realize that just doing your job is okay. You don't have to sacrifice your life and happiness for an employer that doesn't give a fuck about you. And you certainly shouldn't go \"above and beyond\" without compensation.\nIf you are career minded and want to do more in hopes of advancing. Great. You do you. But just doing your job because you need income is also okay.', a user said: 'In public accounting, when you're up for promotion they love to say you should already be working at the level you're being promoted to.\nWhile I was still a monkey in the system doing just that for a time, I didn't lose sight of the fact that for almost an entire year the expectation was that you work up to that level, but not get the pay associated with that level.'",
        "In response to 'And then the monkeys at the higher level are incredibly desperate to underreport hours while doing more work on engagements than last year\nPublic accounting really is a hilarious world. Still love that EY acts like they only did performance cuts during 2008 and never laid anyone off', a user said: 'Don't even get me started on the reported hours. My biggest gripe with the accounting profession as a whole is that they're always willing to give a discount and undervalue their time. Then they wonder why per hour they'd make more at McDonald's.\nLawyers act like they're giving you an insane deal when they cut their fees by 10%.'"
