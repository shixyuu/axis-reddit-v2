Still insane though', a user said: 'How can anyone possibly think that? Does he think he's a magical exception among evil unions? Or that there was some kind of downside about the UPS union that exceeds having free college on part time employment? And he just dodged a bullet somehow?\nHow can he admit he's a hypocrite and still keep believing the wrong thing? What?! It's one thing to know better but still do wrong; it's another thing to do better but still believe wrong. While admitting it. How does that experience not automatically change the belief by proving that it's wrong?\nDid he eat a bunch of lead or was he just raised in the republican cult?'"
