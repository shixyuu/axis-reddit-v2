        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'I have coworkers who do this still and they are in their 30s. I get a chuckle whenever they start checking their emails from home or have it on personal devices. I think I'm the only person my boss doesn't reach out to about things because she knows the best answer I give is \"We can talk when I'm back in the office.\"\nPrevious boss before her didn't like when I gave that answer. She was not happy when I refused to help with a work problem while on vacation. Did I mention myself and my coworkers are hourly?'"
