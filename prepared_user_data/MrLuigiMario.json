        "In response to 'After being away on the east coast for many years after moving there right after college, it was a shock to return here and see the excellent work-life balance here.  It was something I never knew out there where not only were the work days long, the long commutes added onto that.\nHere, people start cutting out mid-day on Fridays and no one thinks anything of it.  That's just one example.  And the pandemic made all of this even more pronounced with the WFH.\nI love living here now.', a user said: 'I had a client who schedules meetings for Friday afternoon. I let him do one. After that I declined the rest.\nAin't no one got time to have a meeting in the office at 4 pm on a summer Friday.'"
