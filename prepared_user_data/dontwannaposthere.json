If your employer then starts to add more duties to your role, then you should be compensated for the additional workload.\nEmployers have been taking advantage and not been compensating workers for extra duties for years and now it's starting to show.  Every time you ask for a raise they turn their pockets inside-out with a litany of excuses.\nI think the term \"act your wage\" is great!'"
