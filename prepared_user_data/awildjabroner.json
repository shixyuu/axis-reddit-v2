Additionally, the unhappy employee could share with the boss all their hard work and productivity and cite examples of how they’ve positively impacted the company. This conversation could result in a promotion, raise, internal lateral move and higher bonus.\n​\nLOLOL *could* result in a promotion, raise, internal/lateral move, and higher bonus!\nOr it could resolve nothing, result in you being labeled a troublemaker and ostracized or retaliated against. Or it could change absolutely nothing at all leaving you in a position of unhappiness, unfullfilled and leaving money on the table elsewhere.'"
