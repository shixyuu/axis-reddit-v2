Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'the fact that they're trying to spin doing your job during your allotted work schedule and not going out of your way to do more than that as passively \"quitting\" is laughable. you'll always have people that want to excel and will push themselves to do more and take on more without any additional compensation, but those are the ones who don't\nget it\nyet.\ni used to be like that. making $25,400/yr, 45 hour work week minimum, at a store doing $42,000/mo., and honestly, that's when my life started going to shit. i'm so glad i realize it now and didn't waste my entire life working there like some idiot eager beaver.'"
