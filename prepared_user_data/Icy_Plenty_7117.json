        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'I find it shocking (I’m aware it’s a thing but it blows my mind) that non management employees have to do work outside of work. I grew up in a blue collar household and I’m a blue collar worker myself. I’m a CNC Machinist, I make parts for medical devices and screws for surgery. It’s a good job for a pretty great private company, but I don’t know a SINGLE one of my coworkers that would do a single thing once we punch out. I mean, ZERO out of over 50 of us. In fact MOST of my coworkers would not just refuse but would string together a sentence of 4 letter words that would make a sailor blush. I guess the atmosphere is just different in a shop. Clock back in and work for overtime, sure. For FREE? On OUR time? Not a damn chance. Office workers NEED to normalize working hours being working hours.'"
