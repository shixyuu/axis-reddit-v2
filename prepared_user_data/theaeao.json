        "In response to 'The term \"quiet quitting\" pisses me off because it makes it sound like employees are doing something malicious when the definition is just \"Doing what they were hired to do\".', a user said: 'They never talk about \"quite firing\" when you underpay employees for years and cut benefits.'",
        "In response to 'That manager (Mike Judge / the director!) was one of the best honed characters in the film.', a user said: 'I kinda liked the other waiter. I swear I've met that exact waiter loads of times.'",
        "In response to 'Brian?', a user said: 'I was thinking Mike. That's why I go by Michael. But deep down... I know I'm that waiter. I've waited tables for exactly one day in my life. And I walked out. I will not be \"finger guns Mike\" who sits down at your table while taking your order.\nLike there was a moment when Hitler chose politics instead of art. I owe it to the world to pursue other things than waiting tables. For the good of restaurants everywhere. I'll stick to being the cool manager who flips his chair around before saying \"lets rap for a second par'd'ner. I dont like the policies either. No phones urghhh! Like what is that right? I want on the facetwit and redtubes! As much as I love social meets. You gotta put the phone away when customers are around. Corporate urghhh so not chill\"'"
