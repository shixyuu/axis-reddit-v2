        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Me male HL wife LL Have you reached that stage ? Quiet quitting not leaving because of kids or what not but just quitting on the idea of romance in your head letting go of the resentment for your own mental health  and accepting that she’s just a roommate now ? We had yet another talk yesterday about it which she acknowledged the situation made promises again and that night it was just heavy snoring, told her today that I’m disappointed that our discussion led to no improvement even after her promises she said but we both agreed to make efforts ( because yeah I turned LL4U after all this time) I told her it’s ok I don’t even want to talk about it, I’m not even pissed as usual , she’s snoring as I’m typing this next to me and i don’t even care i don’t want her anymore and the sad part is the idea of getting to this point used to scare me but now I just don’t care, I don’t even think I love her anymore just that I’m used to her.', a user said: 'Done this openly and honestly where I stated point blank, I’m not chasing, not initiating, not engaging in flirting or anything that remotely looks like intimacy or sexual tension.\nHer look was basically ok then carry on, that was the moment I gave up all aspects of any forfillment from her.\nI was gone after 12 months.'"
