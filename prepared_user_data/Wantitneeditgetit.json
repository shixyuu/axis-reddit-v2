        "In response to 'You didn't mention, they've used mass media to slowly convince people that violence is never the solution, producing entire societies of ambulatory doormats who will suffer any indignity lying down.', a user said: 'Violence is a bad solution though. Unless you can unionize and get enough people that the implication of violence is enough to force negotiations.\nLongshoremen in the USA have issues with their Union but hey their guys are eating good at least.'",
        "In response to 'Unionization isn't an alternative to violence. It's a reminder that you CAN be drug out of your house and beaten to death in the middle of the night. That's where unions started.', a user said: 'Not really the look you want to go for, it's the threat of economic violence where you refuse to allow an unjust company to profit.\nYou CAN cross picket lines, you know.'",
        "In response to 'Found the corporate Reddit account üëÜüèº', a user said: 'Nah brah I've just been to places where they chose violence and it's pretty fucking ugly. Violence is pretty fucking hard to control once you commit to it.\nNobody gets violent until it gets past the point where it would have been less costly because the cause is personally too fucking high.\nHaving it organized is barely better than a popular uprising. For every Maidan there's a hundred Arab Springs.\nIf you're just interested in keyboard posturing though you can act like they've already taken away elections and dissolved the judiciary. Don't get me wrong, if you're in the USA it's close but definitely not there yet.\nIf you're in a non-US nation, get real bud.\nOr you can pull a Marios Brother yourself if you really, really, really believe that we're at that point but you're most likely hoping other people will pay the cost for your ideals rn.'",
        "In response to 'Now I am positive this a corporate Reddit account\nEdit- 13 day old account trumpeting corporate interests smh', a user said: 'I feel like you go through life experiencing that a lot.\nNah bruh, I'm just an adult in the room.'",
        "In response to '[ Removed by Reddit ]', a user said: 'Paradox of tolerance and whatnot.'"
