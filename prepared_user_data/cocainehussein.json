        "In response to 'I swear, everyone knows the same guy.  Seems like every single adult above a certain age knows a guy who was so desperate to work at a particular place that they cleaned it for free for months until they got hired.\nEither:\nThey're all making it up\nThey all knew the same guy\nThere are an unexpectedly large number of people who are a unique combination of dumb and desperate.\nReality check:\nMost places won't let someone handle a broom for them unless they're employed.  Liability issues\nMost places will kick out the person who arrives with a broom to start cleaning\nReally bad PR\nLiability issue\nThe guy who starts doing that risks getting a trespass warning.', a user said: 'There used to be a homeless guy who would go around and sweep at the gas station I worked at. Even changed out the trash. Mainly because he wanted to dig through the trash without being chased off. And staff was usually bare-bones as it was, so they weren't going to complain about the extra help.\nAnd if that's not indicative of the current state of the US as a whole, I don't know what is.'"
