It's doing your job as contracted. It's called \"work\".\nGoing above expectations is boot-licking, going below expectations intentionally is a protest/strike.\nExactly meeting expectations is \"working\".\nThere's nothing special, either good or bad or from either side, about working to expectations.\nIt is not a fucking protest.\n(To be clear, I'm NOT including any unwritten expectation of going above and beyond.)'",
        "In response to 'Throwing insults and animus at other workers is part of why you'll never be part of anything important. You'll just rage on the sidelines while the rest of us understand that when we disagree we can have a conversation and find a common ground to work on improving both our situations. You'll be hiding behind a tree calling us names and going nowhere.', a user said: 'I'm only taking issue with calling it \"protest\". The issue is if you normalize the thinking that working normally rather than \"exceeding expectations\" is a form of protest then \"working normally\" becomes not normal.\nPushing the idea that it's a form of protest only works in favor of normalizing \"exceeding expectations\".\n\"Quiet quitting\" (aka working to exactly meet expectations) is the status quo. All articles treating \"quiet quitting\" is something other than normal is basically propaganda, even if you decide you want to call it a \"protest\" action instead of \"quiet quitting\".\n\"Working to expectation\" is NOT a protest action. A\nstrike\n(or even an intentional slowdown) is a protest action.'"
