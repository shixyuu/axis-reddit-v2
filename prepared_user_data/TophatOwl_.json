If you work 40 hours a week, you deserve a living wage, period.', a user said: 'Ppl that use \"unskilled work\" to justify paying ppl less than they need to sustain their life are scum. That being said, unskilled is still a valid description for certain types of work. Stocking shelves at a supermarket for instance. Its important work and someone has to do it, no doubt. And that someone shouldnt have to chose between food and heating. Nevertheless, it is work that doesnt require special skills so its unskilled work. Unskilled =/= useless or unimportant.'",

You dont have to go above and beyond and youre not lazy if you dont. You both signed up for you to do x work and you dont have to do a single minute more. But then you also cant be surprised if you get passed over for promotions and pay raises. Do be aware tho that just because you do more than is required doesnt guarantee a promotion or pay raise either.'"
