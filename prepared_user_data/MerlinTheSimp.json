        "In response to 'That isn’t quiet quitting that is doing the work you are paid for. As a teacher I bring 100% during the school day but the moment my contract time of 4 pm hits I’m done and will not bring work home. Please don’t normalize unpaid overtime for teachers', a user said: 'Your first sentence literally defines quiet quitting. The whole premise is that you quit doing all the extra work you don't get paid for, including non contracted hours, unnecessary admin, etc. It's meant as a form of protest against the constant exploitation of workers.\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of the job and individual schools' requirements, teachers will mostly struggle to quiet quit successfully. We still have deadlines to meet, conferences with parents to attend, behaviour to manage, etc. It's not particularly fair, especially given how we get treated by students and parents alike (at least in middle to high school setting), which is probably why the attrition rate for teachers is so high.'"
