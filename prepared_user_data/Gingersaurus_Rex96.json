It’s a pedantic attempt at gaslighting by the rich and corporations to make us work harder for less.'",
        "In response to 'they have been quite quitting for decades now. this is at best the willingness to talk more openly about it, instead of everyone knowing but still pretending like they are actually working all the time.\non the \"upside\" just sleeping at work \"because that is how hard you work\" is sort of normal.', a user said: 'At least they’re starting to talk about it. Work is literally killing them.'"
