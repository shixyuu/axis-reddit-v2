        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Update: wow, the support!  Thank you all!\nWill now only refer to this as \"Just doing my job\"\nStarting today, I quit working for free.  I won't manage the school food pantry, sew for students or school programs ( uniform alterations, letter jackets, CTE jackets, prom dresses), work the gate or track meets, cover hall duty for others, support fundraisers, sponsor or coach teams, provide snacks to students, participate in staff potluck meals.\n I will arrive 2 minutes before my designated duty time and leave 2 minutes after hours.\nI will take off every Friday to help my family, and take off every PD because I have yet to attend a worthwhile PD (I have only been teaching since 2001, a valuable PD is unlikely to occur in the next year).\nI have 80+ days of leave accrued, and I will leave as few on the table as possible. \nThere is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.', a user said: 'My district has a number of police securing events as wild/rambunctious as orchestra recitals, at overtime rates as high as $80/hr.\nNo more freebies.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: '30 to 40% of one of my classes, after researching what’s needed to have a C level (CEO, CFO, etc) job, think they will accomplish this in their 20s. Most but not all struggle to even attempt half the work that’s assigned.'"
