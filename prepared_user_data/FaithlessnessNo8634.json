        "In response to 'If she truly still believes the crap the AUB preach, itâ€™s no wonder she sobs all the time. The heaven you go to is based on how many wives your hubby had. You need a min 3 wives to get your own celestial kingdom. Kody was doing just fine before he met Robyn. He was on his way to his own little slice of heaven. When Christine left, he still had 3 wives and could still have his own place in the stars. Then Janelle and Meri left.  Now thereâ€™s no place in heaven for Robyn - unless she dumps Kody and gets a new hubby, or she finds a few new wives for Kody. We know thatâ€™s not going to happen. So knowing sheâ€™s lost her entire afterlife is the reason sheâ€™s so upset and wants Kody to get on better terms with the ex-wives. She doesnâ€™t want them in her life - she wants their money, and she wants a ticket to a great afterlife.', a user said: 'This makes sense now as to why he is changing his tune on his religious support too.  He , conveniently, has changed his tune.  He wants to make sure he makes it to the pearly gates.  He still believes in the Mormon church though, right?  Didn't he say he would love his daughters to give it a shot because he had so much happiness there?'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'I have been a bit confused as to why everyone thought this was Robyn's plan all along.  For these divorces.  Robyn lives in another world and I truly think she thought the 3 wives were so enamored with Kody and their lives they would NEVER leave.  I don't think she ever wanted the women to leave bc they were her ATM.  I do think, she wanted Kody to live with her alone and she wanted to be wife No. 1 and have say over everything and everyone.  Now she knows it is over. It is why she is crying all the time now.  She knows, this is it.  Her and him.  Ugh.  I think she hoped at least that Janelle would take up some of his time.  Janelle, is smart and very good with finances  .   Hardworking, loyal , happy with a non-sexual relationship with Kody.  It is no wonder that Ms. Robyn was pushing her above all others and no wonder that she was Kody's pick as well.  They can't keep up this show much longer.  After the ladies find their way there is no need for us to care what happens to them.'"
