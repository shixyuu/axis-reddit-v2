        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! 🙏', a user said: 'If you intend to leave anyways just start saying “sorry I can’t”.  No is a complete sentence. If it’s not in your job description you don’t have to do it. Still be kind to others but rip off the bandaid. If they want to fire you for it, it will take a while to make that happen and you’ll likely be able to draw unemployment.'"
