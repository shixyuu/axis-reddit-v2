So they decided to setup a listening station for them to randomly connect to our calls and listen to what was taking so much time.\nThey admitted to only being able to listen for about 5 minutes because of how detailed/involved everything is, and how boring it was. Management being brought in from outside with zero understanding of what goes into the job tends to hamstring any department in any industry. How things work on paper; how things \"should,\" work? Fall apart as soon as your average human customer gets involved, and that's when it all goes to hell, rapidly.', a user said: 'Management being brought in from outside with zero understanding of what goes into the job\nhow do you manage something you don't understand'"
