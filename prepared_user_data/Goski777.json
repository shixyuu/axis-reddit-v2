I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'I know you texted which was good, but I feel you should have called as well. Thatâ€™s why there are two forms of communication to reach the customer. I have been in your position where they didnâ€™t respond  to texts and then I called and they answered right away. They are paying a decent amount in fees for these services and I feel every avenue of communication should be used.'"
