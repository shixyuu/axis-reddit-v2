        "In response to 'was crying the other day about they don’t enjoy being around witnesses anymore\nInteresting comment and thanks for sharing that. Me and the PIMI spouse have talked about this for a really long time now. Basically, that many of the JW relationships we have are very shallow and the people that we can choose as friends in JW Land have so many problems that is difficult to really be friends with anyone.\nJWs are either taking depression medication, alcoholics, mentally unstable or in many cases trying to survive while basically living in poverty. How are you going to develop close friendships if the people you are picking from have an endless number of problems.', a user said: 'I literally can’t believe the number of freaks and weirdos whom I allowed to suck energy and joy from me when I was in the borg.  Life is too short to spend time with people you don’t enjoy being around.'"
