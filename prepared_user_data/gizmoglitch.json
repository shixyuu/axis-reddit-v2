        "In response to 'Yes, got RTOd last month. Show up at 10am, go get some coffee and walk around the building for an hour, sit down and work for an hour, take an hour lunch break, go to the in office shitty gym treadmill for an hour, walk around for 30 minutes, work kinda hard for ~1-2 hours and leave between 3:30 and 4:30. It’s not perfect but I get my steps in and feel like I’m am at least partially sticking it to the man or woman in the case of my shitty boss. They definitely get about 2 hours less work out of me per day and I managed to dodge the round of layoffs that just hit yesterday. It’s obvious that they are just sorting salary by amount in a spreadsheet (that they barely understand how to use) and firing those on the top of the expendable list. Unfortunately they are getting close to where I’m at. We shall see……', a user said: 'Just got the RTO myself, and I'm planning to do the same. Get there at 10, spend an hour for lunch, leave around 3. I've spent years building trust and I always deliver, but apparently that means nothing, so I'm doing the bare minimum and making the most of it.'",
        "In response to 'I've wondered if anyone has just not gone in and kept working. I have a feeling most offices would take weeks to even figure it out and it would be the same as quiet quitting', a user said: 'I'm planning to do this as soon as it starts. Unfortunately I know there are people in my office that will point out my absence even though they're not in my team.'"
