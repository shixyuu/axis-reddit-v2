        "In response to 'I worked for a Japanese company at a regional office outside Japan, but it had about 50-60% ex-pats from Japan working there.\nNothing will put a stop to your thoughts of \"Japanese efficiency\" more than working at a company like that. You are 100% correct. You aren't allowed to leave before your boss, who can't leave before his, who... you get the idea. So everyone is just sleeping at their desks until they're allowed to leave.\nI also noticed someone using a spreadsheet, but adding up two columns of numbers with a calculator, one set at a time. It was... mindblowing. He was taking HOURS to do what was a 7 second job. When I asked him if he wanted me to show him a better way he said no, because then he wouldn't have enough work to do.\nI lasted a year, mostly because I left at my usual time every day without playing those silly games. I was told off by HR a few times but ignored them (I had young children, I'm not spending 0 time with them for no benefit).', a user said: 'So everyone is just sleeping at their desks until they're allowed to leave.\nhammocks under the desk are viewed as 'dedication'\noh, and tell us about the fax machines still in regular use'"
