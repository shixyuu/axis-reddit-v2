        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Vivek Ramaswamy 'quiet quitting' his campaign? It sure seems so. [External Link]: https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ramaswamy-2024-presidential-election-campaign-rcna131919', a user said: 'Ramaswamy has done literally nothing but expel a lot of hot air spouting strategies for executive communication available on any training platform.  He does not understand any issue.  He does not have a plan.  But he wants to try and smile and fake his way to VP.  The only positive is that he’s not likely to be picked as Trump’s running mate.  Trump likes loyal, but not publicly humiliating yourself as Ramaswamy has done several times.'"
