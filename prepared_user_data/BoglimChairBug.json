        "In response to 'Two points.\nCompanies used to reward going above and beyond.  They used to promote from within and give decent raises and give bonuses.  I don't know what happened to promotions, but the money dried up because of trickle down economic policies.\nThe second paragraph also applies to unions.  A company is formed when a group of people pool their resources to make more money.  When it forms a company, America bends over backwards and praises them as \"Job creators\" and shovels money at them (Tax breaks, tax incentives and subsidies)  When a group of workers do it, it's called a union and America demonizes them.\nI usually hate the \"Both sides\" argument when it comes to republicans v democrats.  However, Reagan made it illegal for Air traffic controllers to strike, and Biden made it illegal for Rail workers to strike.  Yeah, there are a few differences on what occurred to get to the result, but the result is the same.', a user said: 'There is a YouTube channel I sometimes watch called A Life After Layoff (guy is or was a corporate recruiter) and he explained the lack of \"promoting from within\" companies go with now when that use to be the norm. Take me at my job where I am an assistant manager. If I am promoted, not only do they have to train me (lmao) in my new role but then fill my spot and train that person. If they hire from outside the company for the manager, they just need to train that person and hope I'm not pissed enough to leave.'"
