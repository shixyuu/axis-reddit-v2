        "In response to 'I got pulled over for expired sticker (maybe 2 years out of date). Not even sure how he could see me, but it was a couple hundred payable to the clerk and reregister. Didn’t even need to pay out of compliance years. You could probably do a cost/risk analysis on it and come out ahead.', a user said: 'My partner got pulled over because of my 2 year expired registration. (It’s a dumb story but I missed registration, had to go the office to renew and then the following year I swear I never got anything in the mail for renewal, the pandemic happened, and I let it go for 2 years because I rarely drive and I was living off of the high of skirting the system🙄.)\nI did the math and not accounting for the time spent going to DPS, the penalties, ticket dismissal fee, etc came out to be almost exactly the same had I been up on my registration ($4 difference). And to hedge comments about uninsured driving, I’ve always been fully insured, I just shit the bed with registration. I won’t do it again but if I was scraping by, I would 100% do it again.'",
