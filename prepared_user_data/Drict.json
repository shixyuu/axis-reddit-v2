It could lead to quiet quitting –the new term for just doing your job but not going above and beyond- or even quitting [External Link]: https://news.uga.edu/quiet-quitting-can-lead-to-burnout/', a user said: 'I get paid X to do a given thing, doing more doesn't get me more than X, so no, that is working to the letter. That is working to what I am paid to do and WAGE THEFT is the biggest form of theft PERIOD. Me putting in extra effort = wage theft IF I am doing things that are above my requirements, because it means I am not being compensated for my skills in that extra activity aka I am being underpaid unless I get that extra payment moving forward FOREVER.'"
