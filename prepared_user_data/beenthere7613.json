        "In response to 'Production bonus that no one is able to get', a user said: 'Production bonus that moves farther away as you do your job better.\nI worked in a plastic bag factory one time. It was a fast paced job, and the machines messed up all the time. The factory had one mechanic, and standing around was boring, so I watched what he did to fix my machines. After a few weeks, not only did I have it down, but my neighbors had caught on, as well. We were maxing out piece rates every day.\nI was a single mom, so I was super excited for my check. Mandatory overtime plus maxed out piece rate meant a sizable chunk of cash. I was going to work there forever!\nWhen I got my check, it was half of what I was expecting. They changed the piece rates without warning.\nI straight up walked out, yelling the whole way about it.\nAdministration called me in the following work day, with a check made out to me for the rest of my pay. They apologized, and asked me to come back. I told them thanks for the check, but I would never work for them, again. Then I went and cashed the check before they could change their mind lol.'"
