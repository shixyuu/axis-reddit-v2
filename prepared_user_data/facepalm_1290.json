        "In response to 'Just putting my two cents in, this is not my experience in grooming. The salon I work at is awesome. Everyone cares and no one is intentionally pushing people out, at least not anymore than any other job Iâ€™ve worked at outside of dog grooming. I even put a 2 week notice in, worked the full 2 weeks with nothing but positivity coming from the owner. She even hugged me and said good luck when I left, and ultimately welcomed me back with open arms when I came back. I know a lot of salons can be toxic, but there are good ones out there.', a user said: 'This is not the norm. The grooming industry is full of people who peaked in HS and actively try to make the salon a real life mean girls drama. I am many many many years in and finally found a salon I like with the only drama being from clients. They exist, but are almost as rare as unicorns.'"
