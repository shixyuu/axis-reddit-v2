        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'I feel like it is an overloaded term that leads to a lot of confusion.\nAs a software engineer I can technically do enough work to not be fired working from home by logging in, keeping the laptop awake, and doing about 1 hour of coding so I have something I can say I did in tomorrows meeting, and claim I was dealing some some gnarly bug if questioned. If I decided that this is how I wanted to work then I would absolutely call this \"quiet quitting\", I might as well have quit but I'm going to silently stop trying and keep the pay check coming in.  This is obviously toxic behaviour, and employers will not be very fond of you.\nAlternatively these days the term is abused to mean saying \"No\" to extra responsibilities when you're already doing your job at a pretty good level. If I'm working 8 hours a day writing good code to the best of my abilities and my manager asks if I want to give a talk to the other engineers on a recent project, or can stay after work to consult on some new projects then I am completely within my rights to say no. It won't get me fired, but it won't advance my career and will stunt my potential pay growth.\nThis latter form of quiet quitting is much more acceptable to a reasonable employer and infuriating to a bad one who horribly overworks employees instead of hiring sufficient headcount.'"
