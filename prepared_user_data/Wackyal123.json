        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It’s not quiet quitting. Once again, it’s the “generation label” trying to make it their own.\nIt’s just doing your job. Some contracts state you “may have to do more to get the job done” but ultimately, if you don’t see any benefit to doing over time or going above and beyond, it’s just doing your job.\nI worked my arse off in my 20s and early 30s until my kids came along, putting in lates and weekends just to get somewhere and now I’m 40, I can’t be arsed. If I fuck up, I’ll stay late to fix stuff, but if it’s a schedule thing, not a chance.\nAnd particularly post covid, my wife and I lost a lot of people to cancer and covid in 2020, including her mother. It gave me an appreciation of living that I’d probably not really had before, making sure you spend all the time you can with those you love and care about because one day they won’t be there.\nWork is just work.'"
