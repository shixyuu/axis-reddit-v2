        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'Regarding the \"other role\" they'd create for you, in terms of title, do you know what that'd be? Title/level can equal a larger pay increase elsewhere in a lateral move. If yes, I'd consider staying a little longer, even until Q1. If the answer is no, polish your resume and references (heads up) and look elsewhere while you're employed, and quit when you get an offer that's hard to refuse.'",
        "In response to 'The other role's title would be similar to my current one and wouldn't necessarily mean more money elsewhere', a user said: 'In that case, I'd update my resume and start looking/interviewing. A suggestion regarding the new hire: it's a small world and you might work with that same individual down the line in a different org, and they could be your supervisor or vice versa. It's happened to me. Maintain your work ethic and be amicable towards the new manager (it helps not to focus on their title but focus on being a team player). It will pay off in the long run.'"
