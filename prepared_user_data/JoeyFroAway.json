They live in crowded rooms with zero privacy with cameras, and lack dryers to dry their clothes after it rains, they wrote.\nOn working conditions, workers wrote they're \"treated like mules\" and punished for not being quick enough. They said they're exposed to dangerous pesticides without adequate protection, and their bosses are verbally abusive.\n\"It feels like we are in prison,\" .... \"They physically intimidate us, destroy our personal property, and threaten to send us home,\" the letter reads.'"
