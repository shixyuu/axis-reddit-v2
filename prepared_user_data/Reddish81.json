Definitely projection on his part.  For me, it was confirmation that he really had no clue who I was bc material goods donâ€™t mean much to me. Lol', a user said: 'When I said I was leaving, my ex panic-bought an apron and a mug with a picture of a Jack Russell terrier on them. And it wasn't even cute. Yes, an apron and a mug. I kid you not. He smashed a hole in the bedroom door when I expressed my disappointment because a guy I worked with had bought me funny JRT stuff and I'd been delighted. Yeah, that was a little toy one for my desk. From a gay man.'",

They get off on it.\nMy now ex-husband admitted in marriage counseling that this was part of how he tried to control me in our marriage. (The other part was essentially clinical passive aggression: agreeing to my face whenever I raised a concern, then intentionally doing more of what I had told him bothered or hurt me, as a way for him to feel more powerful.) I immediately dumped his sadistic ass.', a user said: 'Wow. I have no further words.'"
