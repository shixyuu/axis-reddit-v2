        "In response to 'Original Post: My cousin is SFPD and has the same take on the bikers. Are we basically just paying them 3/4 $billion a year to cry and quiet quit? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/uhdkr8xy39ld1.jpeg', a user said: 'There are bigger things to worry about than the bikers. Sure they are a bit of a nuisance, but I’m not so sure they are causing any harm. Please correct me if I’m wrong. I’ve only been caught up in one of these biker squads once. It was mostly dirt bikes and a few 4 wheelers. They should be given traffic infractions if their vehicles aren’t street legal but I’m not aware of any actual crimes being committed. That’s not to say they aren’t committing crimes, it’s just unknown to my limited experience. I think SFPD aught to be pushing towards a remedy for things that many of us have simply come to accept. Fentanyl addiction, mental illness, and homelessness which often tie the former together. Reduce that terrible trifecta and the city will feel far safer regardless of the dirt bikers and 4 wheelers. Sure, send them to traffic court or something but let’s not lose focus. Let’s prioritize our problems and find some consensus and address the high-impact problems.'"
