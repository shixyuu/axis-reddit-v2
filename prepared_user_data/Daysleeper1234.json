Also, if you are not totally brain dead, and have some motivation you can advance, get a better position and more $$$, I mean at least I did.\nBut my advice to people would be, do this only in highly competitive markets, if you live in a shit hole like I lived, you will just receive more work, and they will threaten to fire you if you slow down a bit. Moving to a western country and actually seeing companies fight over you, give you more money to stay and so on, is still something my brain can't still comprehend.'"
