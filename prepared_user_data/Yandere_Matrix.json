        "In response to 'Yes!\nNo one\nshould condone this treatment.\nThey transferred the manager at my office, made a very new hire take on the role (without even training her to do the position she applied and was hired for mind you) and forced me to train and support the new manager for nearly a year while not paying me for the overtime necessary to train/help her do her job.\nThey never said it outright but heavily implied that they couldn't promote me because of my nationality (as a foreign passport holder).', a user said: 'My wife used to worked at a lab and she was great at the job well enough that they had her train a few people. All the people she trained was promoted up but her and they still came to her for help as she knew what to do. When she asked about getting a raise and getting the promotion they told her they couldn’t because  she wasn’t qualified even though she was apparently qualified enough to train the new managers. It sucks.'"
