Fine, make stupid, expensive mistakes because you don't want to listen to the olds tell about the four other times we tried the same thing. Don't care anymore, I guess they they can figure it out for themselves. Or not. Whatever.', a user said: 'I have more experience at what I do than anyone else at my company. And I am not allowed to do it. Instead I'm in an administrative position, because being allowed to do what I do would be threatening to the younger people. I got a negative review for not being proactive enough about my shitty administrative job where I'm not allowed to do anything. So I was blunt and said that I agreed because I hated my job.'"
