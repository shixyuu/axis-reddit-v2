        "In response to 'I’ve always wondered why there hasn’t been a trend of companies popping up in Japan offering better work life balance for their employees. You would think it would be a sure fire way to grab yourself hard working and loyal employees, and probably good press? I don’t know, I know it’s a different political climate in Japan but I’m surprised that hasn’t become a movement yet with the older generation retiring and the world becoming more connected.\nI’ve always thought Japan sounds like an absolute utopia besides their work culture. If it weren’t for that, it sounds like actual paradise.', a user said: 'Had the same thought going through these comments. You’d think  some younger gen x or  millennial run Japanese companies would just have a boss that decides “I may work late, but I want you to leave at 5. That’s the culture I want to instill here. I want you to be productive in n the hours that you are here though and it’s important you hit your quotas. If the works done, then the works done.”\nI mean in the us the tech companies didn’t used to have the ping pong tables and free espresso machines until Silicon Valley decided it was a culture change to attract the best and brightest coders…you would think SOMEONE in Japan would zig when the rest of businesses zag and everyone’s unhappy.\nAnd as you said, amazing country otherwise. Just came back from a magical 2 weeks there'"
