        "In response to 'I unfortunately worked with a malicious boomer who was actually “slow working” and was rewarded for it because she liked to eat at her desk and try to “work through lunch.” She was simply stalling to build up her time on the clock but the owner deemed her a harder worker, which she wasn’t, because of her constant presence at her desk.', a user said: 'Seen it before in the tech field as well. Owner of a small company walks in the dev pit and wonders why all the developers aren't typing away furiously, wants to know why they're not working. Doesn't like the responses, sees that someone has headphones in and accuses everyone of \"clock watching\" and fucking around. Come annual review time, bonuses are paid to the support team, but not the dev team because they \"don't work hard enough.\" Yeah, no wonder turnover was about one person every 3 months.'"
