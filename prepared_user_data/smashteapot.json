        "In response to 'This perfectly describes my divorce. For YEARS I asked by ex husband to address “XYZ”. In the few moments he didn’t get incredibly defensive (or aggressive about it) he appeased me and said “sure sure”. \nI begged, I cried, I screamed, I pleaded. Could not get any meaningful change. I was explicit in saying that should this continue, I will eventually leave him over these behaviours. We went to therapy. So fucking much therapy. Nothing changed, so quietly I stopped engaging. I focused on myself, only. I took care of myself, only. I stopped asking, complaining and begging. He was SHOCKED when I left him. Cried to anyone who would listen how he had NO idea this was coming and how could I so cruelly blindside him like this. Like were we even in the same relationship?', a user said: 'I find this interesting because there are a number of crucial psychological faculties that appear to be quite uncommon in the general population.\nTo name a few:\nSelf-awareness and understanding of how your own words and behaviour impact others\nUnderstanding the long-term consequences of your actions\nUnderstanding of actor-observer bias, e.g. \"she nags because she's just a bitch, but I only nag when it's important\"\nUnhappiness in relationships would likely trend downwards if everybody had a better baseline of emotional intelligence and self-awareness. All kids should be taught about relationships in school.'",
