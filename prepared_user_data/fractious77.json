I'm not proud to work at my current company (quite the opposite) and my boss thinks he's paying to make me his slave.\nBut I was looking for tips on how to start quiet quitting here on Reddit and I could only find old posts. It seems like it's not a thing anymore. Is quiet quitting dead? What have I missed?', a user said: 'I love how corporate America has created a self fulfilling prophecy in the form of the term \"quiet quitting\".  They were upset that a small percentage of their underpaid employees were not working as hard as they thought they should have been (despite productivity levels having gone up drastically since the 70s and continuing to go up), and gave it a label so they could whine about it.
