I've personally never encountered any issues when I've had to do such deliveries, but anxiously hold my breath every time nevertheless due to the potential for all manner of last-minute shenanigans.', a user said: 'I once had a minor try to order beer.  Once they refused to show an ID, I immediately left and went straight back to the store.   I will never do an alcohol order ever again.'",
        "In response to 'You're already doing one of the easiest jobs easily available. You never know the full situation. Why not do your job and exhaust all options of contact before canceling the order and writing a wall of hate? Be a better human.', a user said: 'The dasher waited 5 minutes as well as tried to communicate with the customer. There are other orders that need to be delivered and with being a alcohol delivery, it can not be left unattended.\nThe customer knew the order was placed.  The customer knew a code was needed to get into the community but did leave instructions on how to get in.  I am willing to bet the gates never opened during the 5 minutes so the dasher could not slip in.\nI don't see anything wrong with this.  Other people are waiting on orders, it is not fair someone has to wait longer because this customer could provide the proper info.  I hope the driver got their half pay for this.'"
