        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'That was well explained. I followed and agree.\nIf this was a general contractor and you paid them to do a job last year for $10k. And this year you want the same job done again, and he comes back and says “I had to raise my prices by 5% to keep up with inflation” and your response was “nah I’m going to pay you the same as last year for the same job”… they would say no and move on. Or they would tell you they can meet the same price but will be doing 5% less work. Seems fair. Capitalism and a free market dictate that.\nBut replace contractor with worker and the customer with their corporation… suddenly it’s quiet quitting when the worker chooses to do 5% less work if they aren’t getting paid their fair increased rate.'",
        "In response to 'Recently, many major corporations have started to use the term \"quiet quitting\" to refer to employees whose productivity remains consistent\nI don't think quiet quitting means this.\nI thought it referred to only doing the bare minimum, or only doing the job as described precisely in the job description.\nFormerly known as 'working to task' or 'work to rule'', a user said: 'I wouldn’t give my plumber a bad review if they performed the task as described for the agreed upon payment, not would I expect them to do anything more than the agreed upon work.'"
