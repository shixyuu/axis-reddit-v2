By the way we're normaling the distrubution\"\nWell it's not objective then, if only the top 5-10% of workers can achieve a 5', a user said: '“Look, we keep specifying the review criteria, but they keep EXCEEDING IT!\nAre we just supposed to promote peoples and give them raises when we have record profits? How are we supposed to afford our new yachts?\nThis is madness.  We need to artificially modify the review results or my villa in Tuscany is going bye-bye.”'",
        "In response to 'Exactly. Managers need to prove to their boss that they are working by firing people & having constant 1v1’s reprimanding them for insignificant things so it constantly has a steady workflow.', a user said: 'It’s all vapor ware and “feelings”. A business could explode, quadrupling sales and raising profits by 2 or 3 times.   Managers could promote everyone and double the work force.  Owners will still question whether John should get a raise just because he went from working as a cog in the team to running his own team of 6 new cogs.\nA 6 month employment isn’t a long time.  It doesn’t “feel” like John has earned his promotion yet.'",
        "In response to 'Yup, because we all know YOUNG workers are CHEAPER than people with experience.  It's all part of The Plan.', a user said: 'Which is hilarious, cause most of the time it costs more to replace than to raise.'"
