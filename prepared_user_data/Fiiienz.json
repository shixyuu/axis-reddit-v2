I was top 5 packers every week would get complimented on my ability by management but then soon after I was getting harassed about my breaks? Nothing had changed within the last year of my employment except me becoming better at my job but they insisted I was taking 25-30 min breaks and thatâ€™s not not true at all! my breaks end at a curtain time and I always leave break at that curtain time.'"
