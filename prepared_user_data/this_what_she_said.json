        "In response to 'Original Post: \"Quiet Quitting\" is a bullshit gaslighting term. Don't let it become an acceptable term [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/fwj0foce59k91.jpg', a user said: 'In Germany, this is standard. We have work contracts (for every single job, there is a work contract) and people will literally tell their bosses that if some duty isn’t listed in their contract, they won’t do it. Lots of people have a work cell phone that is their only form of communication with their company. Work Calls are not answered off hours, but it’s also because bosses almost never call you, unless it’s an actual emergency. Fortunately, unions aren’t necessary in most commerce because laws protect employees almost more than the companies. If I keep my end of the contract (show up on time, work my paid hours, and perform my duties), I can’t be fired.\nEdit: clarity'"
