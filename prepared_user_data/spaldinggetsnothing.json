        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'The term is a misnomer started in a TikTok video that went viral and was picked up by the media. It is actually a concept called Work to Rule which is the concept that you just do the bare minimum for what you are paid to do and do not go above and beyond. In the US, though, work culture has been formed to expect employees to go \"above and beyond\" and we as workers have been conditioned to grind and do the most. People are discovering that all that hard work and sacrifice is only getting us more work and no more pay. Now that people are just doing what they are paid to do, corporations and businesses are panicking because they are losing productivity and the free labor they are used to having. We are all saying, no. We aren't working for free anymore.'"
