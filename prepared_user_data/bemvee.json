        "In response to 'My bosses pulled this same shit with me, the plant manager, department supervisor, and HR.  They tried going full fucking SS intimidation tactics right away.\n\"Do you really like working here?\" \nAnd: \"We expected more from you upon your return.\" Me: \"Why?  Are there complaints of refusal of jobs?\" Shit like that.\nWhat it boiled down to was that I wasn't being written. Up, handy way of keeping my union rep out, they were trying to scare me into working more, because I was coming back from a fucking back injury, and they thought they could scare me into pushing myself regardless of risk of injury.  After basically shitting on my supposed bad work ethic, I asked, \"are there complaints about my weld quality?\"\nThe PM says \"well no, you are probably one of our top guys in terms of quality.\"\nI tell you what, it lit a fire under me alright, to slow down and take as much FMLA as I could to avoid more injury.  Fuckers.', a user said: 'You know what takes a hit when youâ€™re overworked?\nThe quality of your work.\nHow is that not understood by management?'"
