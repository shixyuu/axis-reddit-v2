[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0xvxv41m8axc1.png', a user said: 'That is the very definition of Quiet Quitting.\nQuiet Quitting is basically doing the minimum to keep your job. Most employers don't understand employees who do this because typically in order to move up in the world, you have to Go Above and Beyond.\nBut when you've been passed over for promotions, it's difficult to maintain that momentum.\nEspecially when you figure out that it's mostly Who You Know, not What You Know. Just becomes depressing for people like me who are better at Doing than Networking.'"
