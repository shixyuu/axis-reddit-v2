        "In response to 'I’ve officially ‘quiet quit’ for 2 years now, and I still get recognition points, and the regular pat on the back. I do maybe 8 hours of actual work per week tops. I’m a manager, so I give my team time and space to do what they need and pick their own deadlines. I give absolutely no shit about anything at work. I leave most days at 3pm and no one has picked up on it. I thought I would have been fired or made redundant months ago - but alas, if the work is done, no one cares\nMaybe once every 2 months there’s some mediocre emergency which requires me to work a full couple of day - but I’ve only worked past 5pm once in 2 years. I’m at a big bank.\nPlease - don’t kill your selves at work. It ruins it for us lazy people', a user said: 'In a similar boat. I leave everyday around 4 no one cares. I focussed on my health over work in 2024z used the time to go for longer walks and also made sure i did not miss out on my family time. I feel so much better than being in the infinite rat race of promotion and bonuses. The reason I quiet quit was my company removed the bonus structure in 2022. Made me realise there was no incentive to go above and beyond anymore as it was just words in a random software with no positive value add to my life.\nI believe i have received far more bonus by getting to spend more quality time with family. Reading more books. Eating healthy losing weight. Also made me realise hiw the bonus structure was actually manipulating me to give more to the company than required. I still provide good value to my employer but I do not burn myself chasing a bonus.'"
