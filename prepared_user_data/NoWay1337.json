        "In response to 'Just curious, are you able to make the other fifty minutes actually worthwhile for yourself?\nFor a long time, I thought this kind of job was the dream. Now I've been there for about a year, and it's a soul-sucking nightmare. My days get destroyed because I'll have something like 1 morning meeting and 1 afternoon meeting, and I end up just idling away the hours in between. I usually just surf Reddit or watch Netflix. Best case, I'll get in a workout or read.\nI'm quitting soon to go to an actual job, where they're going to pay me more money to do real work. I don't know if it's just because it's been years since I had to do actual work for multiple days in a row, but I'm weirdly looking forward to it.', a user said: 'Personally I like to do chores in the downtime. Vacuum the flat, do the dishes etc. and get all the minor stressors out of my mind to be completely free to do what I want when I'm off work.\nEven though im back to the office now (by choice), this has really elevated my overall satisfaction and wellbeing because I am way more comfortable getting my chores done instead of procrastinating.'"
