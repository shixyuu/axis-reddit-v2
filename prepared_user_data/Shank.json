        "In response to 'There are millions of people who own a house and a newer car that are completely oblivious to what's going on out there. Many are shocked beyond belief when life happens and they find themselves looking at having to buy a house or a car.\nMany people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nA mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.', a user said: 'My wife and I make over $300K in a MCOL area and get frustrated any time we look at the market to see what it would take to upsize. There is simply no world where we can justify trading $2500-3000 PITI/month for something over twice that just for a little bit more house or a slightly more desirable neighborhood. If you want a bigger/nicer house in a better neighborhood, you're getting into the $7K+ range to start with. I'd rather take those thousands of dollars a month and put them to work somewhere.'"
