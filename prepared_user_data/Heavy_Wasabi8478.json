There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I tried it and failed. I’m trying again this year.'",
        "In response to 'Keen to hear a bit more, did someone call you out on not doing enough or your role was just too busy to do it?', a user said: 'No call outs at all. I’m just not made to not give it my all, even when to my detriment. I ploughed through my work, took on way more all while feeling largely unappreciated and going through serious health issues. All review scores each year have been the highest one can receive. I don’t know how to pull back. A lobotomy might be the only way lol'"
