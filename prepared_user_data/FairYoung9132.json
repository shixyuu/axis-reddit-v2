        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'I didn't quiet quite ... I just quit.. I was a born in JW my dad was a very high up elder... I live in Ohio and my family name is known all over the country. We were one of the poster JW families. I always had doubts since the age of five but I stayed in because of my family. After watching the ARC I Left for good. My dad past in 2015 my siblings and I found out my dad was a PIMO because we suspect was the CSA cover up and the free masonry in watchtower my dad uncovered.. he would only give us bits and pieces we found out most of this after he died. All this being said I didn't quiet quit I just stoped I call out the elders from my congregation for being corrupt as did my sister's dis as well we told the elders if they came after us there will be consequences we told them they better not smear our family name after calling them out face to face they have left us alone... For now .this was about 5 years ago. They have bothered us at all. I am so thankful of doing critical thinking and seeing this organization as a cult and getting out.this is just a little of my story hope you guys enjoyed it contact me if you want to know more'"
