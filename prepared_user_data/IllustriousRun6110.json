        "In response to 'Yup, I have experienced it. Think about the “leaders” (that’s what they like to call themselves) and the fact that they are all void of all emotion and want power and control. This is the result. Thank you Gen Z (on behalf of a Gen X’er)', a user said: 'He’s right. Congress collectively voting on their own term limits, audits, salaries, lobbyist regulations, insider trading regulations, etc… the constitution dropped the ball in recognizing the importance of separation of powers yet giving congress essentially the power of self governance. I’d even argue that power is what allows congress to benefit from collectively colluding with the “too big to fail” corporations that screw us over like this:\nhttps://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/jpmorgan-chase\nhttps://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/unitedhealth-group\nhttps://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/exxon-mobil\nIn fact, I’d even argue further the collusion is why no one ever seems to go to jail over any of this🤷‍♂️ let’s take a look at ol’ Nancy’s or Mitch’s portfolios and find out…\nThink they’re going to vote any time soon in favor of restricting their own self governance and power? Nope.'"
