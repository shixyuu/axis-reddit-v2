        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Because we are on opposing sides? Businesses that run on profit want to pay employees as little as they can for the most work to keep labor costs down, and employees want to do as little work as possible for the most money. We have attempted to find a happy medium (it still sucks), but unfortunately, employees only benefit with communicating frankly if the company does, and the company currently doesn't benefit from communicating frankly. The power imbalance between a business and a lone employee, even a union most of the time, is so severely slanted in the businesses direction its laughable.\nIt's a prisoners dilemma. We could all be better off cooperating, but because we can't trust the other group, we dissent to avoid getting screwed over.'"
