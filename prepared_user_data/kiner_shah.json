For you, making all this was fun and you didn't enjoy anything else than it probably. You probably were spending the whole day behind your projects. You also probably had a free and fresh mind when doing all this - no pressure that will demotivate you, upset you. If these points are true, you are very lucky. Most of people lack motivation to even get up from the bed, either they are burnt out or tired of doing something which doesn't create any value for them (no appreciation, no money, etc.). Many feel pressure due to different factors, enough to make them demotivated. Many people try to build something, some fail, either due to inexperience or lack of motivation or distractions. These may seem as excuses, but this is reality.'"
