        "In response to 'Original Post: New type of quitting discovered \"Quiet quitting is easy to identify; employees who are quiet quitters visibly reduce their effort and avoid going the extra mile. Soft quitting, on the other hand, happens quietly over time. Employees donâ€™t necessarily reduce their work output, but their enthusiasm fades, their curiosity dwindles, and their emotional connection to their work diminishes.\"\nThe cure is to lick the boot harder.', a user said: 'I dont see the difference in soft quitting and just working a job. I have never had enthusiasm or curiosity for my job. I go and give them my time and they give me money. If i could get the money and not work i wouldnt be there.\nWho the hell has emotional connection with their job? I mean that is the bs you tell people in an interview but no one actually means it.\nI guess i am a soft quitter!'"
