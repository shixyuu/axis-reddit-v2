        "In response to 'Because inflation can be caused by low supply. This is well established.\nIt most certainly is not.  Inflation is about the amount of dollars chasing goods, not about the goods themselves.  When technology improved and the cost of flat screen TVs went down, we didn't call that deflationary, because it isn't.  The natural increase of the price of goods isn't what inflation is.  That is established.\nSo it's about as reasonable as saying printing money caused inflation.\nWhich is incorrect.  Inflation is explicitly the amount of money chasing the same amount of goods.  We have massively increased our monetary supply chasing the same number of goods.\nI don't know enough about economics to know why one is more a cause than the other but acting like supply shortage couldn't cause inflation is ridiculous\nYou don't know enough to tell me why, but you speak as an authority to tell me that it is?', a user said: 'While that\nmight\nbe the technical definition, especially in the ludicrously stupid \"don't bother me with facts, just theory\" Austrian Economics movement, that's not how it's perceived, and more importantly\nit's not how it's measured\n.\nThe\nmeasure\nof \"inflation\" is \"prices increased year over year\", nothing more, and nothing less. People that want to turn this into metaphysics are just being obtuse.\nAnd it's\nabsolutely\ntrue that reduced supply, especially with inelastic demand, can and does increase\nprices\n. Indeed, that's the entire basis of supply and demand economics.\nInsisting it's not \"actually inflation\" because it doesn't fit a useless definition that is politically motivated really is not helpful.\nIt's absolutely \"inflation\" by every measure that's actually used.'"
