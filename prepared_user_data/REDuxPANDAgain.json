        "In response to 'I'm confused, could you break it down a little more? So if I'm 40 hrs/week one month, then 30/week next month, 25/week the next, and the manager gives a vague unhelpful answer for why, what should I do?', a user said: 'Speaking as a former retail manager who did the scheduling...\nI got ridden hard to make payroll goals and distributed hours as best I could.  People who were reliable (showed up) and worked (even a little bit) got hours.  If you flaked on shifts, I basically double scheduled your slot and would send you home first if there was a need to cut.\nI never cut more than I had to as corporate would assume that meant we needed fewer staff.  I think a lot of short staffed places over cut to look good on district payroll hours and shoot themselves in the foot.\nI wasn't the best manager, but I tried to do right by my people.  Never ask anyone to do something I wouldn't do myself and that includes not taking massive pay cuts for no reason.\nI'm just providing an alternative perspective but you're definitely owed an explanation if you're losing almost half your income.'"
