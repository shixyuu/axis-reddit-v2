        "In response to 'Teacher appreciation week is usually bullshit or insulting anyway.  Always damaged my morale more than helped it.  It was usually like being told that your friends organized a party for you and then barely anyone shows up.', a user said: 'I agree.  I don't need the bullshit \"appreciation\" gestures, I need to not have 30+ scheduled for my room with 28 seats, not be scheduled for nonsense meetings outside of school hours, or need to jump through BS hoops that everyone knows are BS.  Don't \"require\" XYZ for an evaluation meeting and then just chuck it aside when I spent valuable time doing it.'"
