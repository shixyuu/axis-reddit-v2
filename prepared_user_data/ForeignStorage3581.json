        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Amazon There's a movement not really just Amazon but work in general since inflation is going so high, people are just giving up trying extra or doing more hard work than what's necessary. Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'Fck amazon. Been here 4 months still haven’t given me my blue badge bc they “hired too many employees” I work nighttt and they keep denying my request to switch to day shift. I fking hate amazon. They are notorious for not giving a shit about their employees, and it’s 10000% true. Such a billion dollar company should be able to accommodate for us, but no.'"
