        "In response to 'For me, it meant setting boundaries. Deleting Teams and any company software from my personal phone. Not checking emails outside of work hours and on days off. Not feeling pressure and guilt from co-workers who are willing to fall on the sword by sending emails on weekends and at 11pm.', a user said: 'So.. Not subjecting the company to security risks by using non-controlled devices, not subjecting the company to liability or overtime by keeping to the scheduled hours in your contract, and telling co-workers to do the same?\nI am all for managing expectations. I dont have teams/email/apps on my personal devices, but I can be reached by my boss in an emergency with texts or calls. If it is possible for me to answer such an emergency call, then I will. If not, I trust my boss can handle it; they are pretty good at what we do. The system works without me because it has to - it wouldnt be a good business if it tanked when someone was unavailable.\nThis is the norm where I live. The boss is able to handle things, the business is not dependent on people that are not hired to be there at that time. Every day cannot be an emergency. If you are management/boss, you may get a company phone and be expected to jump in an emergency, and those are the people that get to call us peons because they are the only ones with the authority to sign off on overtime as needed.'"
