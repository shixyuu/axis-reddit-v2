[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'Nothing. They just invented a new name to make you look bad/lazy/irresponsible and shame you for not being their slave anymore.\nDoing unpaid work was always a mistake, people start realising that their employers never gave a single fuck about them and it never mattered how much effort you put it, you'll always just be a number to them.\nBecause capitalisms whole system is built on wage slaves bringing maximum effort while payed terribly, they're very afraid of workers suddenly just doing the minimum and need to create lies about how lazy and terrible those people are, to keep their workers from picking up that mindset too.\nBasically like republicans make socialism the enemy because they don't want to spent money on poor people. So they just spread lies of how the US would be ruined by socialism. People believe it and suddenly start fighting against socialism although they might even benefit from it.'"
