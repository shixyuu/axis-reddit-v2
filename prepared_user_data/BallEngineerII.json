        "In response to 'I did hear some people saying debates were outdated anyway.\nâ€‹\nThat being said, I do wish they're here in 2024, since Kennedy might qualify and, while I think he's a bad candidate, I would enjoy a three way debate.', a user said: 'The debates as they exist are a dog and pony show.\nA substantive debate would have to be spread over multiple evenings, multiple hours, each one focused deeply on a particular issue. But Americans largely wouldn't tune in to watch that.\nInstead we get two hours of candidates talking over each other, moderators refusing to enforce their own rules, and candidates only get 60 seconds at a time to answer complex questions that cover the entire spectrum of issues. It's just a sound bite factory and nothing more. Most of the candidates won't even stay on topic or answer the questions straight and the moderators do nothing to keep it on track.'"
