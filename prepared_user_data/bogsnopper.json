        "In response to 'Original Post: CMV: \"Quiet quitting\" is not only hypocritical & nonsensical, but the very existence of the term marks a deplorably unequal economy. Recently, many major corporations have started to use the term \"quiet quitting\" to refer to employees whose productivity remains consistent, implying that not continuously increasing one's output at work is akin to stealthily quitting one's job. This is, to anyone who wasn't born into the top 0.5% and then went on to become a CEO who never worked a job below $60/hr in their life, a ridiculous idea. The entire point of working a job under a capitalist system is that you are exchanging your labor for a contractually agreed upon wage. While the tenets of capitalism fundamentally require that you be paid less than your work is worth to the company, this CMV doesn't aim to touch on the fundamental inequalities of capitalism, but rather the bastardization of the capitalist system that Westerners in 2023 are forced to face.\nWhen a laborer agrees to work for an employer for a wage, the principles of ideal capitalism dictate that the agreement between the laborer and employer is mutually beneficial: the laborer is happy performing the required labor in exchange for the offered compensation, and the employer is happy reaping the profits of said labor in exchange for paying said compensation.\nEvery single nation employing this style of capitalism also uses fiat currency: currency which is inherently inflationary and will always reduce in value (at varying rates, but always tending towards a reduction in currency value through inflation). In the US, the proprietor of the global reserve currency and the most influential capitalist republic in a world brimming with capitalist republics, the rate of inflation has significantly exceeded the rate of wage increase for over a year now; that's not including the even further blown-out cost-of-living skyrocket nor the record-breaking strides in the efficiency of labor thanks to technology.\nIt has been shown time and time again that, while the economic stagnation brought on by the pandemic surely did inhibit the global economy, more than half of the increase in both inflation and cost-of-living in advanced Western economies has been solely due to greed-driven exploitation of global unrest by corporations who have posted record profits despite devastating drops in demand through pure price gouging and exploitation.\nThe use of the term \"quiet quitting\" betrays the not-so-secret key to maintaining profitability for shareholders despite negative economic trends: employers have always expected workers to sacrifice whatever necessary in their own lives for the increased profits of their already exorbitantly wealthy shareholders. For the past few decades of increased productivity and prosperity, this has been fueled by laborers' belief that hard work and blind dedication will result in financial advantages: work hard, provide more value to your company, and you get paid more: capitalism at work. Except now, we live in a world where even the most generous of incentivized bonuses still amount to a reduction in wages according to purchasing power.\nIf your wage is not actively adjusted for inflation, you are taking on a recurrent decrease in salary.\nTL;DR a laborer under a functioning capitalist society exchanges an agreed-upon quantity of labor for an agreed-upon wage. The economy under which most of the Western world currently exists has become vastly preferential of business owners and corporate elite through pure corruption, and the idea of \"quiet quitting\" is just a small yet potent example of how the wealthy have been actively and increasingly exploiting the working class for decades, inevitably trending towards record-breaking profits for the top 1% regardless of wider economic factors, and a consistent degradation of the wage, purchasing power, and political representation of the workers actually creating value.\nPlease change my view because, as a highly politically and economically educated person who was born into a problematically socialist society and raised in another, now living in the US, I desperately want to be able to support the widespread prosperity afforded under a capitalist system, but the US has already easily passed the threshold from capitalism to oligarchy.\nAs an immigrant US resident who believes in this country but can't vote, I desperately remind Americans that you're allowed to vote for someone who isn't a corrupt geriatric billionaire - please just stop watching CNN, FOX, and MSNBC, and maybe actually read a campaign platform or two. You have competent politicians, you just refuse to give them power for some reason...', a user said: 'I'm going to start with the disclaimer that your CMV is poorly worded and difficult to decipher.  You make a prominent statement about \"Quiet Quitting\" then go off onto inflation and cost of living and compensation for work provided, which are all different topics.  I'll do my best to change your view, but I'm not sure I'm heading the right direction.  All my statements assume a US job market.  I'll also not deny that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, and that most of the economic gains over the last 2 years have gone to the wealthy, but that just seems to be a side complaint of yours and not the main thrust of the argument.\nFirst, I'm not sure you're using the term \"Quiet Quitting\" correctly.  There is an old saying that says, \"Employees work just hard enough to not get fired, and companies pay just enough that employees won't quit.\"  While there is some truth to this, it is not universal.  However, it does outline the definition of \"Quiet Quitting,\" which is doing the absolute bare minimum you can get away with without getting fired.  When a company hires someone, an investment is made:  recruiting, hiring, training, getting up to speed, etc. all take time and money, and it represents a real cost to a company.  When someone is just barely performing, the company has to ask themselves, \"Is it worth the hassle and cost of trying to replace this person if I get rid of them?\"  Quiet Quitting does not \"refer to employees whose productivity remains consistent, implying that not continuously increasing one's output at work is akin to stealthily quitting one's job.\"  Typically speaking, most people start a new job with some sense of excitement and energy, eager to learn something new or be challenged.  Quiet Quitting occurs when that person becomes disillusioned and disengaged and their productivity drops to a barely acceptable level.\nAlso, there is a significant difference between expecting employees to care about their job and their customers and expecting employees to continuously increase their work output.  Every manager knows that there are limits to what can be accomplished in a day.  No one seriously expects people to increase their output forever.  There is a certain plateau that is reached in any job.  All managers want is for people to strive to reach and maintain that level of productivity and not continue in or return to the level of production you had on day 1 when you didn't know which end of the shovel to hold.\nHow you describe the work contract is also only partially true.  For an hourly employee your definition that \"you are exchanging your labor for a contractually agreed upon wage\" might stretch, but it certainly doesn't for salary workers.  A lot of companies and managers don't get this, so maybe your interactions have been with some people like that.  For salary employees and certain contract work, you are paying to get a job done.  If you hire someone to mow your lawn, you don't agree to $/hr, otherwise they'd go out there with a pair of scissors and take 3 days and charge you an arm and a leg.  You don't care how they do it, as long as it gets done.  If they have larger/faster equipment and can do your yard in 2 minutes or if they have smaller equipment and it takes them 2 hours, you don't care - all you want is your yard mowed.\nWhat you say about inflation can be true.  You use the example of 5% raises, but until the last 2 years, inflation has been pretty low.  For the past 20 years, it has been typically around 2.0 to 2.5%.  In 2020 it was 0%.  So in most years a 5% raise would cover inflation and also give you a bump more.  In 2020, the entire 5% raise would have been gravy.  But realistically, 5% is high for most people most years.  What happens in large corporations is that managers are told that their entire team is limited to 2.5%, but it's up to you who gets how much.  The manager then gives 2%-3% to average employees, 4%-5% to outstanding employees, and 0%-1% to the Quiet Quitters, in the hopes that they get the message and go somewhere else on their own and don't force the manager to actually fire them.  The average employees then keep even with inflation, the outstanding employees move ahead of inflation (and are encouraged to stay with the company), and the underperforming either suck it up or move on.\nFinally, and I think to the crux of your CMV, I take exception with the statement, \"Except now, we live in a world where even the most generous of incentivized bonuses still amount to a reduction in wages according to purchasing power.\"  I've never viewed myself as a corporate ladder climber.  I just come to work and do my best with a smile.  And when I see someone in my company with more power and more pay than I have screwing things up, I say to myself, \"If that's all the better you have to be to get that job, then I can't screw it up any worse than they can.\"  As a result, I make about 5x what I did straight out of college, which is about 2.5x even counting for inflation.  And I say that as someone who started out delivering papers for $75 a month, then moved on to manual farm labor for $100 a month, so I'm not part of the .5% and I've had plenty of minimum wage jobs growing up.  I'm living proof that hard work, good attitude, talent, and ambition can certainly take you a lot farther than just keeping up with inflation.  And I'm not alone.  I've had a lot of employees come and go, and the good ones definitely get better raises (typically double inflation) and better promotions (which usually comes with >10% raises, which always beats inflation).  I think what is missing in your viewpoint is that there is definitely limited room at the top and not everyone is willing or able to make it there.  I have a brother that will never be able to do more than work retail and entry level pay.  It doesn't matter how many years of experience he has, he will never work for more than entry level wages.  Some people will max out at a supervisor level or a middle manager level, and there is nothing wrong with that.  If you make $70k supervising a team of entry level level employees who each makes $40k, you've got a better deal than they do.  You shouldn't complain that someone else had the talent and ambition to become VP.\nSorry for the shotgun response - I tried to hit on a variety of topics mentioned in your CMV.\nTL;DR:  Quiet Quitting is not the same as maintaining a steady output, No one expects people to always and forever increase their productivity, they just want people to perform at a level they know people should be able to perform at.  Merit increases and bonuses can easily surpass inflation.  But that doesn't mean there's not an existing problem with how our economy is benefiting the wealthy at the expense of the poor.  In the hierarchical pyramid of corporate advancement, not everyone can always move up.  If there's a new opening for a manager but 10 people on the team, only 1 person is going to get promoted.'"
