        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'It actually doesn't exist. It's literally something the corporate class just came up with and is now trying to pretend is a real thing.\nFrankly, no one here is really impressed, but because our media is owned by corporations and delivered to us by millionaire news anchors, they are astroturfing the hell out of our airwaves with it in a pathetic attempt to shame us into working even harder.\nAt this point they are trying to get blood from a stone. American workers are maxed out and have been for decades. We don't have anything else to give, but the greed of our corporate aristocracy knows no limits and continues to try to devour everything!\nQuiet quitting is nothing more than American media gaslighting the workers, with a giant guilt trip from our corporate slave masters.\nIt's abuse, plain and simple, but at this point Americans are so used to the constant abuse that many of us, especially our older generations, have developed Stockholm Syndrome and will actually go along with it and help further gaslight the rest.'"
