        "In response to 'are you meeting your goals\nAlso your goals are nebulous bullshit related to our overall company/division success, not actual tangible goals related to your job specifically', a user said: 'Every company I’ve ever worked for has been in a constant state of defining and redefining their goals and responsibilities for each level so there’s always plausible deniability when you say you’re ready to move to the next level. Yet when they post new jobs, they seem to have an exact idea of what’s expected for that position. It’s all by design.'",
        "In response to 'That's simple. You just take the better offering. Their loss.', a user said: 'Yep. “We’re family at Globocorp” is a form of emotional manipulation to get you to do more work for less compensation. Families don’t have shareholders. Families don’t kick you and your siblings to the curb if it helps boost their stock. Every decision they make is an economic one and as employees, yours should be economically driven too.'",
        "In response to 'It doesn’t help that the article was written by a CEO lmao', a user said: 'This is amazing. It really recommends not applying for new jobs when you feel undervalued. That’s literally the best time to apply for jobs. You find out what your market value is and then tell your boss to either match it or you walk.\nThere is no such thing as a “merit-based” promotion or raise that isn’t already embarrassingly overdue. Talking to your boss and telling them how hard you work does NOTHING. The only language they understand is leverage.\nI tried for more than a year to get a merit-based promotion at an old job and was told I wasn’t ready for the next level. I then got recruited and came in with a competing offer and was promoted in 3 hours.\nThis article is straight up corporate propaganda.'"
