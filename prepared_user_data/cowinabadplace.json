If you have a farm, and you sow it, and it then grows and you harvest it, you still need to have somewhere to store it to be able to sell it. If you harvest it and have nowhere to put it, it just rots in the field. Fine, so you don't have anywhere to store it so you don't harvest it. But if you're not going to harvest it, why sow the field?\nI was very against \"defund the police\" but if the truth is that there's no work for the police to do, then we\nshould\ndefund them, no? They're making a pretty good argument here.'"
