I act my wage at work and if someone comments on it, I let them know. \"Can you move faster?\" Sure can't.  I'm not paid based on how fast I move. \"Can you answer the phone?\" Absolutely not. I don't get paid to handle customer complaints or handle staffing situations, and I don't get paid to be your assistant. I get a manager as soon as a customer looks upset and heads my way. I can't help them anyway and I don't get paid to.'",
