Not going above and beyond for your work is not quiet quitting, it’s acting your wage and doing exactly what you’re paid to do.', a user said: 'I always understood quiet quitting to be pretending to do work, while actually doing other stuff. Like, telling everyone that you are jamming out a report all week while you just chill, then on the last day cobbling together some slop. Had a coworker that basically said they were working on something for 6 months, then had a one page write up with a couple graphs at the end of that time period.'"
