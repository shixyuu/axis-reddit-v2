        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'This term is so toxic. No such thing as quietly quitting if you're just doing your job. Doing extra stuff and not being paid for it is absurd and should never be the norm nor a requirement to seem like a good worker. You want a worker to go an extra mile? Pay for that and reward work with money - it's the concept of a job'"
