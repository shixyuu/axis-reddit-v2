        "In response to 'I'm GenX. We were taught by our boomer and silent generation parents and early employers to go \"above and beyond\" for our employers and to eat all kinds of shit and abuse to be a \"good employee\".\nWe were taught that we were being 'given a job'. Statements like \"we picked you over many others...\" were said so that we'd feel grateful for the opportunity.\nIt's all one-sided bullshit that poisoned us. It was 1930s Depression Era thinking that had people beholden to their employers and strip employees of their actual worth.\nMore and more, young people today (Millennials and GenZ) are standing up for their worth, and employers are angry about it. I'm proud of these generations for refusing to accept the bullshit the rest of us were sold.\nIt isn't \"quiet quitting\". The only thing they're \"quitting\" is being party to their own exploitation, and there's nothing \"quiet\" about it.', a user said: 'GenX myself and I have no trouble going above and beyond, you just have to pay me for it.  Either OT or time in lieu...  You want me to actually answer my phone after business hours and be on call, that will be standby pay, with a call back charge if do call, thank you.  Otherwise after 5PM hits, I'll see you tomorrow and don't call me because I won't answer.\nFuck the dangling carrot of promotion, raise or bonus that never materializes...  because there are 7 or 8 other teammates also busting their ass, and we ain't all getting promoted...\nI don't even actually\nneed\nthe promotion if I just got paid for all the \"free\" labour I am expected to provide.  Get a job that pays OT you can make bank.\nOf course you know what jobs actually pay OT...  union jobs, and they are a dirty word to so many people, but I don't know why.'"
