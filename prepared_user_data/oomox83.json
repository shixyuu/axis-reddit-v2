        "In response to 'I work in a union shop, and when my supervisors piss me off I do\nexactly\nwhat I'm told. . . . . . . And\nONLY\nwhat I'm told.\nWorking as instructed still means you need to be instructed.\nI also regularly admonish new hires for working off the clock. They don't start paying us until exactly start time, so if you come in early, even if you punch in, they don't pay you until you were scheduled to start.\nI think this is a stupid rule, so when I get there early I sit on the conveyor belt that is required for work to happen and play on my phone. They can't turn the belt on if someone is on it, so if they want to start working they have to ask me to move.', a user said: 'I have had quite a few new hires over the years try to work off the clock and I shut that shit right down. The company doesn't do jack shit for you for free. Don't do shit for them unless you're on the clock.'"
