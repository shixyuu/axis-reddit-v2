        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'My employer sent out an article about it to all staff, but mainly aimed at management. It basically said:\nQuiet quitting isn't a real thing.\nSetting professional boundaries and having a proper work-life balance is important.\nIf you want people to do more than just what they're paid for, you need to give them a reason and do more to motivate them e.g. pay overtime, give bonuses and proper incentives.\nI kinda like my employers sometimes.'"
