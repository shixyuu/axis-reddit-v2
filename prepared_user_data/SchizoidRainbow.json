        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'You're not doing everything you were hired to do. Only the things that can be checked up on easily.\nFor instance, if I did this to my network engineer job. No more maintenance, software udates, document revisions, planning for future forklifts, resource utilization projections, optimizing, organizing, or monitoring. I will only respond to outages, and even then only those that I really have to. I have basically stopped working and am soaking a paycheck until I'm fired.\nIt is absolutely a painful thing to do to your employer. If you want to shiv them on your way out, leave a fucking rat's nest with everything mere days away from bursting into flames. All documentation is out of date and irrelevant so the next guy has to figure it all out from scratch. Byyyeeee! Woob woob woob woob!'"
