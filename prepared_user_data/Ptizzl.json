        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I quit a few months ago. I can’t handle it anymore. No idea what’s next, but I just needed some time with my kids over summer.\nBest decision ever so far. I’ve been camping and backpacking and traveling all over with them and it’s been so incredible to experience being a family man again.\nBut of course I’m wondering where I’m gonna get money. Luckily I have a healthy emergency fund… for now.'"
