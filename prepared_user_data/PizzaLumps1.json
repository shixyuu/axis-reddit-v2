        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'A coworker of mine \"quiet quit\" because he said our employer was abusive. He could never verbalize how they were abusive- they just were. He was so, so fucking toxic. Treated us , his coworkers like crap and put zero effort into his very easy, cushy prep job.\nHe never got fired so the whole last month before he went to school he did the bare minimum and fucked us over- not our boss. Us. He framed it like some sort of noble thing but he was just a lazy, entitled asshole with an inflated ego.'"
