        "In response to 'Hold up though, wouldn’t they un-ironically solve a lot of problems from teaching? Like a certain amount of comp pay each week, a sort of “prep pay” that you get added if you prove you were prepping students work extra hours after work? It would incentivize maybe a more burned out teacher, and it would give teachers who have been trying really hard but are getting burnt out fair comp for the work they put in. Even if it was an extra $200 tax free it would be a step in right direction, no?', a user said: 'Oh absolutely, but our union would have to negotiate that and I feel like every (3rd) year the negotiations get rougher.'"
