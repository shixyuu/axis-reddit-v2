        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. ðŸ’ª', a user said: 'Itâ€™s hit my store too. HR started fucking with shifts of staff they hired during the pandemic for new staff and we have lost a good chunk of those of us that stayed.\nThen there has been management changes because sales were so good that everyone up too got promoted. They havenâ€™t sat right and itâ€™s been really throwing a couple departments under the bus to focus on new strategies. Iâ€™m still holding onto my attitude because I love my current team and we all give a shit about our direct manager/supervisor but even we are getting to the end of our rope'"
