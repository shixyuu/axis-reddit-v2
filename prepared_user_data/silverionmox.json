        "In response to 'People who go above and beyond are the people who get promoted to the next position.\nThat's the myth, and to be fair it's a compelling one.\nThe reality more often is that you get to a position and then stop advancing, either from too-stiff competition at the positions you're applying for or because you're perceived as\ntoo\nvaluable in that position. At that point, it becomes more beneficial to go to a different company for better pay, or a perceived chance at upward mobility.\nAnd all of that ignores that some jobs don't\nhave\nupward mobility (small businesses) or people get promoted for reasons other hard work (kissing ass, nepotism, favoritism).\n\"The hardest workers get promotions\" sure looks good on a coffee mug, though.', a user said: 'some jobs don't have upward mobility (small businesses)\nTo be fair, those can choose to expand or just enjoy the increased profitability.'"
