        "In response to 'Original Post: Where Are the Workers? From Great Resignation to Quiet Quitting [External Link]: https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2023/09/27/where-are-the-workers-from-great-resignation-to-quiet-quitting', a user said: 'Most of the reduction came from highly educated men working intensive jobs more than 50 hours a week.\nI believe there is a generational shift happening culturally because men, especially in this cohort are likely to have partners that also work. With child rearing responsibilitiea being more equitably shared in the younger generations, something has to give.\nAnecdotally, I see that single, childless men have the most availability work extra hours and they are rewarded for doing so. Also, DEI initiatives disincentive companies from promoting men, so why should they put in extra time in those environments if they're going to be passed over.'"
