        "In response to 'What truly terrifies me about this generation is that they are the next workforce and they just... don't want to do anything. Like they are all so anti school and haven't realized that life is work, honey.', a user said: 'I feel like most upcoming high school students will graduate, realize making YouTube and TikTok videos and game streams is a lot more work than they realized (and a very hard gig to build a following within that is serious enough to pay rent), and eventually take whatever jobs are available to make ends meet in adulthood. Work becomes a matter of necessity, not passion. My local department stores and hardware stores are full of former students who did not care about school work, but are now working 40+ hour work weeks to support their kids, pay bills, etc.\nStudents who go to college right after or who have support from family may encounter this lesson  a bit later; they will have the advantage of being more selective with what jobs fields they apply for (depending on their degree), but will also need to be more competitive within a saturated candidate pool. It was that way when I graduated college a decade ago, and I had to work two part time jobs for 3 years before I landed a job applicable to my degree.'"
