        "In response to 'Same way they say \"WAGE PRICE SPIRAL!!!!\" even though real wages have fallen.', a user said: 'That's a myth anyway. One that just gets perpetuated because it's convenient to the large corporations.\nThe only way it can actually cause a scary out of control spiral, is if they raise prices by much more than the increased costs, since wage is only a certain percentage of overall costs.\nE.g. if they raise price by let's say 10% after increasing wages by 10%. This just raises profits since wages might only be a small part of why the price is what it is.\nEdit: found an article on\nforbes\nthat explains it better than I can.'"
