        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'So I have worked for people and also managed people. The worst company I worked for was after the pandemic when I had quit contracting and had been on £500 a day. This new company paid me £40k a year. I did exactly what they required in the job and the MD wasn’t happy and kept asking me why I wasn’t doing all the stuff he had seen in my cv and had seen me being tagged in articles on LinkedIn of achieving. He seemed to expect me to turn his business into something spectacular. I told him that although I was capable of doing that, I did that kind of output for £500 a day. For £40k a year I would come to work at 9, complete the tasks set in jira, take my lunch hour, run some reports and present them on the company templates and then I would leave at 5. If he wanted a senior member of staff to implement business change then he needed to pay for one and he wasn’t. He would get very frustrated so I left and I’m back in a position similar to what I was before and I know he checks my LinkedIn because I’m always being tagged into posts complimenting my achievements in the industry again. Employers get what they pay for. Don’t expect someone to bring their A game when you are paying C game wages.'"
