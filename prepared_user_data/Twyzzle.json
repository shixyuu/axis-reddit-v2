        "In response to '‚Ä¶you think the CBC has a right wing bias?\nEdit: fuck this ridiculous echo chamber. ALL that is implied by this particular comment is the CBC does NOT have a right wing bias. Person above clearly implied they did. Do you see the words ‚Äúleft‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal‚Äù? That‚Äôs a different argument entirely.', a user said: 'A liberal bias is not a left wing bias. They are centrist with corporate leanings and some right tendencies. Pretty much the Liberals in a nutshell.'",
        "In response to '‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I listen daily and used to listen a lot. If you think they are central they have out done them selves and mission accomplished. Not even close, it‚Äôs very hard to listen to sometimes', a user said: 'If you think they‚Äôre left then the scale really has shifted hard to the right. They are a Liberal supporter for sure but really, they aren‚Äôt left.\nYou‚Äôre literally commenting under an article that is distinctly not left.\nThey run both side fairly often. You‚Äôll see left leaning and right leaning articles and the algorithm we all have feeding us our news will show you what you engage with the most.\nThe talk radio is a different matter entirely though.'",
        "In response to 'https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/\nor\nhttps://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbc-news-media-bias\nEdit: wtf? Ok, I included ‚Äúallsides‚Äù just to have more than 1 (fuck me), but you people actually have a problem with Media Bias/Fact Check?\nhttps://mediabiasfactcheck.com/about/\nIt says ‚ÄúCBC‚Äôs straight news reporting is consistently low-biased, factual, and covers both sides of issues. Editorially, the opinion pages tend to be balanced [‚Ä¶] On the whole, slightly more opinion pieces favor the left.‚Äù\nYou all have a problem with this? Are any of you even reading before downvoting??', a user said: 'Linking a poorly sourced website created by someone who has self-proclaimed biases about a subjective and Canadian specific matter is pretty pointless. Yes in the US it would be considered left. Our Conservative Party would even be fairly left. ü§∑\nCBC is centrist in Canada. They support the Liberals, who are also centrist. That‚Äôs pretty well understood by anyone who understands that there is more than a left vs right dichotomy.'",
        "In response to 'I have a personal friend who is a producer there. He is and has been hardcore left his entire life - working in successive major leftist media publications, and even he was lamenting at how hopelessly, absurdly left the angles and assumptions are they he‚Äôs had to pursue in framing news at his own organization.\nCBC is not remotely centrist anymore.  If you think it is, then neither are you.  It‚Äôs too left for even the lifelong card carrying leftists who work there.  It‚Äôs almost to the point of self-parody.  When my friend explained some of the news angles he had to chase, I honestly thought he was exaggerating for comedic effect.  He wasn‚Äôt.', a user said: 'Yeah the scale clearly really has moved to the right.'"
