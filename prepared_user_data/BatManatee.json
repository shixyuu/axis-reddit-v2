        "In response to 'Well and the lack of NIL In UCLA. Rumor was $1 million  available for the roster, which is about 25-30% of the minimum needed to compete with top 10 teams.', a user said: 'Seconding what JBru is saying.\nWe are never going to be TAMU or Georgia on the NIL front. But Chip was actively opposed to real NIL efforts until this most recent season. He did literally nothing to build passion for the program, or schmooze donors, or anything else that is expected of a head coach. He multiple times refused to come out of his office to even say hi to recruits on their official visits. There are multiple local, 4 star kids that said things like \"UCLA was my dream school, but they never recruited me, so I went somewhere else.\"\nHe sabotaged our NIL and recruiting, then blamed them for his lack of success.'"
