        "In response to 'exactly. ive gone above and beyond and those things become the norm and before you know it youre doing the work of 3 people and still getting paid the same.', a user said: 'Bill Burr has told a great story about this. Bussing tables for minimum wage until a waiter quit. Management asked if he'd wait as well, so he did for an additional $2 an hour or whatever. \"Great! Raise for me, thanks boss\". A line cook quit, so management said hey Bill, could you do that for like $3 extra? or something to that effect. \"Nice, another raise! Thanks boss\" 3 people's jobs for 1 regular pay. Wild. Know your worth, and quiet quitting aka. doing what you're paid for isn't a thing.\nThe story also includes laughing at a co-worker getting burnt, and an alcoholic cook whose scooter was stolen on a cold Chicago night. Highly recommend his Monday Morning Podcast.'",
        "In response to 'I actually left my Sr. Mgt position at an aerospace company and moved into analytics not only is the additional work expected from you you are to impose that philosophy on your employees. There have been instances when i wanted to give an employee a raise and the response ive gotten is \"i looked at their time cards and they only avg 40hrs per week....\"\nmy philosophy is if you cant get your in 8hrs (max) per day u should be more efficient..\nsorry ill gett off my soapbox', a user said: 'You stay on that soapbox sir! I get weird looks from colleagues when I leave at 1800. I’m done, I’ve been bored since 1730, so why on earth should I wait for the boss (who came two hours later than me) to leave, to make it look like I work hard? I do my work in 8 hours, as per my contract. I’m reachable at all hours if something comes up. if I couldn’t maybe there’s something wrong with the way I work.'"
