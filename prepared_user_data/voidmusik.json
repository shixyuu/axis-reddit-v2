        "In response to 'Funny thing is, the union isn't that great. It's like a step up from the bullshit unions you see in grocery stores. They're mainly there to give us free healthcare in exchange union dues. My contractors don't know that though and are more leery of their presence', a user said: 'My bullshit union as a cart boy paid for my lasik surgery for both eyes in full. Honestly, one of the best wage-slave jobs ive ever had, specifically because the Union was so awesome. Never worked another union job, so i cant compare, but my one experience working with a union was overall very positive.'"
