        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'Sort of.  I went to a big city, planning to have a fab city vacation, and a couple of days in, I realized I wasn't enjoying myself.  So I cancelled what reservations I had left and went to a national park a couple of hours away, and found that yes!  I needed nature time and not city time!\nThat's the beauty of solo travel, you can change all your plans on a whim, or skip all the history and culture you planned to see and go shopping, or just go home.'"
