        "In response to 'As someone who is 5 years into the industry, they are a bunch of psychos. I used to keep getting attacked because - \"You only do what you are given. You don't have initiative, you should go above and beyond and voluntarily take up more projects.\"\nBasically, here is the deal - they cannot reduce the salaries. Hence, they are firing people and overworking existing people, expecting them to do additional work. Ie, reduce a team of 10 to 6 and expect the same total team work for the same individual pay. Hence, they are asking us to \"go above and beyond\" and do other people's jobs.\nOh also, meanwhile, they can fire you at anytime with zero justification, and have the security clear out your desk within 10 minutes.', a user said: '\"You only do what you are given. You don't have initiative, you should go above and beyond and voluntarily take up more projects.\"\nHm. How about reversing that to\n\"You only pay what you agreed to. You don't have initiative, you should go above and beyond and voluntarily give more bonuses.\"'"
