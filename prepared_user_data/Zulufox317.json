        "In response to 'If you got that dog in you , you can't turn it off male or female. A lot of peoples pride comes from hard work or they have a athlete mentality. Theres hard work then there's overdoing it though. If you walk 15 miles for 3 days you need 3 days for your legs to recover. Workers are much more productive this way.', a user said: 'I've been walking 12-16 miles about 4 days a week. Just turned 60, dropped 25 lbs last fall. Not the athletic type. Never thought I'd be blas√© about walking this much.\nI'm no expert about Amazon. But I don't expect much at all in re to fairness/equity. I've worked for Pepsi & FedEx. Unless/until you're going to school or upskilling on their dime it'll never be worth it long term.'"
