        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'It's propaganda. It's meant to normalize the notion that performing free labor is a normal and expected part of selling your labor, and that those who refuse to do so may deserve to be dismissed from their positions in favor of those who will.\nWhen dealing with propaganda trying to read it charitably is unhelpful. It's not honestly trying to convey a sincerely held position of the speaker, or the speaker is a useful rube for whomever developed the propaganda, it's an attempt to manipulate you with falsehoods and misrepresentation.'"
