I’m there during contract hours on contract days. I do a good job. Outside of that time frame? No.\nQuiet Quitting, my ass. 🙄 Just another way to blame workers (for doing their job!) instead of bosses.\nI spent years going above and beyond. Got me nowhere.'",

        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting is happening at my school You all have heard it around the world. Quiet quitting or \"simply doing your job and nothing else\" is going around. Anyway the Fall Fling dance rolls around and teachers are \"required\" to chaperone. Basically we are given a google form to sign up for a shift to chaperone the dance. No this isnt paid, yes its on a Friday night after a long work day and week, and no food is not provided to teachers. Total suckfest all around. Well get this, the day before the dance we get a frantic email from Admin. No one signed up to chaperone. NOT A SINGLE teacher signed up to chaperone. We get some messages about how this is mandatory, teachers must be there for the event, we can choose which shift we work but must be there. No one signs up. Cue Admin start walking door to door with a sheet asking people to sign up. Get this, the teachers stand their ground and say no. Of course a few caved, 1 or 2, but overwhelmingly the teachers say no.\n​\nGuess what happened, well they had the dance, the admin chaperoned, the few people that signed up, basically a skeleton crew. The next week nothing, no messages, no angry faculty meeting, nothing. They know that they cant do anything to the teachers because its not one or two, its everyone. Listen I understand that kids need fun stuff to do, but maybe don't make teachers do it, or if they have to be there pay them??', a user said: 'My school is the same! The principal wants us  to do these UIL academic contests and they need teachers to sign up to do the stuff for it. First email, fine.\nNext day, second email, a little more begging. Two hours later, another email: straight up unashamed begging.\nStill only TWO teachers hesitatingly signed up. And that wasn’t enough, so I guess we’re not doing it.\nThen last week was “HEY LET’S DO THE SCIENCE FAIR!”\n::SOUND OF CRICKETS::\nNO ONE IS SIGNING UP FOR ANYTHING. Looks like there will be no dance because no one wants to even organize one.\nOne AP is leaving for good this month, and the other one has his foot out the door. The principal is a young first year principal. She’s fine, but doesn’t really get out of her office. None of my kids know who the principal is.\nI’m on COVID leave (can’t believe I avoided it for so long) and it’s not nearly as bad if you’re vaccinated, but that’s me out for a week. And I might have to take FMLA for my elderly dad.\nFour teachers have had babies just in Aug—October. Five teachers quit in September.\nThe kids ask to go to Mr. or Mrs. ____ room and I’m like WHO? It’s a long term sub. Hell, I didn’t even know who the regular teacher was.'",

        "In response to 'I mean to some extent it used to matter if you went above and beyond. You truly could go from janitor to VP with a high school diploma and the companies would actually try to take care of their employees. Boomers love to wax poetic about those old days but don’t realize that companies are now faceless, soulless giants that don’t give a shit about employees the way they used to.', a user said: 'The American dream is a pyramid scheme. Even back then, that story was a huge outlier and happened only if you were a white man.\nThere are very few at the top and millions at the bottom. It was designed that way.'",
        "In response to 'Like, I’m sorry your entire generation was fooled into thinking that was how work was supposed to be, but it’s not; and this “work/smile harder!” mentality is at the root of a ton of American problems that no one wants to talk about.', a user said: 'Go back to the asshole Puritans. They taught that your entire value as a human was in your work, which is 10000% false. That attitude got imprinted on the American character, unfortunately.'",

        "In response to 'It’s not necessarily the workers’ faults. There is a very real and active movement to vilify real workplace education.

        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'It’s just doing your job. Employers love that particular term because it guilts employees into continuing to give them more free labor. More and more workers are catching on that the American dream is a pyramid scheme. Always has been. More and more are catching on to performance punishment.'",

It’s one of my favorite subs—I’ve learned so much.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I’ve been doing it for about 7 years. It’s lovely. I do my job. I’m a good teacher. I never EVER take work home. I leave my laptop at school. I don’t volunteer for anything.\nAnd guess what? My students’ success is exactly the same!!!\nI won’t ever go back.'"
