        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting, how many people are actually doing this ? I keep hearing this term, just wonder if people are actually doing it.', a user said: 'Are any managers on here?\nMy entire team plus dependent teams have quietly quit.Â  Makes getting anything done a real headache. No one willing to do anything more than the minimum.\nThese are well remunerated staff members with heaps of flexibility.\nPeers initially did soul searching until we realised impossible to change mindsets. Quietly gave up.'"
