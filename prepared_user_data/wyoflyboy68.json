After learning my duties (manually putting jobs together to send out to the oil rigs), I set out automate all the repetitious tasks on my computer.  What took 2 1/2 - 3 hours to build a job packet, I automated and was able to produce the same final output in less than five minutes.  Everyone else in the office started getting all pissy with me because it seemed like I had all sorts of time on my hands. . . I was doing what was asked and expected of me.  I never shared my macro with anyone because someone else would have taken credit for it and would have ruined it for me.'"
