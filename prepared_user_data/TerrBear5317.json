        "I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically",

I’m wondering if you’re getting feedback either that you seem happier/more capable, or that you seem like you’ve check out.', a user said: 'The little things at work that used to bother me honestly don't anymore,  especially since I know I literally don't get paid enough to care. Also it's afforded me the energy I need to further my skill set outside of work(coding)'"
