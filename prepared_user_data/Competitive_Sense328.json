        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. ðŸ’ª', a user said: 'All of the people on here who complain about not getting paid enough to do work:\nI would agree if you had others that put forth minimum effort and you're picking up the slack.\nHowever, I also know of individuals with degrees that get paid less than $15.00 and have the expense of those 4 year degrees in the form of student loans.\nThe skill set involved at HD is minimal.\nHowever, they do expect you to do their marketing, promoting product, hustling and working hard.\nAdditionally, IMHO, the job is not that difficult if everyone would actually do their job, and management wouldn't avoid responsibility to manage the shitty people they chose to fill the job positions.\nThe lazy moron that dropped the pallet on the back of the truck at our store, spends most of his time in the breakroom or shitter playing his Switch, or walks around the store sweating and flipping the phone, actually got a Homer Award the other day. All I said was WTF!\nMeanwhile, they unofficially indirectly retaliate in direct conflict with their non retaliation policy for utilizing the open door policy.'"
