        "In response to 'I said in an interview once that I usually give around 70% which obv. pissed the interviwer off. I was like \"What is the issue? It means that I can do my workload just fine and will be able to give more if needed\".\nShe was like \"Well I'm always giving 100% and on a day like this I'm at 110%\".\nSo i told her \"That is not possible, you look far too healthy for that. At 100% you should be completely exhausted to the point where you can at most fall in bed at evening. 110% would mean you should fall unconcious at any moment now\"\nI didn't get the job, I don't regret it.', a user said: 'One thing that some people don't mention, but absolutely plays into this is the amount of theoretical work one can potentially have.\nLike, I had a job recently where I was expected to do X in Y time. I did some things and was able to get X done in Z time. While I could tell my boss, it becomes a new expectation and either more work is assigned or your hours reduced.'"
