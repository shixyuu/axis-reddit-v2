        "In response to 'It's a PR term to explain away a lack of employee motivation instead of companies admitting that of there's a widespread lack of motivation it's because of bad management', a user said: 'I was talking with a coworker last week about an email that the CEO of the hospital we work out sent out, bragging about how we had a great fiscal year.  I mentioned how it's bullshit that they send those emails and then turn around and give some excuse why they can't pay is more. Meanwhile (I work in gene therapy) we're short staffed because lots of competition pays more. We talked about how they brag about having a great fiscal year, they're constantly building shit, and they clearly are making loads of money. But then they turn around and say they can't pay us more and wave some bullshit \"arms of an angel\", you're saving children type shit in our face so that we feel like staying. Sure enough in our meeting they did all three of those things. They're so disconnected. There's a reason I'm looking elsewhere. Fuck them and their attempts to tug on my heart strings. Pay me.'"
