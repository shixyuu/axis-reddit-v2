        "In response to 'Yeah, I've done kind of a quiet quit.\nI only spend about 30 minutes a week grading now--that's when I don't get the students to grade it themselves.  The good old-fashioned swap papers trick.\nI haven't written a lesson plan since August.  I basically just wing it every day.  Some days we'll go through things in the book; some days I'll just shoot the shit with the kids all day; some days I'll play a movie.\nThere isn't a single one of them who give a shit if they're learning anything or not, so they don't mind.  But my school is short five teachers, and I'm the only one in my department who isn't a long term sub.  So, it's a bit of \"fuck you, fire me.\"\nI don't do shit in the evenings for school; I don't do shit on the weekends for school; I actually eat lunch during my lunch break; and during my planning period I trade stocks on Robinhood.\nI've been doing this 25 years though.  Do I really need to lesson plan?\nI retire at the end of the year.', a user said: 'I am with you on much of this and while I’ve been teaching nearly as long I still have 14 years left.\nI have also quit covering for teachers during my prep. We do get paid, but I use it since I’m not doing anything at home.\nThe kids just don’t care. And while test scores rule, not much gets done when we don’t measure up so why kill myself.'"
