Apply half assedly because I already have a job.\nLazily do phone and zoom interview, with confidence because I donâ€™t need the job to pay my next rent. When they ask why I am looking for another job, itâ€™s simple, money my guy.\nThey say ok, how much are you looking for.\nI give them a number that is within the median wage for the job but on the higher end.\nIf I get a job offer, take it to current employer..\nSay, I want more monies.\nThey typically say, nah fam we broke.\nSo I say, this job will pay more, for the same work.\nWanna match it? If not, this is my two weeks notice.\nHas worked last three increases/ job changes.\nHoping this last move will retire my ladder scheme ðŸ˜‚'"
