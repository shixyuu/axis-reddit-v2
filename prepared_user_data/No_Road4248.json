        "In response to 'Traveling at a sustainable pace is important so I don't think you need to be ashamed of needing a break. If anything you might try to slow down the earlier parts of a trip to reduce that risk of burning out by the end', a user said: 'Yeah I tend to know that if I’m going somewhere for linger than 7 days that for every 7-10 days I need at least one day of them to rest and just lay around the hotel/hostel/bnb watching tv and I plan for them to happen during the middle of the trip so that I’m not feeling burnt out and super tired or homesick my last few days since those are the personally the worst/most guilt inducing days to stay in my hotel. When I plan ahead for them I don’t feel guilty at all because I know it will allow me to enjoy the rest of the trip!'"
