        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'There’s 2 forms of Quiet Quitting\nOne is just ‘work to rule’ and the other is redlining it as close to being fired as you can get away with.'"
