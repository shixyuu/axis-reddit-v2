I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'I recently interviewed somewhere that offered me 60% of what I was asking for and told me \"well based on how you interviewed I can see you getting two promotions in 6 months!\"\nI Lol'd my ass outta that call right quick.'"
