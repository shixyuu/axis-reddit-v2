        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I am manager at a small business tanning salon, and I have a few college and high school staff. I let them know all the time that school and those activities come first (especially to the high schoolers). If a class is a later class and ends after they are scheduled to start I just ask for a morning of heads up and I will stay late for them (not hound them calling and texting or give them crap for it). Makes them feel valued and they don’t take their time dreading coming in expecting to get in trouble by the boss. Same with any last minute appointments. They know if it is slow they can use the computer for school work (better than them playing on their phones). For me though, the people above me suck. My gm cant do her job and do school at the same time so she takes it out of slacking on my location since I’m further way making it so I want to quit and now I’m doing the bare minimum'"
