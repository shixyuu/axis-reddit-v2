Add onto that the forced break in career for maternity leave, etc.\nThere is no 100% answer, it's a large combination of societal factors that impact wages.  Historically men have been expected to do those types of jobs and women haven't either had the opportunity or frankly wouldn't want to do them.', a user said: 'To add to this, men are disagreeable by nature so we re more likely to demand raises/promotions, we re more likely to quit for a better job even if it means moving to another country. Women do this too, but in my experience they re less likely to travel for work and I know women who would refuse a job offer with a substantial pay rise, because her colleagues are 'like her second family'.\nA lot of this I think is due to corporate indoctrination, they re playing on female nature to get you to keep working for their shitty company. I LOVE compassionate women, but ladies, you should be compassionate to yourself first and foremost.'"
