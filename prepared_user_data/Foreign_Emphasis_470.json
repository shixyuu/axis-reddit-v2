They're clocked in but checked out.\nThe worst thing about most jobs is one has to be there.', a user said: 'I once worked in a company in the Middle East where the 8-hour day was the norm. We were so busy that we barely had time to even look at our phone during the whole time. But then, at 4 pm, bye bye.\nAll the meetings, important phone calls, big brain time and whatnot had to happen during this time frame where everyone was available.\nMan this was by far the most efficient company I have ever worked for in all my life.'",
