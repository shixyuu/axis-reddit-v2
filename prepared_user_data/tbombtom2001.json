[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'Imho quiet quiting to me is someone who used yo go above and beyond, did more than asked, took on extra rolls etc, but then stopped because no actual good for them came.\nIf you come in fresh, and do your job exactly as explained and nothing more, that is jist doing your job to me.\nWhen you get to a point where you are doing just enough to not get fired but more than enough to also not get talked too, that's quiet quitting to me.'"
