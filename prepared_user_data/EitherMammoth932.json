My diet consists of doing more work for less pay (adjusted for inflation), out of touch corporate execs that don't understand local culture much less company culture, front line employees that blame those in my position for the lack of leadership they witness on the daily (enforcement of bs company policies), and last but not least ...\n The absolute refusal of the company to increase pay to competitive rates for everyone.  All our departments are short staffed because noone wants to work for these rates and the ones we have here making \"decent pay\" are burnt out with the extra work load.\nThose under my position get screwed, those directly above my position get screwed and who profits? Shareholders.  For now. It will end badly.'"
