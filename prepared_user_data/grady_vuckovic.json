You can't 'pretend to type at the keyboard' at home, no one can see it.\nWhereas if you're back in the office, you always have the 'pretending to type at the keyboard' option. You're there, dressed, at your computer, looking at it, as far as people around you are concerned 'you are working', only need to maintain enough pace of output to keep up that appearance. You can spend an entire day doing nothing and get away with it in an office.\nBecause there's stupidly more trust while you're in the office, and less emphasis on checking your workload to ensure you're working, when you're in the office in comparison to when you're working from home, you can actually work less.\nIf you're working from home, you're usually very aware of the fact your employer doubts if you are working, and work harder to keep up a regular pace of work output so your employer can see you are working.\nSoon as your employer brings you back into the office? Feels almost like a punishment and your motivation to try hard is gone.'"
