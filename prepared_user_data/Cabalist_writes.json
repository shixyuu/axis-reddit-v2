        "In response to 'Original Post: New type of quitting discovered \"Quiet quitting is easy to identify; employees who are quiet quitters visibly reduce their effort and avoid going the extra mile. Soft quitting, on the other hand, happens quietly over time. Employees donâ€™t necessarily reduce their work output, but their enthusiasm fades, their curiosity dwindles, and their emotional connection to their work diminishes.\"\nThe cure is to lick the boot harder.', a user said: 'The fact companies are trying to not say the quiet part out loud and failing and then getting angry about it is telling. They want the firm to be your #1 priority, your focus, anything else is irrelevant. You SHOULD inconvenience yourself for the company. You SHOULD spend your own money for the company. You SHOULD deprioritise your hobbies, your friends, your family.\nIt's then weird that the firm convinces management to enforce this dogma, without much additional reward even for them. You MUST love the company. Its this insidious idea that if employees don't \"emotionally invest\" in the firm then they won't produce good work? And now that is the new bar. Fail to be sufficiently \"loyal\" and now we have a new metric to deny you perks or raises or bonuses.'"
