        "In response to 'With the downturn I’m sick of all these managers telling me to ramp up my activities or take their bullshit marketing leads while they sit on their assess talking about what they did when they\nused to be salesmen\n.\nI work at a FANG and it’s just shocking to see how this downturn is freaking everybody out, and so people are all just pointing fingers anticipating layoffs and how they will plead their cases despite the performance being abysmal across the board.\nI swear to god if I hear “well X is hitting targets” as a deflection against 99% of the org underperforming, I might just leave sales altogether. It’s absurd.', a user said: 'God I hate this we have like 15 SDRS 3 of which are hitting quota\nThe rest are not even close and the only thing they can do is “increase the volume” even though we are already pumping more then the quota hitters'"
