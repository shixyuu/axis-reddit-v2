        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'All that extra effort was perhaps worth it when a family of 4 could prosper on a single salary… when you could work your way through college… when you could buy a reasonably priced house… when your employer provided a pension.\nYou don’t get to take all that shit away and still get peak employee performance.'"
