I know that they should be paid more and would be easily snapped up by a competitor. I'm uneasy that they'll eventually find out and move on - even though the warning signs have been there for ages and yet I chose to do nothing about it until it is inevitably too late and my feeble attempt to guilt (ie \"I'm disappointed that you're demonstrating a lack of loyalty\") only resulted in that individual laughing in my face and telling me to go fuck myself.\"'"
