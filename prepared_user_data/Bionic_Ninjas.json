        "In response to 'Depends on the industry.\nMany positions have metrics.  Quiet Quitting would be always doing the targeted goal, never exceeding. Never volunteering.  Always a \"meet\" never a \"exceed\".\nAs an owner and manager of people, these \"meets\" are valuable for 4-8 years.  Every 4 years you change the titles of the workers from \"Line worker\" to \"Inspection Engineer I\".  Then you can \"eliminate\" the need for positions of the older \"Line Worker\" when you restructure and hire a batch of cheaper \"engineers\".\nPeople's knowledge and contribution become stale after 8 years if they are not working on individual development. Those who \"exceed\" you can shift to a new team and retitle them so they are safe.', a user said: 'Ahhh late stage capitalism, where doing the job you're paid for makes you a lazy, expendable resource.'"
