        "In response to 'Original Post: OMFG. What?!? So regular working is \"quiet quitting\" now? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0xvxv41m8axc1.png', a user said: 'This is me tbh. Last job sucked so bad that i had to openly criticise management to initiate change. Privately it failed. Publicly it failed. So i continued working, doing a better job than most colleagues and making the management uneasy just by silently judging their incompetence. Also reported them via some sort of kuba app they use for HR. They had nothing to complain about so when we got into an argument they said \"nobody is forcing you to work here.\"\nNext day i gave my one month notice with a smirk on my face. Same day they told me i don't have to come to work at all for the last month and i'll still get paid. Month later, manager was fired. Fuck em.'"
