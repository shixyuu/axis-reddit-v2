        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'I worked for a specialized, custom manufacturer. I won’t say for what bc it may give it away. Anyway, the boss/owner was a pretty good guy. He’d pay double time if anyone had to work over 40 hrs when we had a boatload of orders and he believed in prophet sharing yearly. Even still, I never wanted to work that OT. My free time was way more important to me than double time. (I was lucky enough to not need the money.) The pressure though to stay and work that OT was intense. In my opinion, you shouldn’t have promised those orders. Be truthful to your customers about delivery dates. Don’t stress out your employees and guilt them into working more. That was just me though. Everyone else was happy for the money.'"
