        "In response to 'Yeah that was embarrassing. What a waste of OP’s time, energy and expertise. That’s someone who strikes me as the kind who “just wants it to work” and doesn’t want to give any input or effort.\nImo he should be the one writing “TIFU by avoiding communicating with my colleague for 3 months and caused them to rage quit. Now our project is behind and it’s my fault”.', a user said: 'That's the most confusing thing though... He didn't read any of the last 3 months of reports, proposals, etc.  But\nnow\nhe had something to chime in about?\nNow\nhe had his concerns?  If he was going to remain willfully ignorant all this time, he maybe should have just kept his mouth shut and let the damn approval go through?\nI'm angry for op's sake at this point.'"
