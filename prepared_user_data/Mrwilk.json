        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'Really not much info to go off of in the linked article, but a point I find interesting to ponder is what exactly quiet quitting means for the Japanese workers they're talking about?  It's not nearly as unacceptable to leave work before your boss at firms in the US, nor are you expected to stay out with coworkers eating and drinking well into your weeknights most days.  Are those the kind of work expectations that the younger Japanese are increasingly shedding, or is it something more meaningful to productivity akin to US workers not completing work outside of their job description?\nEither way, good for them and I hope it continues.  While Japan has a lot of positives as a country, very few are related to their work-culture IMO, and this would be a net benefit for the Japanese worker.'"
