If someone is \"quiet quitting\" or unable to keep up then get rid of them quickly before their incompetence / apathy becomes a problem for you and the rest of your team.\nThis isn't a team sport.  If someone sucks to the point it impacts you or brings unnecessary scrutiny/attention on to you then you shouldn't feel bad dropping a tip to management to get rid of them.', a user said: 'I don't see how that helps you at all. Lol on the contrary, you have effectively raised the bar just by getting rid of the low performer and put a brighter light on yourself. That people of your persuasion don't see that is quite laughable. Unless you are HR, then this post makes *perfect* sense.'"
