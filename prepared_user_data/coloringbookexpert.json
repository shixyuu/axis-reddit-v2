        "In response to '“What does your contract say?\nOhhh you don’t have one.\nSee, “quiet quitting” is just a new phrase for “work to rule” which means strictly abiding by your contract. What you are doing by refusing to do school work isn’t “quiet quitting” to hold an\nemployer\nup to a standard that benefits you and other employees, its just shorting yourself on the free education you’re being handed on a silver platter.\nSee, you aren’t here doing work for me. I’m not your work supervisor. You aren’t producing a good or a service that is of benefit to anyone, for which you should receive payment or recompense.\nYou are here as a\nconsumer\n, and you choosing not to partake is about as smart as getting a gift certificate for free Starbucks, throwing it in the barista’s face, and saying that you are “quiet quitting” because they can’t make you take a free drink.”', a user said: 'this is IT right here. i use that metaphor so often. like how are y’all gonna scrape your plate of food into the trash in front of me and then ask me for seconds.'"
