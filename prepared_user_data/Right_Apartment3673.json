        "In response to 'Original Post: What I learned from quiet quitting for 2 years across different companies. Note - always evaluate your risk profile, goals and skills before quiet quitting.\nNote 2 - Quiet quitting means you deliver on the minimum expectations of the job without going above and beyond.\nI‚Äôve (25yo) got about 4 yoe. 2 of which I have quiet quitted. This is what my experience was -\nSince I had taken a step back and delivered just the bare minimum, I was basically working 2-3 productive hours a day and additionally attending any meetings.\nI realised I can bullshit and cruise at work for a very very long time before it caught up to me. Companies actually seem to have a very high tolerance to bullshitters.\nAn alternative name for bullshitting is ‚Äúcreating visibility‚Äù. So many a times, I basically created a lot of visibility about things that dont matter, and cruised for months pretending about solving them. This was over and above the bare minimum requirements though\nOr I gave 10X the quote for the time required to do something. Now, I would caveat it by saying, I am pretty good at my job. Better than the people who ask for timelines. So all I needed to do was package stuff in a manner for the timelines to be plausible, or add fluff work to pad the timelines.\nWhat I understood is that almost everyone is in this bullshitting game at work. Some do it to further their career, others do it to slack off at work. And those who do honest work end up getting burdened with a crazy amount of work.\nGiven the layoffs and companies showing their true colours wrt how loyal employees are treated, it doesn‚Äôt really make any sense to be that honest guy doing everyone else‚Äôs work.\nBottom line is there wasn‚Äôt much difference between how my career progressed when I was working my ass off vs while I had quiet quit. It‚Äôs just that, to get a promotion, I am having to switch companies.\nTook me 4 years to go from software dev to senior software dev. I don‚Äôt really mind that since my income has always been decent even as a software dev. The pay per hour of work though‚Ä¶ absolutely insane when you‚Äôre working 8-10 hours a week üòÇ\nIf anyone‚Äôs experiencing burnout, and toying with the idea of quiet quitting, I feel there‚Äôs a few checkboxes to tick before you take the step.\nEmergency fund of 1 year. This is a must.\nYou should be very good at your job\nYou should be comfortable switching companies as often as every 1-2 years.\nKnow that your career will have a shorter shelf life. So maintain a very high savings rate.\nYou shouldn‚Äôt have any dependents.\nI believe there‚Äôs a lot more to life than working over the bare minimum requirements of a job. I get paid for the minimum requirements, and not for the additional stuff. So why do the charity. Companies aint going above and beyond for me when I ask for a pay hike in accordance to work delivered that was well over expectations.\nI was doing it both while in WFO and WFH. Go to office, eat, chill and play video games, lol. I feel I work a lot more hours when WFH.\nAgain, quiet quitting doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt do anything. The bare minimum is a must. If I have to build a whole service myself as a bare minimum, then I will do it and have been the owner of sizeable services in my exp. it‚Äôs just that if it takes an average person 6 months, and I could do it in 2 months, then I would quote 6 months with a scoped down version, and another 3 months to flush it out with all the bells and whistles', a user said: 'First things first, an excellent post. However, You're confused between a free rider and quiet quitter.\nWhat you've mentioned is called a 'free rider', it has existed forever in personal and professional lives. It isnt quiet quitting. Free rider is all that you've mentioned, with the intention to lie and get by and delay team and work and consequently promotions and hikes or awards. It stems from need of comfort zone and wanting free money till it pays and till he's caught.\nQuiet quitting is different that is a response to laying off when you've been loyal and delivered successful projects. Its a response to no hikes, promotions, bonuses and rewards and false promises of it being in the next cycle. Quietly quit the work that a person innately wants to do, excel, feel successful and get rewarded, because they are punished for it by lay offs and zero value to loyalty.\nYou have messed it up or tried to use punishing corporate environment to justify your free riding ways.\nEither ways, what you've mentioned works - be it in free rider or quiet quitter. Actions are thw same but intent and people behind it are as similar as chalk and cheese. The free rider is an active work shirk-er while quiet quitter is a competent self driven worker who is forced to cut back and choose stagnancy owing yo depressed and punishing environment for his work competence.\nBut the difference lies in the person who falls in the two buckets. Free rider will ever try to actively evade work and any responsibility and fret accountability, timeliness or collaboration where his lying will be caught, anywhere.\nA quiet quitter will eventually get fed up of stagnancy and quit to make something of his own or team up with fellow motivated people to find their life back.\nLastly, full support to your choice. When companies use and fire away, the employees should do so too üëç'"
