        "In response to 'Original Post: Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing.

We totally did quiet quitting - we just called it \"slacking\". And this shit started way before us, I'm sure there were slaves building the pyramid who were like, \"You know what? I'll help move this giant fucking block, but those POS overseers can dust that shit off themselves.\"\nAnd they were right to do so!'"
