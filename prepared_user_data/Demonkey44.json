At this point workers are just being selective.\nEmployers still think it’s 2008.\nQuiet quitting isn’t a thing. You couldn’t get your work done if you were doing it. Looking for hybrid options with better insurance, more  PTO, a shorter workweek and less of an insurance deductible/share is called being selective.\nI read somewhere that a synonym for “quiet quitting is “inflation adjusted ambition” they’re not wrong.'"
