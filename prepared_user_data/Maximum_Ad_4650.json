        "In response to 'Oh thats per year and\njust\nfor courses not living expenses (which were roughly equal to my tuition prices)  so you're looking at 20k a year x 4 years, 80k.  Then, unless you were poor, interested has been accruing the entire 4 years.\nThen, because a lot of us graduated during the 2008 financial crisis + 2020, a lot of people had to take deals to pay less then the minimum payment and thats caused interest to balloon.', a user said: 'Exactly what happened to me. Good thing every adult told me that education debt was \"good debt\" and that it wouldn't keep you from getting a house, etc. Such a load of bullshit through and through.'",
        "In response to 'I'm from the UK so I'm not sure how it works in the US but how does someone get $100k in debt from student loans? Quick google showed the average course for a state college is $10k for a US resident and a private college was about $35k, and thats for the fully course not per year.\nI'm asking because in the UK out student works like this, when you apply for a higher education course so college or uni you're allowed up to 4 years of tuition from the government, It basically gives you a cap so you can never get into that sheer amount of debt. And once you start earning I think its Â£25k a year you then have X amount taken out of your pay basically like an extra tax.', a user said: 'Your quick googling is wrong. That is 100% the per year price and that is just tuition, nevermind books or living expenses.'",
