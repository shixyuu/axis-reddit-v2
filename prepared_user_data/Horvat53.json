I would do overtime if I knew the project was important, but it would rarely be that much. As I got into a senior position with more responsibility, I wanted to move into a manager position and was told I was rejected purely because I don’t work overtime. I was told I can get with the culture and do OT or leave. I found a significantly better job a couple months later and left and my VP immediately regretted losing me and the wealth of knowledge/experience I had. My departure immediately negatively impacted the team for months.'"
