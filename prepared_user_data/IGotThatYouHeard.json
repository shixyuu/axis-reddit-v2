        "In response to 'Has anyone here ever worked somewhere, had a supervisor quit, then had to do the supervisor's job, but while being told they can't actually make you officially the supervisor yet, just so they don't have to give you a pay rise? I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'That’s actually the reason I left my last job.  My manager was incompetent and I often found myself doing his job for him while he raked in the bucks.  He got fired and I was like “hey I already know how to do his job basically, why don’t we train me to do the stuff idk how to do and bump me up” they said they would give me a trial run.  I aced the trial run and they came with some\nBullshit about how it’s too soon for me to be a manager because I just started there a few months prior.  So I left.'"
