        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting got me a bonus and a 15% raise I work from home and stopped trying about a year ago. I do monthly closing entries (10 hours of work), but other than that, I hardly do anything. I take my time responding to emails, decline meetings I don't have to join, etc. Since we were acquired and there's been turnover in management, my boss doesn't know what my job involves, and is also weirdly-averse to delegation (workaholic type), so I don't get assigned to anything.  Since I'm just chilling all day with my dog, I'm holding out here until they replace me or until kids come along, maybe in another year.\nWell my boss called me up today to tell me I'm doing a \"great job\". We exceeded targets, so I'm getting 2x my bonus (20k, target was 10k), and a 15% raise (100k to 115k).  Que sera, sera..', a user said: 'This can happen.  For a long time,  I wondered why companies only give 1%-5% raises, when anyone they are giving raises to, could jump to another job and probably get a 15%-20% raise.\nLike, why would they do that?  Isn't it less expensive to pay your existing employees more and inspire loyalty, than it is to hire new people and train them?\nWell, I have the answer to that above question.\nThe answer is that 90% of the professionals do not job hop, and never will.  They stay at the same company for 10 years, 20 years, etc.  The \"Loyalty\" a company tries to inspire is code for \"We get to pay you less, drone\".\nI recommend to anyone starting a professional career in most things that they want to job hop about every 3 years.'"
