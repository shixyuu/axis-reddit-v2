        "In response to 'There’s no such thing as PhD material, that’s such an elitist way to blow off legitimate struggles students experience due to barriers that are known to exist in higher ed for nearly everyone.', a user said: 'But there is such a thing as PhD material, it just comes in different forms and OP does not appear to have any of them. If they are supposedly overachieving and still failing, they should discuss with their PI next steps to either prevent burn out or understand next steps with an existing failed project.\nOr they make the decision to leave on their own without acting like a child and “quiet quitting”.\nPhD holders come in all shapes and sizes but not sure OP is one of them and that’s okay.'"
