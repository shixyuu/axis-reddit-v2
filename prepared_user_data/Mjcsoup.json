        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'You are not alone - and I love all the comments in this thread confirming we aren’t alone! My company raised our quotas this fiscal to thirsty levels while our OTES barely budged. Our sales force and top reps are peace-ing out.\nI don’t really like the term quiet quitting but I have been doing closer to the minimum activity required. I’m pregnant and due in Feb 2023, once I leave for maternity I’m likely not coming back. I just don’t care right now, the hunger is gone and I’m burnt. I’ll consider looking for a new job next summer or fall possibly out of sales completely in exchange for less stress. It’s not worth the looming doom every Sunday night. Best of luck on your search OP'"
