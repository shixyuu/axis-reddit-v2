It shouldn't be looked down upon to just want to come in, do your job, no more, and go home. \nI am currently doing this, myself. In fact I have asked to be taken off of some extra duties that I have been given over the last year.\nHOWEVER...\nIf you actually want to progress within your job and make it a career, don't be surprised if you do \"quiet quit\" and you get overlooked for promotion.\nTaking initiative, helping other people/departments, going above and beyond are all things your employer will tend to look for, just to make their shortlist.', a user said: 'This is exactly how our company approaches things.\nEveryone gets an independent rating based on performance v engagement. Doing what's expected will give you a middle score, you'll probably get a basic salary increase.  Doing more  will lead to bigger salary increases and eventually promotions.\nYour ratings is visible to you and you have open conversations about it with your manager at least once a quarter. It's not perfect but the intent and communication is good.'"
