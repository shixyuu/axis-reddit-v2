        "In response to 'I’ve just realised that I’ve been quietly quitting for the last 18 months. Now I’ve really quit!  Cant put up with the BS any more. I was a teacher and now I’m not. Parent BS colleague BS children BS. Outside Agencies BS Senior leaders BS. Especially 10pm texts and being expected to be available 24/7 with pretty average pay. Viva quiet quitting!!!', a user said: 'I'm a teacher and quitting soon. It's insane, my mental health is shot. These kids have stayed at home for 2 years and forgotten all their basic decency, the parents are more entitled than ever, etc. It's far too much bullshit to deal with than I get paid for.'"
