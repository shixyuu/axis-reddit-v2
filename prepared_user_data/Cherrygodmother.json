        "In response to 'People are tired of constantly being asked for free work by bosses filled with promises that never happen.\nAn example I used long ago when a manager was wondering why I was only doing what was in my job description...\n\"You keep demanding extra fries for free and are surprised I'm not bringing them to the table for you?\"\nIt's really not hard to pay for your damn fries.', a user said: 'When I stood up to one of my bosses by saying I wasn’t going to (more specifically I didn’t have the time or manpower to) cover another employee’s projects and fix their mistakes because it wasn’t within my job description, he literally said “drink some coffee, take a Prozac and work overtime.”\nManagers/directors get promoted to these positions just to sit back and be lazy and selfish. They sit in meetings all day shooting the shit and take credit for their employees’ work and it is INFURIATING. No wonder people are “quiet quitting” en masse. We can only take it for so long'"
