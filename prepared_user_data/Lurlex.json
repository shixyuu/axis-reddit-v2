        "In response to 'Paying X and getting X10 does not apply anywhere else in the market\nThis is what I don't understand about employers who expect their employees to \"go above and beyond\" like, if someone hired a contractor to lay some turf no one would expect them to also replace a broken fence, so why do they expect it from a regular employee?', a user said: 'I believe that the reason this manipulation works so well is because the Puritan work ethic is still such an obsession for Americans. I definitely struggle to this day to try to untangle the brain programming that equates \"hard work\" with virtue, and asserts that not wanting to do hard work is evil. That shit runs DEEP throughout most of our childhoods, especially in the public education system.\nThat the actual truth is far more nuanced than that is not something anyone bothers to talk about.\nCorporations have an easy time manipulating us because of that childish understanding that we still have of what \"work\" should be. The Corporation only has to tell you that if you refuse to work for peanuts, it's not because it's not enough money. It's because you're LAZY.\nThat's about all it boils down to.'"
