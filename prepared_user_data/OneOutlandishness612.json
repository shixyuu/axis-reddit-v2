        "In response to 'We have a mixed bag of that where I am at. The previous company I was at couldn't get anyone in for interviews. They raised the wages, changed the titles to something more enticing, nothing worked. The new place I am at now has 10+ applications with each position opened. A lot of it depends on the type of company and size too.', a user said: 'Exactly what I'm going thru and it's mentally overwhelming. They're pushing for changes, which I do agree with but in uncontrollable way. I get hit from all sides plus the users. And nothing is documented but all these team (server, network) are asking me for documentation.\nAnd on top of that, as400 and applications teams are non existant.
