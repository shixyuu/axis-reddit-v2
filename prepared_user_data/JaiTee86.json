        "In response to 'It's not \"just doing your job.\" Its doing your job\nexactly\nas the handbook says:\nIf the handbook says you shouldn't lift anything heavier than 50 pounds without assistance, then you weigh everything to make sure it's not over 50 pounds. And if it is, you leave it - that stuff can wait until someone else has free time to help. Unfortunately, everyone's too busy weighing things, so that might be a while\nIf your job description doesn't include answering the phone, you don't pick it up no matter how much it rings.\nIf the handbook says employees should get up and stretch their legs every couple hours, you and all your coworkers take a little walk at the exact same time since you're all on the same schedule.\nIt's essentially malicious compliance', a user said: 'My old workplace told us that we couldn't lift anything over 50cm alone as it counts as a bulky item, we basically ignored that and just used common sense to see what we needed a hand with, one of my coworkers got written up for it after the boss measured a box he was carrying and it was like 60cm. One of the main things we sold there was fishing rods and with a very small handful of exceptions every fishing rod ever made is over 50cm so anytime we had to move a single rod, we'd page someone to come help, eventually the boss put in writing that fishing rods aren't counted as a bulky item, so I started measuring every box and then using Pythagoras theorem to work out the distance between the two furthest apart corners to ensure it was under 50cm until they put in writing that we as individuals can determine if a box is bulky or not.'"
