Cause if your employer is already getting the job of two people from you for min wage, they have no incentive to hire anyone else. And it is possible to make yourself too valuable to promote. It might be more profitable for them to keep you in a lower position that you’re already overworking yourself in than promote you and have to find someone who won’t be as profitable in that same position.', a user said: 'My dad was a tubing bender for off-shore panels that basically run everything. After 20+ years at his craft he was super fast and his BPD made him pour himself into his work hard. When he got hurt from a car accident and couldn’t work anymore, his boss came to the house to bring his toolbox and said if he ever gets better he can gladly have his job back because he had to hire 2 people to do what my dad did and they still weren’t as good or efficient at the job. Not to mention it’s one of the most important parts of an oil rig’s operation.'"
