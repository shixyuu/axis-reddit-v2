        "In response to 'Original Post: Reddit was so hot on \"quiet quitting\" but now when you talk about using slowdowns to interfere with the fascist takeover, all you hear is crickets We are at a pivotal moment, where either we choose to plunge the system into darkness on our terms temporarily, or the oligarchs drive the system into darkness on their terms for the foreseeable future.  And yet, so many people seem willing to just continue, business as usual, even as our protections (worker protections, immigrant protections, social services) evaporate before our eyes.\nThe ruling class may own the companies, but the working class still runs them, and we have a chance to use that to help ward off the darkness.', a user said: 'Very few have the courage to go on record in the face of human rights abuses and lawlessness.\nUntil the architects of this quiet coup are dead it is all chaos. Americans are going to have to learn gu√©rilla warfare from the grass up. They have trouble organizing and getting time off for marches. Price gouging and illegal terminations are rife. The court dockets are filling with lawsuits. Chaos reigns. Give them a minute.'"
