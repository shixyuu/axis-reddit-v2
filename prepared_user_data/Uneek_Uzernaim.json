        "In response to 'Original Post: I have Stage 4 Cancer and my wife quietly quit our marriage. AMA What the title says and add in the current climate in the US, so to move out and get a divorce would leave us both fucked.\nEdit: Wanted to tell everyone thank you for your kindness', a user said: 'Damn. I'm sorry, and it's not right she did that. Has she left the house? Is she with someone else? Did she bother to explain herself, or did she just ghost you?'",
        "In response to 'We still live in same house. She refuses to leave even for a bit as we are close to her family. I would have to quit my job and move if I had to live for sometime with a relative. Obviously with cancer I can’t quit as I need the insurance, so I am trapped or fucked so no real winning situation.', a user said: 'Again, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Keep taking care of yourself and your kids. Whatever you do, don't leave the house. I agree with others saying to take measures to legally protect yourself and your assets for your kids.\nAs much as you may want to believe your wife will act in the best interest of the kids, she is acting out of fear in ways that insulate herself from you, so she is already putting her own avoidance of being present amid your suffering ahead of everyone else. In the fear response of fight, flight, or fawn, she has chosen emotional and physical flight thus far. Don't assume she won't go further if she continues on this trajectory and eventually talks herself into leaving.'",
        "In response to 'Maybe something I need soon. Trying to do this as civil as possible as we have kids and I don’t want things to be nasty for them.', a user said: 'Don't kick yourself to the curb just to make it easier on her. You deserve better than that.'",
        "In response to 'Sorry, not buying it.  No one doesn't know why their marriage failed.', a user said: 'People have been known to leave marriages before because they couldn't handle dealing with a spouse's devastating diagnosis. It adds emotional insult when support is needed most from loved ones on top of the injury of a possibly terminal disease, but it's unfortunately more common than you may think. It's cowardly and selfish, but it sometimes truly is a nasty development that the ailing spouse never saw coming. Often, the reasons given are after-the-fact self-rationalizations that make them feel better about their abandonment of their spouse rather than owning up to the fact that they are just scared and couldn't handle being a caregiver to a very sick partner.'"
