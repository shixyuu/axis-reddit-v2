What has changed is that as the previous poster said, the market has shifted to favor employees, you now have significantly more people coasting at their jobs, so HR decided to start calling it quiet quitting to make it sound like it's bad.\nDon't let companies take advantage of you and only do the work you're paid for.', a user said: 'lolllllll “HR is calling it quiet quitting”. You have no idea how many times i have had to explain to managers that they can’t put someone on a performance improvement plan because they are meeting the expectations and not going above and beyond.\nManagement calls it quiet quitting cause they don’t know shit about people. HR calls it “equity theory”.'",
