        "In response to 'My big issue is that I've looked at other places in my field and all the positions pay roughly what I make now, which does not give me any reason to leave. Might be time for a career change I guess.', a user said: 'I'm seeing the same thing in my field. I'm absolutely miserable in my current job but when I look at job postings I would either earn the same amount or take a pay cut to jump ship.\nAbout this time last year I was seeing the same jobs being offered with salaries 10-15% higher than mine. This was during the \"Great Resignation\" scare that had companies desperate to hire and retain employees. But it only last a few months and then the narrative switched to \"A recession is coming!\" My current company reacted to this by freezing hiring, holding two layoffs and not giving raises. Ever since then they've been posting record profits. And where is this recession? I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but could it be that the recession scare is being overplayed to give power back to the corporations?\nUnemployment is historically low in the USA, corporate profits are at record highs, and yet wages are historically low when adjusted for inflation. So the corporate gaslighting is working very well.'"
