I particularly enjoyed the insight from \"[workplace] decorum expert\" (\n1\n) Pattie Ehsaei\n\"Quiet quitting is doing the bare minimum required of you at work and being content with mediocrity,\" she told the BBC.... \"Advancement and pay increases will go to those whose level of effort warrants advancement, and doing the bare minimum certainly does not.\"\nThe simple fact that the quoted segment follows Emma's story of having her workload increased to the point that she was \"\ntaking care of the whole team\n\" and that she was turned down for a pay rise shows just how little Pattie seems to know the workplace.\n1.\nnote that while I\nam\nquoting, I'm taking the liberty of quoting and using scare-quotes at the same time because, really? A \"\nworkplace decorum expert\n\"? I can't tell if this a symptom of peak capitalism, or some form of prank that just went on too long for her to take it back.', a user said: 'scare-quotes\nNever heard someone use this term before.

Quite often scare quotes are used to express irony or sarcasm (\nhttps://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/quotes/scare\n).\nIn this specific instance the quotes indicate my disbelief in the role of, or the likelihood of there being such a thing as, “workplace decorum expert.”', a user said: 'Nice, thanks!'"
