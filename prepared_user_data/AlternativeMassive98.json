        "In response to 'Gen X’er here.  I’m truly sorry my generation sucks.  I used to be in the camp of “work your butt off; be a slave to your job”.  Then, I got laid off twice in Corporate America.  The second time I was laid off (not the same company as the first), I realized how I could be dedicated to my job but have no one care.  I was a single mom, and one of my kids is disabled.  I remember crying in the conference room when they told me, and all management wanted to do was send me off into the next conference room with the company that was going to help me find a new job.  The same people that I worked late for and gave up time with my kids for in order to meet client deadlines did not care one bit about the hardships I was facing by losing my job.\nTeaching is my 2nd career, and I jumped in all eager to work my butt off because surely parents and students appreciate all of the extra time I was putting in!  Hahahahahahaha!!!!!!\nI work my contracted hours now.  I do not get everything accomplished that I need to, but the world somehow keeps on spinning.  I wish I had figured this out 20-some years ago.\nThankfully, my admin acknowledges that we have too much to do and not enough time to do it.', a user said: 'Same! Gen Ex, second career, have been taken advantage of since I started and I’m not doing it anymore'"
