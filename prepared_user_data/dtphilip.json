        "In response to 'Original Post: [The Philippine Star] \"Quiet quitting\" is taking over the workplace â€“ what exactly does it mean? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'Ang minsan mahirap is yung pag pabibo ka sa work, sayo ibibigay mga extra load pero walang extra pay.\nI'm in that age where I just report for work and just do whatever the contract expects me to do. Whenever may pa-extra, if na-assign ako then light load naman, eh di g. Pero wala nako sa bibo phase, matagal na. HAHA.\nI clock out from work on time, I never have to think about my co workers doing OT , coz apparently our work is different naman from each other, and if marami pa sila gagawin it's not my fault naman na. I always grab the chance to go home early if meron chance.\nKaya sometimes I feel irritated when a co worker of mine is dinadamay ako sa tasks coz masyado siya pabibo. I experienced din na yung boss from dating work ko since sya and deputy head ng organization, pag may events sya kumakain lahat pero samin naman nya idedelegate. never considering if marami kami ginagawa'",
        "In response to 'Totally agree with your point. You are there to work and to get paid that's it. Clock out on time. Don't do unpaid overtime. Don't be pressured by peers saying wala kang pakikisama, we are one family and other BS quotes. Why, if you get sick from work will they pay for you and take care of your family? BE SMART PEOPLE.', a user said: 'For me kasi, at times, unnecessary worry yung magaalala ka if tapos ka pero sila hindi pa. I think it's not your fault naman if you finished early, and for sure it's a wheel phase, sooner or later ikaw naman yung hindi agad matatapos. Imbes na nakapila kana sa UV or nasa byahe kana pauwi, iintayin mo pa yung iba just because di pa sila tapos pero wala naman kinalaman yung work nila sa work mo. Sometimes, a minute could make a difference pag uuwi kana.'"
