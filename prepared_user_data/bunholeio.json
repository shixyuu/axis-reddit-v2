        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. ðŸ’ª', a user said: 'How many people are over 25 doing this?  It's not hard to maintain a pace that completes the job. I did overnights at THD, quit cause I was drinking 2oz of whiskey at lunch and and it got sloppy. But never interfered with my performance and never on the days I ran the equipment.\nWe had a crew of three, thankfully one dude was a beast at the job and would drop 3 cages in an hour.\nThe receiving team had hell with the hundreds of small boxes, but the guys would listen to their music and just grind till 1am.\n I had a lot of fun littering my aisles with boxes and then stomping them flat. Would chuck them over my shoulder as I grabbed the next one.\nDrink more water. The system is designed to churn through the waste and will reward good employees. Get on board with the stock reward offers. your job shouldn't be your only income.'"
