So much traffic  you’re telling me all these people are third shift workers, restaurant workers ? I don’t buy it lol. It just blows my mind how there’s bumper to bumper traffic on a Tuesday at 10:30 am. Maybe these are all work from home people going to the park to do their work lol', a user said: 'There are mid day shifts.  Especially call centers that are open until 7 - 10:00 PM.  Where I work the late shift is 11:00 - 8:00 PM.'"
