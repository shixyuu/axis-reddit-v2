        "In response to 'Work ethic?\nI spent 5 years living in Japan, and from what I saw in the white collar industry a lot of that ‘worth ethic’ is face time.\nWhy were all the workers taking random naps at their desk during the day instead of just getting a good nights sleep? Because it wasn’t socially acceptable to leave the office until their boss had left, and he didn’t leave until 9.  Then they all had an hour commute home. These were not super productive people. They were worn out for no good reason. There is no work life balance.\nYou’d occasionally have someone who dared have a hobby or a work life balance, you could easily point them out because they were well rested and happy. They were also social and workplace outcasts.\nA lot of Japans social issues would be eased by a better work / life balance. For that to happen it would mean a massive top down social change.', a user said: 'There's a great book on all this - why Japan fell off so hard economically and whether it's an issue of Japanese culture.\nThe Contest for Japan's Economic Future: Entrepreneurs Vs Corporate Giants\nBook by Richard Katz\nI read this on the Tokyo subway over the past couple weeks and it's pretty compelling.\nIn short, the innovative companies that rocketed Japan to the top of the world after world war 2 calcified into local monopolies that prevent any new companies from taking the same route they did. They do this with the support of Japan's single party government because the idea of a company of lifetime employed Japanese folding due to competition from a more innovative startup is unthinkable.\nThese old companies do not embrace new technologies because they are too big and have too much momentum to pivot meaningfully. They suck up all the government subsidies that go toward startups in other countries. They suck up all the employees that would otherwise work for startups with the implicit threat of \"once you leave lifetime employment you will never get it again, anywhere\".\nJapan is trapped in an economy where Blockbuster never had to contend with a Netflix because Netflix would not have been able to get any venture capital or convince any employees or seasoned business veterans to face the danger of leaving a lifetime employment company. Except, for like, things a lot more important than movie streaming like the entire digital/computer revolution.\nThis Is not a Japanese culture problem. Japan was very innovative in the past and full of risk takers. The problem is currently the governmentally created carrots and sticks present far more risk than reward.\nThe author also notes to watch out for trends like this in the US where big tech companies have started to buy and squash competition rather than adapt to it and try to saddle employees who leave to form startups to lawsuits and non competes.'"
