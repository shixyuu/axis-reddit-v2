        "In response to 'That’s the whole point of America.\nAmerica in reality is just a breeding ground for people to be groomed to be the perfect workers to be exploited by businesses.\nThis message of worshipping “hard work” and making more $ is rammed down our throat in every facet of life the day we are born. Americans are brainwashed into this cult like mindset that all that matters in life is work.\nCorporations spend billions of dollars pumping this message into the culture, and our education system has also slowly been getting taken over by corporate control as well.\nThis is why the mentality of excessive spending is pushed, this is why Americans are loaded to debt up to their eyeballs. It makes them easily exploitable workers.\nIn America businesses have more rights and freedoms than human beings.', a user said: 'I'm trying very hard to actively remove the pressures of monetary success and spending from my life. It's everywhere, and not just in marketing from companies who want your money. My family spent months making rude comments about my ugly house until I told them if they wanna see it modernized and updated then they should put their money where their mouth is. My house is plenty functional and that's what matters. People treat me differently now that I've let my hair go grey and rarely wear makeup. I always look clean and presentable but I'm not spending money to look glamorous. My car is old, nothing in my life is particularly Instagrammable. But I'm doing what I want to do with my time.'"
