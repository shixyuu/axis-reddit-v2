        "In response to 'Not surprised when it's no longer enough to just do what's on your contract in today's Corporate.  Nowadays your expected to hustle, go above and beyond every day, be constantly taking on more projects / work, live, breathe, shit the company inside & outside the office, be willing to sacrifice your weekends and evenings to answer calls / emails, take on work from employees who have left, be a team player and cover colleagues shift if they are off at short notice, work just as hard as the CEO for 1/100th the pay, all with no extra renumeration.  Oh, and don't you dare think of skipping the mandatory Friday work pub outting (on your time), or your absence will be noted.', a user said: 'Honestly, a lot of floor workers work a lot harder than a lot of CEOs. Now, the CEOs may have far more responsibility should something go wrong but that doesn't necessarily mean they generally work hard at all. In fact, if you've hired the right people to support you in your role as CEO you're probably mostly following their advice.'"
