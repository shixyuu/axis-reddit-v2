        "In response to 'Original Post: And they wonder why we quiet quit.... Worked at a this place for about a year, did a major systems overhaul with them where I was the front runner for work completed for the project, which helped us finish on our deadline, got praised and honored for my work, then I was told I'd get a nice raise, my raise was less than a fucking dollar in software development... I got a 2% raise when inflation is absolutely ravaging the country and prices have gone up much more than 2%.. works a fucking joke...', a user said: 'I worked as a paralegal in a huge case. HUGE. It was going to trial and I was getting everything ready. Notes and exhibits in neat notebooks. Files of said exhibits, etc.. My attorney and I were working until 2am, then the trial started. A 10 day trial where I only went home to shower & change.\nWe win the case. MILLIONS. The $$$$ portion was going to our firm, everyone was celebrating. My attorney told me he reward me. And he did. The final settlement portion going to the firm was almost $10M (in 80â€™s $). My attorney got a bonus of $1.2M from the firm.\nI got a paperweight and $25 gift card. I left the stuff in its box. I wrote out my immediate resignation and left the paperweight & gift card behind. I was so ticked.'"
