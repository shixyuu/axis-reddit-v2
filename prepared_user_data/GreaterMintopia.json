        "In response to 'On whether Harris should run in 2028: please do not rehabilitate her.\nThe campaign itself was ok, but let's be honest, she was a bad candidate. She got asked on the view whether she would have done anything differently than an 81 year old man with 32% approval, and she couldn't think of a single thing! Why not say Gaza, or that the cost of housing would be more of a priority or something\nHer 2019 primary was also a disaster. And in 49/50 states we lost ground. CA governor? Sure, why not. But please not president, she would lose by even more in 2028. Americans want outsiders, not the ultimate insider.', a user said: 'Emotionally, I will always kind of feel like Harris got robbed. Not in the literal sense of course, but in the sense that she ran a better campaign than Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, under worse circumstances, against an older, less coherent version of Trump, and yet performed considerably worse.\nNevertheless, I don't think there's any real interest in\nHarris-Walz 2: Revengence'"
