        "In response to 'The phrase “quiet quitting” needs to go.\nBeing paid to do what you do and not letting yourself get exploited isn’t quiet quitting.\nEdit: I appreciate the awards but rather than wasting your money on fake internet points I’d much rather you donate it to a charity which helps people still caught in the industry trap that I’ve talked about below.\nDonate or go any buy some gear from\nThe Burnt Chef Project\n.', a user said: 'I agree, I don't like the phrase.\nI'm a manager. I wouldn't expect my employees to do dozens of extra hours a week, check their email outside of hours or forgo their holiday entitlement. All I expect is during working hours, they complete the expected amount of work to a high quality.\nHaving worked with Scandinavians, this has always been their ethic - how can I do my job in the shortest time period possible, so I can go home and have quality time with my family. Whereas in London and probably more common with Americans, the culture is more like can I be seen to be logging on at 7am, and still replying at 8pm? Never mind the fact you've had 8 coffee breaks and spent an hour chatting to someone in a different department.'"
