        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Honestly in Germany most people work like this. You work 8h, not including your break time, and than you go home. Sometimes you stay longer because of special projects but for this additional time you will leave earlier when it fits some other day.\nI can only say this for the jobs I had, mainly office. To be honest I would leave a job immediately if extra hours were expected from me.'",
        "In response to 'I really, really appreciate this culture in Germany. And somehow we still manage to be productive. Weird, isn't it? Almost like burning the candle at both ends is a waste of people's lives and reasonable work expectations work out for everyone.\n(it's not true for everyone in Germany, unfortunately, exploitative working conditions are a thing here, too. On average, though, I feel it's better than many other places)', a user said: 'I read recently about a company that switched to a four day week and generated a higher output in four days compared to five, because of better motivated employees'"
