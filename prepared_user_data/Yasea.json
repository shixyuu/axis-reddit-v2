        "In response to 'I spent years of my career as a software tech supervising teams of engineers making literally double my salary. When I finally graduated they somehow couldn't find the budget to pay me within even 10k of the people I was tasking.\nI'm at a different company now and making triple what I was then but honestly I'm doing maybe a quarter of the work, intentionally. Maybe it's quiet quitting or maybe I just got the lesson early in my career that hard work doesn't get you fuck all. I've gone from working 60 hours a week to maybe 10. I'm never going to be that sucker again.\nI was raised by blue collar parents who taught me that hard work was the key to success. Nope. Not even close. It's all bullshit\nHonestly, if I weren't a government subcontractor I'd probably try to dip my toe into the\nr/overemployed\nworld and see how many different positions I could half ass at once', a user said: 'We usually say that the only reward for good work is more work.\nI've seen too many people going above and beyond, only to end in burnout. I've felt the burn myself and hit the brakes. I fully agree with the quiters.'"
