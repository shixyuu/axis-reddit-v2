Even if it’s a few freshly mowed lawns. Some days in Enterprise sales you feel like you had negative or zero impact on your work and it’s not always easy to swallow.'",
        "In response to 'I need this', a user said: 'I hit mid day workouts and take long lunch breaks. Get your work done and enjoy the rest of your freedom! Life is too short, why not just complete all your tasks for the day and then do what you want?'",
        "In response to 'Do just enough email urgent emails but don’t really gotta be on the computer if you do it right', a user said: 'Bruh you could almost do your whole sales job from your phone if you have all the apps connected  (SFDC, Slack, Email, Zoom, etc)'",
        "In response to 'I be doing that. Only thing is if you get a video call and your at target lol', a user said: 'Come to think of it…. People grind and destroy themselves daily for a fraction of what we get. We have it so good man, something tells me the world is changing fast and this won’t last forever…  let’s maximize the shit out of this'",
        "In response to 'Oh no it’s gonna get better. I’m a recruiter and if I have a job where they have to show in person they ghost. Remote people are blowing me up for. Demand is remote and I think the next step is four day work week. I’ll never let a company run me to the ground again', a user said: 'Hey you know what, that’s true. We’ve reached that point where we just won’t take that shit anymore. The world is changing. Fingers crossed - Only up from here.'"
