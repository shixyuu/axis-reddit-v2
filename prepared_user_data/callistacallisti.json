        "In response to 'Ok so government jobs are very tricky for managers. It's easy to say \"This is the so and so solution, and if worker does not comply, they're out!\". This does not happen in government. You yourself acknowledged that it's almost impossible to be fired, and you'd be right. Blatant physical violence, sexual assault, and direct insubordination are the only ways to get fired, and the 3rd one has to be very exact for that to happen. In public, upper management will always say and act like they want accountability, but in reality, they'll look down on you for not being able to handle a problem employee. Right now, your boss way of handling it is giving you the work, and since you haven't brought it up, she'll continue doing so, thinking she's solved the problem. Bring it up and she'll have to find another way to do get that work done.', a user said: 'this space intentionally left blank\nThis post was mass deleted and anonymized with\nRedact'"
