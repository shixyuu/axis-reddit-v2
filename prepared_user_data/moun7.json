        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet Quitting”, not quite quitting, but forcing employers to adapt. [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: 'In my industry (environmental consulting), everything is always so urgent and super duper serious and important. So you bust your ass and get the report to the client who doesn't even read it for a few days/weeks. It wasn't actually super duper urgent, it's just your boss stroking their ego.\nOr, for example, the field work is super duper urgent, but when the field staff (i.e. me lol) calls in sick, and there's no replacement available, then it's okay and the work can be postponed until next week.\nIt's all a farce and working hard just means more work.'"
