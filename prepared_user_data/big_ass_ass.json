        "In response to 'In the company where I work - big boss died a few years ago but when he was alive all the leeches got their places in management because they licked his shoes in every single way. For example, there is a gym inside the property that belongs to the company, big boss had squash lessons there and the coach gave them for free, after a couple months that coach is the gym manager. Meanwhile my manager is a jackass, despises everyone, he is always right and has the mentality of \"if the job is successful it's because of me, if it fails it's my employees that can't do shit\". In the beginning I would work hard and  get constantly spit on, now I do the bare minimum, I'm rarely on my desk and when I'm working I take triple the time to finish the task and the manager says my working method has improved. If they don't see you, they can't remember you. If they don't remember you, they don't have bad things to point out', a user said: 'Great lesson. Thank you for sharing.\nI work in the Art field where every single detail that is made by me (Artist) is supervised and checked carefully in order to not ruin the whole project. If they see that I purposefully slow down whatever job that I was appointed to do, I get disqualified from the project (not really \"fired\" because I'm not employed by them).'"
