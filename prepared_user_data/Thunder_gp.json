        "In response to 'Original Post: Homer Simpson (1995) explaining quiet quitting 27 years before people thought quiet quitting was a new thing. [External Link]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYXzHjbfMDk', a user said: 'If you don’t get paid, rewarded or recognition for doing above and beyond. It is just logic that there is no reason to do more.\nIf they pay you the same for the minimum, then there is literally no incentive.\nIf people constantly said “your doing a great job” it probably would not be a thing. But most people throw insults like “you suck at your job” and it doesn’t help anybody. A positive mindset can do wonders for anybody.'"
