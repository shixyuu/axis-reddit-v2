        "In response to 'Yes it says it's an English translation by English speaking workers of the Chinese phrase invented by a Chinese speaking worker.', a user said: 'Can you pull the quote from the article where it says that? I'm not seeing it for some reason.'",
        "In response to 'So it may shock many that the concept of “quiet quitting” is actually derived from a movement that began sweeping through China last year known as “lying flat” or tang ping.', a user said: 'That does not say \"it's an English translation by English speaking workers of the Chinese phrase invented by a Chinese speaking worker.\" The English translation would be \"lying flat.\" \"Quiet quitting\" is a different term with different connotations. The Chinese did not last year make up the idea up not doing uncompensated work.'"
