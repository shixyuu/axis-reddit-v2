        "In response to 'It is NOT quiet quitting.  It is wrong on the facts: no one is quitting. \n It is wrong on the merits: there is no reasonable expectation that someone does more than what they're paid for.', a user said: 'Bingo.\nAs a manager this is how I look at: If someone stops going \"above and beyond\" their actual duties, maybe we should look at whether this behavior was rewarded financially (or via promotion etc) or not by their employer/manager? You'd have to be a fool to keep going above and beyond if it nets you no benefit and actually is a drain on you personally.\nCompanies and managers cause \"quiet quitting\" not the employees themselves.\nPart of my job is to help those willing to go above and beyond grown into new roles, responsibilities etc. But those who just want to get their job done well/professionally and call it a day are a valuable part of the team as well. They deserve appropriate opportunities for growth as well. Putting the right people in the right place so they can succeed is the job'"
