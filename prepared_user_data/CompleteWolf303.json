Not going above and beyond for your work is not quiet quitting, it’s acting your wage and doing exactly what you’re paid to do.', a user said: 'im pretty sure this has been a thing in japan for a long time as well. its somewhat looked down upon to quit your job, so you just come in and do the bare minimum. the \"work ethic\" people hear about are just hours spent in the office, not hours actually getting things done\njust heard through word of mouth from a few people i know who live there and my friend who used to, so i dont have sources to site and it maybe more anecdotal, so dont quote me on it'"
