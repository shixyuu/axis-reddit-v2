If we went over we had to go to the doctor, get them to sign paperwork saying it's necessary to go over the time, which costs $35 at my doctor's office, and then if you did go over the time they expected you to make it up. They were literally counting the time in the bathroom, and were telling us to limit the amount of fluids we drank and not eat as much fiber. I got threatened with a write up for having to shit too much.'"
