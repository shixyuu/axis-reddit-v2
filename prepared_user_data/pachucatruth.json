        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'Prepared for the downvotes but I really donâ€™t get all of the hate for Robyn..'",
        "In response to 'So what don't you get. I'm interested.', a user said: 'I feel like I missed it. I had watched until around season 11/12 then restarted at the second to last season when Christine had left and Janelle and Meri were working on leaving. I just missed why we all dislike Robyn so much. I went back to catch up and even in season 12 Christine is crediting Robyn for her relationship with Kody getting better.\nShe seems to be genuinely devastated by the events in the family. She said from the beginning that she was marrying Kody because of the situation with the other wives. I feel bad for all of them that this is how itâ€™s turned out.'",
        "In response to 'If you had a best friend or sister in a relationship like Meri has with Kody, would you encourage her to stick around and hang in there for his crumbs? For over a decade?\nMeri says on one of the recent episodes that Robyn hadnâ€™t reached out to her in more than two years. This is how she treats someone she cares about? Knowing that person was all alone for holidays and quarantining according to her rules during the pandemic, she still didnâ€™t let her come over.', a user said: 'I need to catch up on the pandemic stuff. Ty for your insight.'"
