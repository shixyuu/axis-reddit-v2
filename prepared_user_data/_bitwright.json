Seems like every single adult above a certain age knows a guy who was so desperate to work at a particular place that they cleaned it for free for months until they got hired.\nEither:\nThey're all making it up\nThey all knew the same guy\nThere are an unexpectedly large number of people who are a unique combination of dumb and desperate.\nReality check:\nMost places won't let someone handle a broom for them unless they're employed.  Liability issues\nMost places will kick out the person who arrives with a broom to start cleaning\nReally bad PR\nLiability issue\nThe guy who starts doing that risks getting a trespass warning.', a user said: 'There's just a lot of idiots willing to give free labor.\nBack during the recession I got a job doing PC repair. At one point some guy who wanted to learn more about PCs offered to work for free if we would teach him.\nThe boss took him on and once the guy learned the basics the boss fired my ass. On my way out the assistant manager apologized and told me that I got fired because they didn't have to pay the other guy.\nFast forward to something more modern, I saw a post here on reddit about people volunteering to refold clothes and clean up the isles at their neighborhood Target, which was understaffed.'"
