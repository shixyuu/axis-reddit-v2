        "In response to 'On whether Harris should run in 2028: please do not rehabilitate her.\nThe campaign itself was ok, but let's be honest, she was a bad candidate. She got asked on the view whether she would have done anything differently than an 81 year old man with 32% approval, and she couldn't think of a single thing! Why not say Gaza, or that the cost of housing would be more of a priority or something\nHer 2019 primary was also a disaster. And in 49/50 states we lost ground. CA governor? Sure, why not. But please not president, she would lose by even more in 2028. Americans want outsiders, not the ultimate insider.', a user said: 'I think Kamala is great. But she couldn't do anything against the tide turning against democracy worldwide because the pandemic happened. I'm not going to blame her for that. Was she a good candidate in 2020? No, but that doesn't mean she's a bad candidate in 2024 / 28.\nHowever, running her again would be a mistake because it seems to me that we have learned that when the choice is a competent woman or an incompetent man, the voters have a tendency to prefer the incompetent man. I'm not saying that's the only reason she lost, clearly.'"
