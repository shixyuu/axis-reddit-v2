        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'My first job post-military, I had a coworker who would only do exactly what his initial job description entailed. He just wanted to do that job, didn't want to move up or down the corporate ladder. This was fine, when commendable in my eyes. Our managers fucking hated it. I don't know how they got to him, but about a year after I got there, he slowly started picking up their responsibilities. The managers essentially delegated their own tasks to him, with no pay raise or position change. It was such bullshit. These managers were top-tier delegators. One of them did literally nothing for the company, I'm not exaggerating. He did when he was hired, he kind of built the entire division, but then he created a new position to take over his responsibilities. He spent his time in the office, doing work for his OTHER SIDE BUSINESS. Fuck those guys.'"
