Coupled with the closed borders for a long time, the ensuing lack of labor drove the price of those jobs up where it could. Construction workers and kitchen staff saw huge increases in wages. Custodians, not so much (people just decided to put up with dirtier offices, or didn't need as much custodial with people not returning to work).\nBut then we had this hybrid situation thing, and I'll be 100% honest- people working from home are not nearly as productive as people in the office. It's not even close.\nAnd everybody wants to do it. Probably because you don't have to work that hard.', a user said: 'Let's see your sources.

You could easily look at labor contacts and see that information yourself.\nAlso, people working from home are way more productive than in the office. FOH'",
        "In response to 'Entry level positions saw the largest gains.\nPeople locked into union contracts largely did not see gains out of the contract cycle.', a user said: 'Bud.....unions are all over.

I would be with a non union shop RIGHT NOW if there were raises .........'"
