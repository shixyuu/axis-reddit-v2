        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I’m working to contract. I still do one club because I get paid, but I’m not doing anything else for free. I turned down hosting a huge festival we have every fall (that I started) because the district wasn’t sure if they could pay me, so I said that’s fine, I’m not doing it this year, and won’t do it next year unless I get paid. Cue surprised Pikachu face on my new principal- until I explained how much work it is and then she looked grateful that I quit it! 😂'"
