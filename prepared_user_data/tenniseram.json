        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'Are you saying you left early or you got burnt out? Americans like to go go go but a lot of other people like to relax on their vacations, even if they’re to a far off destination. There’s nothing saying you have to do 100 things every day or in every place. If you’re burnt out, rest for a day or a week. Relax.'",
        "In response to 'I so agree with this (and I’m American).', a user said: 'I’m American too. I live abroad and my Dutch  friends always ask are you going on an American vacation or a Dutch one? It’s a very different way of understanding time off.'"
