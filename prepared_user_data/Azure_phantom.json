Which it usually isn't.\nSo they are not even quiet paying; they are giving workers quiet pay cuts. And they've been doing it for over 40 years, which is why people are no longer able to support a home or family on an average job.', a user said: 'Yup. I just broke up with a long term SO. I’m paid well, by most people’s standards, yet rent for a one or two bedroom apartment in my area would run me about half, to more than half, of my monthly pay. Not even the “nice” places, just the average apartments.\nWhen you make $95k a year but can’t afford to move out on your own because of ridiculous rent costs, there’s something seriously wrong with the system.'"
