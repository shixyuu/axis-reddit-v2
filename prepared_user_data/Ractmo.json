Though I am not conservative but I am also not a liberal too. I am just fed up with this concept to worry about the world problem as my problem when I cannot do nothing to resolve it. Its just too much simulation for my mind and makes me depressed quick. In left vs right people forget that majority of the people have mixed views about things, they are conservative in some things and liberal in others.'"
