        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Amazon There's a movement not really just Amazon but work in general since inflation is going so high, people are just giving up trying extra or doing more hard work than what's necessary. Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'I know the difficulty of doing this but there genuinely needs to be a nationwide strike and unionization effort for Amazon warehouse employees, in all honesty. The same applies to pretty much any sector of work similar to that, whether it's pharmacy techs, understaffed hospitals, delivery drivers, retail workers, etc.\nHowever, if the entire USA has the Amazon warehouse workers striking, as difficult as it would be, would definitely send a statement and actually help you guys in the long term IMHO.'"
