        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting big bank I work at a very large bank that is mandating RTO 5 days a week. (Big on the news Iâ€™m sure you can figure it out) I had perfect reviews at year end. I had no issues with attendance when we were 3 days. HR currently has zero track record of me not preforming. Anyone do this and how long did it take to finally get the axe?\nEdit: \nI plan on doing basically nothing and using my month of vacation aggressively over the next 8 weeks', a user said: 'You should definitely do this for science. At another major bank with a lot less strict policies, it took 6-9 months from the day the person stopped showing up in the office to the layoff/do not hire. Incidentally, this person was still able to collect unemployment.'"
