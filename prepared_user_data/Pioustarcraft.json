[External Link]: /r/AskReddit/comments/xwwzxk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_quiet_quitting_acting/', a user said: 'So i started at my current job and said : \"i want to learn the job but i want to grow in the company.\"\nI was there for 3 years when Covid started. I went to work everyday during covid because they needed someone on location.\nI had a lot of extra work but i thought \"i'll show that i'm reliable and motivated\".\nAt the end of the covid periode i starte dlooking arounf and got a few interviews for jobs that paid 20% more than what i have.\nI made an appointment with my manager and HR and explained that i wasn't happy with the situation and surveyed the market and came up with the fact that i wasn't paid enough AND wanted to grow.\nMy manager answered \"you're not the only one that works well\" and the HR said \"compared to the intern scale you're already well paid...\"\nI also applied for a better job intern but was denied because i didn't have enough experience...\nSo i said fuck it... i'll do the bare minimum while looking for something else. I consider it quiet quitting.'"
