One thing that doesn’t get mentioned enough when we talk about work reform is the intentionally vague job descriptions designed to allow enough ambiguity to maximize labor, ie overwork everybody, and in turn allows businesses and talking heads to make us look bad by citing that it’s “literally our job” to meet certain productivity numbers. We should really stress how insane the expectations have become and move to push for legal framework for productivity clauses in employment contracts or even an independent board who can review standards in labor to ensure you’re not intentionally understaffing when you’re making aggressive profits.\nSomething tells me the latter exists but is highly ineffective.'"
