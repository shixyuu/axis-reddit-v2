        "In response to 'Do you think people should learn new things? Educate themselves on current events and new technology? Be curious and inquisitive while searching to grow as intellectuals? Do you believe in life long learning?', a user said: 'Should learn? That's a tricky subject, not everyone values learning for it's own sake and it's not inherently wrong to feel that way.\nIt's one thing to learn more about subjects that interest you or current events, but becoming more skilled at your job is not necessarily better - corporate America has pretty clearly shown that they are not interested in fair compensation for employees going above and beyond the bare minimum. You're putting in extra time, energy and effort for little or no return. Those resources could be better out to use where they can actually benefit you.\nTo put it another way - if one employee does 150% of their job role, above & beyond by any measure...but gets the same annual pay cut as the person doing 90-100% of their job role then any rational person can see that going above 100% is a waste of effort.\nThat realization and the resulting behaviors are what corporate America calls \"quiet quitting\"'"
