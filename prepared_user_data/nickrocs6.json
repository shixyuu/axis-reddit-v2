        "In response to 'Yes. I know one of my friends who got quiet fired by a tech company. Out of the blue she was to attend an “important call” which was about her manager terminating her contract. Within 5 minutes, her accesses were revoked and she was placed on garden leave until her last day of work. No severance package. No questions allowed. It was really bizarre as she was the best performer in her team. Maybe the company just couldn’t afford good performers anymore and wants only mediocre employees.\nApparently this was in compliance with the labour laws in the country where she worked. It was mentioned in the law that “if employees are allowed to resign with notice, the same rule should apply to employers terminating their employees.”', a user said: 'I wish I could remember the correct wording but I saw another post where someone mentioned companies don’t want high performers they want several mediocre performers. High performers will want more money, somehow it’s better to have several mediocre performers and pay them all less. Even though the company will still likely be paying more than just paying the high performers more.'"
