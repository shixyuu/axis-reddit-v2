Not this bullshit.\nNow they are also trying to coin 'Quiet Firing', which is essentially just constructive dismissal or creating a toxic workplace.\nHey Media! Stop trying to create euphemisms for shit that just doesn't need it.', a user said: '\"Quiet firing\" workplace harassment, called \"constructive dismissal\" where I live. It's against the law and you can take the employer to court for severance. Know your rights!\nIf anyone suspects they're employer is \"quiet firing them\", it's time to keep all emails, make records of what happens and when, and be ready to secretly voice record at any time on their phone depending on the laws. Where I live ots a one party consent so if you're part of a conversation, you can record it. You're the one party consenting.'"
