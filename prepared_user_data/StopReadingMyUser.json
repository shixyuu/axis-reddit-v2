        "In response to 'They donâ€™t really care though. Once a company is big enough, like Amazon, they can hire pretty much any moron and the profit still rolls in. It basically runs itself.', a user said: 'This is just what I've heard, not sure if true or not, but also that companies are simply getting rid of their top people to reduce payroll costs. Specifically because they think they can manage without the higher talent.\nWe're at a point where companies look for cost-cutting measures in places where educationally it shouldn't make sense. Go to school, get a degree, get the experience, etc.. All of these things we're told to be successful and have sustainability, and although it wasn't always true, now corporations seem to be undermining the philosophy for those that actually have achieved it.'",
        "In response to 'This is a layoff. They want people to quit and workers falling for it again. They need to show up everyday and Make the company lay you off in a proper way', a user said: 'This is what I did for about a year and a half with one of my jobs. They decided they wanted us to move from a flexible schedule to a rigid one and \"gave people the option\" to decide whether they could make the change or have to leave the company.\nIt conflicted with another part-time job I had at the time so I just never did it and waited to be laid off. Eventually 2 of the managers call me basically trying coerce me to quit since I can't keep with their new schedule and we fought back and forth on it. Eventually I was terminated for \"behavioral issues\" lol.\nUnemployment didn't side with em tho.'"
