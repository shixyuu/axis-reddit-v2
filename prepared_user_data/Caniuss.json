If the grocery store I worked at wanted to get rid of someone, but the person didn't actually do anything wrong, they would just schedule them like 3 hours a week until they got fed up and left.  I see a variation of that now in State Government, where they just shunt the unpopular people off into a subdivision with nothing to do to basically just sit there until they take the hint and leave.'"
