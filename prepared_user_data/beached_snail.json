        "In response to 'My dad spouted that nonsense. To me. His daughter. I think itâ€™s less likely learned in fraternities and more likely at the home.', a user said: 'My Dad was a respecful, loving guy who certainly never mistreated women in the workplace. But I don't think he realized the kind of unequal treatment that was going on in his times, or the types he was aware of he was resentful of. I remember him telling me about women that used sex to get promotions. As an adult now in the workplace I feel really bad for those women in the 1970s who may have thought those were the only choices they had, or may have felt that that was the best choice. How many women were really getting promoted on merit in many male-dominated industries back then? Sure some yeah, I don't mean I'm saying those women made the right choice. I'm just saying I have sympathy for them. Anyways, I don't think my father really realized all the subtle forms of inequality, especially those that were still present, until I started working in a male-dominated corporate world and telling him my stories week after week. I think about that with the men that I've worked with, even the ones that have daughters. And I think, my own Dad who loves me and definitely thinks women are as smart as men, didn't see all this stuff for what it is until I told him about it over and over again. So any man who isn't hearing this from his daughters, or if his daughters do something else (like they are teachers or nurses so they don't have corporate problems) I just think they will continue to be ignorant and think sexism has been \"solved\" a long time ago.'"
