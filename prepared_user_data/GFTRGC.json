        "In response to 'Original Post: How to Approach Annual Review After I Quiet Quit Almost a year ago, my boss pulled some power move BS and I made two changes as a result: I took work email off my phone and stopped working more than the expected hours. No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a \"good idea fairy\" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't.\nMy boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise.\nSo now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the \"extra\" stuff has fallen away.\nIt will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?\nFWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years. Thanks!!', a user said: '\"We've hit all our strategic goals for this past year\"\nThat's how I would spin it. Then, if she talks about the drop in extras, talk about how your priorities were focused on the strategic goals and that you prioritized those over the less essential tasks.\nIf she says they're important too, then feign ignorance in saying that you didn't realize she wanted them as they were part of the strategic goals the team had set at the beginning of the year, and that you didn't know she wanted you to focus on them.\nEssentially, you never let the blame move to you. She is your boss. If she wanted those things to be prioritized, she should have vocalized it sooner than your annual review.\nAlso, I'll caution that if you're hoping she retires and you're expecting any chance of slipping into her role, quiet quitting might be a mistake. I'm not advocating for doing unpaid work, or going above and beyond what you're paid for. But, if you're just doing the bare minimum, it's unlikely they try to promote you.'"
