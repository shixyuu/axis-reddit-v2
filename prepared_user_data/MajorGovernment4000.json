        "In response to 'In what occupation can you say “mmm nah not gonna do my job because I don’t think it’s worth it!” Yet get paid $100k+, get amazing benefits and get to retire earlier than a majority of the population other than being a police officer!?!?', a user said: 'Yea, this is so absurd to me. Like at my job, I can't just get out of my work by saying the guy I hand off my stuff to isn't going to do anything with it because even if that was true, at the moment, you're the guy not doing anything. You're still required to do your job regardless of whether the guy after you is doing his. And if you do your job, and it we can see that the person in the next step of the process isn't doing anything, then we can address that problem.'"
