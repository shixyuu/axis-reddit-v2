        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'I’ve been doing this since the termination of my grants earlier this year - riding out the remainder of my contract while I look for other jobs and research gigs. My university likewise said I can keep my position if I bring in money to cover my salary, but only gave me and my faculty colleagues ~10 weeks to do that. Won’t let us spend the 500K + in residuals we brought to them, treated my staff colleagues terribly… so yeah, I don’t feel bad about it.\nEdit: I’m not sure how much they’re micromanaging your activity - mine doesn’t. But if they press you, just say you’re looking for opps. Or submit half-assed proposals.'"
