Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'How is it quiet quitting lmao, it's literally rational working. The company doesn't give a fuck about you so why should you? You work to live, not the other way around.\nI'm doing what I'm requested to do in my work hours and not a thing more. Why would I do extra when I'm not paid for the extra lmao.\nManagers/companies/directors need to get their head out of their asses cause they have no clue how the world works.'"
