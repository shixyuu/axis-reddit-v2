        "In response to 'Bingo.\nLots of people look at employment as something that happens TO them, not something they agree to.\nIf they want more, they should give more.\nIf you want more, you should be prepared to do more.\nAnything in between is just an attempt to take advantage of the relationship (which happens too often)', a user said: 'Happens both ways.\nI've worked for employers who wanted me to take on more work but without paying more.  To be clear they wanted me to expand my responsibilities and work extra hours with no increase in pay or compensation in anyway.\nI said no.\nBut employers who have empowered me as a manager to offer OT to my team to make deadlines etc.  Strangely I have no issue getting team members to put in extra time and we (almost) always make deadline.\nSure I have to answer to senior management as to why we needed the OT to make it but I always have my analysis of the work package from bidding which never matches their very optimistic appraisal of what can get done.  I just document everything and I have never had an issue.'"
