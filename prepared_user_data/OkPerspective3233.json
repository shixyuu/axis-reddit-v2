        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'I have done this as well, I’ve outsourced to Instacart. I hate that it’s extra money, but what I save in time and frustration is worth it to me. My job involves being around a lot of people and I really would rather not spend even more time around people, if I don’t have to. I tip the shoppers well so it’s worth it to them too. I have to outsource dinner still but that’s the next step ☺️ Hubby already took over 2 nights…pizza another night…ok 4 more to go 😉'"
