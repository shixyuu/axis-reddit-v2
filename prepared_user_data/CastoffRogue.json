        "In response to 'Has anyone here ever worked somewhere, had a supervisor quit, then had to do the supervisor's job, but while being told they can't actually make you officially the supervisor yet, just so they don't have to give you a pay rise? I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'Did this for Walmart all the time. Started out as a cashier.  Started doing \"Backup CSM\", basically still a cashier, just doing a Customer Service Manager's job.  Became a CSM finally after 6 months by busting my ass off.  At one point I was 1 of 2 CSMs on the front end when there should have been 6 to 8.  Busted my ass for years because turnover is high, then applied for a higher management position.  Got passed over for an 18yo kid who was there for the store remodel.  His first job ever.  Found out his Mommy and Daddy worked at the Home Office.  Same kid got to move up to Assistant Manager training within 2 years.  We would have these yearly surveys and one of the questions basically asked if moving up in the company was based on work ethic or by who you know, every time after that I'd answer \"by who you know\".   This was at Store #1 near the Home Office itself.\ntldr; \nWalmart does this shit, Fuck Walmart!'"
