        "In response to 'The CCP has been manipulating their currency for years but I never understood how it worked.\n1) What was China doing to their currency and how did it impact the currency?\n2) Why is it not working this time around?', a user said: 'If no one wants the currency to buy chinese goods or financial assets the value drops. They can counter this by removing a bunch from the market (reverse money printing). They do so by buying up circulating yuan with their foreign reserves like dollars. But they usually hold dollars in the form of treasuries so they make some yield while it sits. So they first have to sell those treasuries for dollars to buy yuan. This makes treasury values go down and rates up (amongst other reasons).\nBut a more expensive yuan makes it more expensive to buy Chinese products (vs say American or Mexican products). So China's economy slows. Also, higher US Treasury rates creates even more demand for dollars to earn higher yields.\nSo in defending it they also make the situation of people not wanting yuan even worse. So they have to defend harder, which sells more bonds, which slows demand and raises US rate differential, which makes people want Yuan less, etc.\nSo either they have to stimulate real demand home or abroad, or they have to relent and let it devalue like they did in the 2010's which had some market repercussions.'"
