        "In response to 'Very technical role, my “people” manager doesn’t know shit about the tech. I say a task takes 20 hours that only takes 15 minutes and she takes it as gospel. God help me if I ever get a manager that is even remotely knowledgeable in the field', a user said: 'Tech field or no it has been my experience that supervisors rarely know how to do your jobs b or even what your job is. Heck my supervisor keeps telling me I need to improve my metrics and when I ask what they are she says “ I don’t really know” and then I would ask how can I improve them and she says, “I’m not really sure” and I say what are these measures based on and she says, “ well I need to jump off this call, I have another meeting.” I didn’t hear from her for another year when she called to discuss why her turnaround survey was bad and I said”I dont know” and then she asked how she can improve to get a better survey and I said “ I’m not sure”….'"
