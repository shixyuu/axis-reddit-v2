        "In response to 'This \"quiet quitting\" thing has such a weird name. It's literally \"Doing your job.\"\nYou don't pay the price of a 97' hyundai and expect the performance of a F1. If you want you car to run at that speed, well... it will certainly cost you.\nI really hate how this corporate hustle culture eventually became a scam to have workers give their 100% while giving them a 20% salary. What was the point of that in the first place? Why did we allow ourselves to be used like that? I remember people shitting on the french for being on strike all the time, supposedly being \"lazy\" and demanding their rights. Guess what? They are correct and we were the suckers.\nPaying X and getting X\n10\ndoes not apply anywhere else in the market, (certainly not profesional services) why are employees any different?', a user said: 'The French have a single culture to rally around, and probably think more in groups, whereas America is \"fuck you got mine\", and if you can find a sucker to dupe, you bilk him for all you can.'"
