        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'When I was younger and visited Japan, my relatives in the city seemed like half dead zombies and I only would see them in the evening for brief dinners where they could barely muster topics for conversation. Flash forward to last year, my uncle who was an executive at a large company, took me to conveyer belt sushi at 5 PM on a Tuesday. Insisted we just go ham on whatever, drink multiple rounds of sake, wander around the neighborhood, pet cats, visit/annoy the neighbors. He then told me his company lost 10% of his revenue, but hey everyone tried their best and sometimes this happens and no one needs to be ashamed. My younger cousins all seem to be aiming to just do their jobs 9-5, enjoy thrifting, gardening, and dream of opening up a cheese cake shop or community garden. At a certain point the burnout just gets too much and you just look at what makes life worth living.'"
