According to the definition I just read, “quiet quitting” is when you only engage in work during work hours and “opting out of tasks beyond one's assigned duties and/or becoming less psychologically invested in work”.\n…so literally doing what you’re paid to do? Pfft, fuck most of those companies man. I just went from a shitty company that treated everyone like garbage to one that treats us like gold and the level the employees “engage” with the work is night and day.'"
