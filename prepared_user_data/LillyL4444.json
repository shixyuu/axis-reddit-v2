        "In response to 'LOL …\nHORSESHIT\nits the demographic hole of Boomer retirements and the small size of Gen X that we have known about for decades\n“The crisis we could see coming”\nhttps://www.marketplace.org/2023/08/31/labor-shortages-baby-boomer-retirements/\nThe demographic shift Piper’s preparing for in his business has been predicted for decades. “This was the crisis we could see coming,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a consulting firm focused on small- and medium-sized businesses. “The conditions that prevailed for almost our entire lives — excess supply of labor caused by the size of the baby boom — has now come to an end.”\n“The onset of the pandemic, with the acceleration of the retirement of the boomers,” Brusuelas continued, “has created a confluence of events where we have a labor shortage that’s verging on a crisis, that’s going to cause big changes in firms, with respect to wages and flexibility, and public policy.”\nWorkers age 25 to 54 have largely returned to the workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that group’s labor force participation rate, or LFPR, was 83.4% in July 2023, up slightly from 83% in February 2020. But participation among older workers, those 55 and up, remains 1.7 percentage points lower than it was before the pandemic (38.6% in July 2023, down from 40.3% in February 2020). The LFPR for those 65 and over has fallen 1.5 percentage points.', a user said: 'Right? Still desperate to find people for my medical office… and we mainly attract younger women with no degrees who are strictly hourly. There’s no such thing as quiet quitting or reducing hours, it is what it is. We’ll hire and trains HS grads from scratch, or also happy to hire people with MA certificates or 2 year LPN degrees.\nProblem is, there aren’t as many women age 20-30 as there used to be.'",
        "In response to 'Or your pay isn't competitive.', a user said: 'What would you say a competitive salary would be to hire a new HS grad as a receptionist with no prior experience, in a medium COL Midwest city? Assume of course that full benefits and paid vacation etc are included.'",
        "In response to 'Enough for them to afford a 1 bedroom home in your local area.\nIf you think you can lower their pay because they're young and inexperienced, or because they still live with their parents, then that's why. Rent costs the same to someone with experience than one without.', a user said: 'Okay, looks there are several 1 bedrooms near the office available for $800 a month, according to apartments.com. If we assume rent will be 30% of income, that’s $16.66 hourly wage. So all of our staff all make a living wage for the area.'"
