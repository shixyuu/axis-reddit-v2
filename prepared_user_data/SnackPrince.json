        "In response to 'For real... I legit got accused of something similar today.\nFor context, my job is implementing this strict policy about lateness and call offs. Which is fine, but then I asked if this policy would be in effect if we traveled to other (further away) sites and they said yes.\nTo which I said I would probably be uninterested in helping other sites that were further from my home because I wouldn't want to risk being fired for tardiness for trying to go above and beyond and helping someone else. All that would take is a badly timed snow storm, or a flood for the freeways to be backed up. And then they said that I was doing the bare minimum and \"coasting\" and that I needed to take more \"initiative\". Even though I am still doing the same EXACT work I have been doing all along, and travel isn't in my contract, i just helped for overtime.. When I asked for specific feedback, they couldn't give me ANY instances, or specific things I need to work on.', a user said: 'So you're given zero incentive but maximum potential punishment. Yeah that's a big nope'"
