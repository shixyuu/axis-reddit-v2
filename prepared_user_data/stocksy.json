        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'As an employee, it’s what I’ve been doing for the past 20 years without realising it has a name.\nI don’t currently have anyone working for me, but when I did I never expected them to put in as much effort as I did. As the business owner, it’s totally unreasonable to expect employees to care as much about the business as you do.'"
