        "In response to 'It’s the most idiotic move as a business - recruiting costs a fortune, especially when you take into account loss of institutional knowledge and the time necessary to ramp up proficiency.\nSpending a dollar to save a dime.', a user said: 'Well… sort of. The logic is different if you are a traded company.\nAt a traded entity, if you push employee costs down the line but still make sure you keep shareholders whole and happy, you will get investment… so you get more money to spend incorrectly.\nEven though you will turn over employee resources and pay a premium to get them back, so will your competitors in many cases. If everyone is in a cycle of purging and retooling personnel, then the pain is not seen as self-inflicted. It all seems to be “environmental” at that point… you know, the old “Government is paying people to sit on their asses so nobody wants to work anymore” line of critical thinking 🙄\nSo why don’t boards and shareholders cry about turnover? Sometimes they do; but most of the time they don’t see the impact because their shares still payout. Turnover may even be where the gains they see that period originated.'"
