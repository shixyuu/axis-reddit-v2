        "In response to 'My schools is having a “fright night” tonight for Halloween. Little games and activities for students to come and do things for fun and win candy or whatever else. I’ve said multiple times I’m not going or volunteering because it’s not in my contract. “But it’s for the kids.” Of course it is, and they will be fine without me there', a user said: 'So is \"regular school\" and \"Disneyland\" and all sorts of things but you still need to pay staff to work there. Feel free to organize parent volunteers (and yes apparently that's complicated now- but again, that's someone else's job to figure all of that out).'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'I say \"doing your job... within your contractual hours\". But I work in a union state where that means something (and there's still not enough time in the day).'"
