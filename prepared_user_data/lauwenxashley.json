        "In response to 'It's wild to me the amount of people that order things and then mysteriously fall off the face of the earth.\nBe by your phone!!!\nBe at your fuckin door when I get there!!!\nQuit wasting my time!!!', a user said: 'i always do deliveries for the first slot in the morning so most things are in stock & the first handful of times, i was sleeping when the delivery driver was sending me messages (usually just the greeting & i left your order by your door message, but sometimes it was substitutes as well). there have been a couple of times where i didn’t like the substitutes that they chose, but i still tipped them & left them a good review bc they did their job & the issue was on me. if i’m at work while the person is shopping, i’ve started to send them a message to let them know that i might not respond while they’re shopping & that they have the green light for whatever substitute they choose. it’s not always possible to be on your phone bc life happens but it’s 100% possible to include a note or a message to give the delivery driver a heads up. obviously, orders w alcohol are a different situation lol.'"
