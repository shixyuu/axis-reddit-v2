        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'Quiet quit, dropping from 50 productive hours to about 20-25 and I haven't experienced any negative impacts. Still getting large annual increases and bonuses. Feedback hasn't changed either.'"
