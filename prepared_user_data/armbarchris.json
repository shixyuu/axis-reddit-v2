        "In response to 'Original Post: what's up with quiet quitting? I've heard this term \"quiet quitting\" over the last year, indicating that people doing their jobs are somehow not doing enough. If the minimum requirement isn't enough, shouldn't the minimum be reset?  I feel like I'm misunderstanding the meaning of this term.\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/what-is-quiet-quitting-6743910', a user said: 'Answer: It's the new trendy way for cooperations to imply that millennials are inferior and destroying the company because they aren't bootlicking enough. Basically it means things like \"not volunteering for unpaid overtime\" and \"going home when your shift is over\" and generally treating your job like a job instead of slavery.'",
        "In response to 'When our dean said that we should remain open longer for students to study over the break, he said that faculty and staff should volunteer their time to keep the building open after hours. He called it an act of service.', a user said: '\"Act of service\" pssshhhh tell him to service dez nuts.'"
