Don't let it become an acceptable term [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/fwj0foce59k91.jpg', a user said: 'Agree. It's not quiet quitting. It's frankly just doing the job you get paid for. There's no benefit in working for free so why should you?'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'I totally agree!\nA healthy work life balance is important.\nIf your employer was obligated to pay you for all the extra work, they wouldn't bother you to do extra work.\nFree labor isn't honorable and doesn't benefit you personally.'"
