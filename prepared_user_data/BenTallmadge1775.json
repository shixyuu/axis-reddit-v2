        "In response to 'I work in a union shop, and when my supervisors piss me off I do\nexactly\nwhat I'm told. . . . . . . And\nONLY\nwhat I'm told.\nWorking as instructed still means you need to be instructed.\nI also regularly admonish new hires for working off the clock. They don't start paying us until exactly start time, so if you come in early, even if you punch in, they don't pay you until you were scheduled to start.\nI think this is a stupid rule, so when I get there early I sit on the conveyor belt that is required for work to happen and play on my phone. They can't turn the belt on if someone is on it, so if they want to start working they have to ask me to move.', a user said: 'Snark aside in the post, sitting on equipment meant for manufacturing or production is typically a safety violation, regardless of whether it’s in use. So watch out, this seems like it’s ripe for a manager to get a wild hair and write you up or fire you for violating safety rules.\nAs for not starting until you’re being paid, totally agree with that. Time is valuable to everyone. Also I’m surprised that leadership is not on people for working off the clock as it is also a violation of labor regs.'"
