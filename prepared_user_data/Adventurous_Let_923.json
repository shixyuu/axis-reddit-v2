        "In response to 'This broke me-submitting future lesson plans. Well, it wasn’t the only thing but it was a big thing. I went from full-time to subbing because one a “Next Day Only” and my admin wanted a week of plans submitted the Friday before. And my prep was all meetings with admin to talk about my observations and why my focus walls weren’t current. Fuckkity fuck that.', a user said: 'I’m right there with you. It’s not worth it.'",
        "In response to 'I have been \"working to contract\" for years now. If something doesn't get done then it doesn't get done. Whenever I am asked to do extra during my prep I always tell my admin upfront the opportunity cost for taking away my time:\n\"Oh you want me to plc today? Well, okay then my lesson plans will be late this week, chief. Oh I need to sub a class? Sure thing bossman, but my grades aren't going to be turned in by the deadline.\"\nI won't be winning teacher of the year by doing this but who cares about that. I said enough is enough when my daughter was born several years ago and I was trying to hold her while grade papers. I reclaimed my evenings and weekends for myself and my family and I haven't looked back.\nIf all teachers would do this then it would force\nthem\nto change how the education system is operated.', a user said: 'You are right on point. Like I commented this is what ultimately led me to leave teaching last year. It was exactly what was said about admin plus all the teachers around me wanting to kiss the admin’s ass and do whatever they said. Like wtf?! We should be in this together. Do you not have a life outside of this classroom?! I’m ranting now, but it was like I was in the twilight\n Zone. I literally felt like I was going crazy.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting could be the best thing for education. Everyone's definition of quiet quitting is different. Mine is not working outside of your contract ours. Work from 7am to 3pm and then you're done. No lesson planning outside of class, no chaperoning, no working gates unless it involves extra pay.\nWhen you ignore these boundaries, you overwork yourself, can't sustain the position, and you end up leaving the profession and in return your students lose a great educator.\nIf you can't do all the tasks a school asks for you to do during the day, that is not the fault of you, it is the fault of your boss requiring too much of you. If you continue doing these tasks outside of your hours you are effectively telling your admin that this is okay.\nWhen you put your value in working extra hours because it makes you feel like you are \"doing it for the kids\" you are doing the opposite long term. The precedent that teachers have to put so much time in outside of work is toxic and leads to teacher burnout. A shortage of teachers is not good for any educational system.\nI'd like to blame admin, government, or students but the easiest fix is in the teachers themselves. When we overwork ourselves, we effectively hurt education. Only work your hours and if you can't get your work done, let your admin know you don't have the time. Healthy work life balance can keep us going and bring more teachers into the profession.\nEdit: Sorry y'all. I didn't realize how problematic the term \"quiet quitting\" is. I am glad though that it brought some attention to the post which led to some good discussion. I will use a different term from here on out and I am happy a lot of you only work your hours or work your contract.', a user said: 'This was so beautifully said.
