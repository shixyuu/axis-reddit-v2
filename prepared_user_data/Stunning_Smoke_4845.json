        "In response to 'The loss of 2 hours of my Monday alone adds noticeable stress to my life. It means that in order to get the grocery shopping done for the week I have to rush and still get to the store later when it is busier so that grocery shopping takes more time and mental energy.\nIt also means I then have to go straight from work to shopping to preparing dinner. No down time from 6 am when I wake up to 7 pm after dinner is eaten. Every Monday. When I was working remotely, I got an hour more sleep, got to do grocery shopping either over lunch or before everyone else was off work, got a little afternoon time before preparing meals.\nThat's just Monday.', a user said: 'And if you do anything after work then you don’t get downtime until after that. Every Tuesday I wake up at 6am, work until 4pm, get home at 5ish, scarf down my food, then run to practice where I am gone until around 10pm. Then I shower, go to bed and get ready for work the next day :/'",
        "In response to 'What do you practice?', a user said: 'Historical combat, mostly rapier right now, but I’m working on getting a suit of armor to get into heavy fighting.\nIt’s a lot of fun, but oh also means I get no breaks on the days I do it :/'"
