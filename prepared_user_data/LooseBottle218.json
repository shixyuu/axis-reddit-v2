As in, you show up, satisfy the business requirements and leave. In regulated spaces that's \"doing the minimum\". In unregulated spaces that includes deliberately taking more time to accomplish regular work, behaving neutrally with your peers (instead of opportunistically), signing on to meetings but checking out, etc.\nI think whether the employee cares if it's sabotage changes the vitriol but not the terminology.'"
