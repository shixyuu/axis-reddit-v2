        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on ‚Äúquiet quitting‚Äù? Is it something you‚Äôve been doing for a while or something you‚Äôve recently started implementing? For those who don‚Äôt know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what‚Äôs asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Is this a real thing? I just learned this term now, and frankly I would hate for my employer to think that's what I'm doing. I'm sorry, I love the work that I do....but I work to live, I don't live to work. People need work-life balance. Period.\nI work in long-term care and I have noticed there's an attitude that someone is lazy because they aren't doing 16 hour shifts every day. I hate it. I'm sorry if I don't want to run my body into the ground or end up having a meltdown thanks to being burnt out. I am so tired of this attitude that someone is a saint because they kill themselves working. Most of the people I know who do that are absolutely miserable, they're miserable to be around (not to mention a terrible teammate usually because they're exhausted already from working all day so I'd end up doing most of the work anyway) and they're too damn stubborn to stop working. Then they wonder why their health is suffering! It drives me mental.\nMy job is very physically and emotionally taxing, and like I said, I love it and I know I'm good at it. I've had families comment when their loved ones dies, they can tell I care because I'm crying with them.\nBut going on this term, I guess I'm a terrible worker. So be it then!\nSorry to rant, this whole thing just got me a little riled up apparently. Being pregnant also seems to have me speaking my mind a little more, or so my fiance says. ü§£'"
