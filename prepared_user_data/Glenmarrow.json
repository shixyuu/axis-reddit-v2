        "In response to 'The debates as they exist are a dog and pony show.\nA substantive debate would have to be spread over multiple evenings, multiple hours, each one focused deeply on a particular issue. But Americans largely wouldn't tune in to watch that.\nInstead we get two hours of candidates talking over each other, moderators refusing to enforce their own rules, and candidates only get 60 seconds at a time to answer complex questions that cover the entire spectrum of issues. It's just a sound bite factory and nothing more. Most of the candidates won't even stay on topic or answer the questions straight and the moderators do nothing to keep it on track.', a user said: 'IIRC back in 2012, the debates were primarily focused on specific issues. The one where Obama pulled his “Uh, the ‘80s called” line out on Romney was a FoPo focused debate.'"
