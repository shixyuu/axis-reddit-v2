Instead of going above and beyond their job duties, these employees simply fulfill their basic responsibilities and are often reluctant to work overtime.<\nQQ is scaling your effort back to the point where your\nonly\ngoal at work is not getting fired. “Selecting not to work OT” is at the opposite end of this spectrum.\nWhoever explained Quiet Quitting to this poindexter hasn’t talked to anyone who stands up at work in their life.'"
