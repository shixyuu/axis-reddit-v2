        "In response to 'Original Post: Got my boomer parents to say I should quiet quit. So I started a new job 8 days, 6 business day, ago. This is CapitalOne, by the way. Today, my HR manager gives me a call and tells me that I can either take a 25% pay cut or leave my job. I'm not even done onboarding yet, as they want me to watch nearly 40h of trainings along with applying for all my permissions without telling me what they are. On top of that, this was always meant to be a hold-me-over type of jobs, as I already took about a 30% pay cut for this job, but I had been unemployed for nearly a year, and wanted to stop bleeding money. And so I talked afterwards, in private, to some of my team members, and apparently this is just normal behavior for the company.\nMy parents gave me a call for the holidays after work. They asked me how the new job was going, and I told them about it. Both my parents are avid Fox News watcher, and had been complaining about the \"quiet quitting epidemic\" for sometime. My dad, was like, oh you should quit and find a better opportunity, but my mom interrupted my dad and told me that I should \"Take the offer, look for a new job, and do the bare minimum at my current position\". I informed her that, that is literally \"quiet quitting\", and she without missing a beat told me to \"quiet quit\" and my dad soon followed suit.\nMy parents might be pushing 80, but I'm glad I finally got them to see the light of how messed up our economy is. And I feel very proud about it, prouder than most other things in my life, and I made discoveries in my industry that fundamentally changed it, and you know what, I feel more proud about this, than I do that.', a user said: 'My parents turn 70 next year. They  believe if the company is not earning your loyalty then don't go above and beyond. 20 years ago ( feel old now) I worked a job that gave you 5 one week blocks of sick time. No doctors note or anything. The Vp we used to see weekly would check in to see if anyone was going to be sick ahead of time. Dude Mark I worked with told him he was felling sick and would be out next week. Vp o building the new deck...Thumbs up from Mark and the Vp said cool I will be around extra in case I am needed. That Vp and two other ones I have missed.'"
