        "In response to 'was crying the other day about they donâ€™t enjoy being around witnesses anymore\nInteresting comment and thanks for sharing that. Me and the PIMI spouse have talked about this for a really long time now. Basically, that many of the JW relationships we have are very shallow and the people that we can choose as friends in JW Land have so many problems that is difficult to really be friends with anyone.\nJWs are either taking depression medication, alcoholics, mentally unstable or in many cases trying to survive while basically living in poverty. How are you going to develop close friendships if the people you are picking from have an endless number of problems.', a user said: 'I get what you are saying but the idea of disqualifying a friendship because someone isn't financially well off or because they need antidepressants is kinda shallow too, and you'll be severely limiting yourself JW or not. Plenty of non JWs deal with personal issues while still being good people who are more than capable of maintaining quality friendships.\nJWs struggle to develop genuine friendships because the entire structure of social relationships is fucked in the org. You constantly have to have a wall up because you are encouraged to rat on each other, so you never have any level of vulnerability or honesty brought in. JW friendships are usually borne of circumstance and obligation, which is why managing anything beyond a surface level acquaintance while in is a rarity.'"
