Seems like every single adult above a certain age knows a guy who was so desperate to work at a particular place that they cleaned it for free for months until they got hired.\nEither:\nThey're all making it up\nThey all knew the same guy\nThere are an unexpectedly large number of people who are a unique combination of dumb and desperate.\nReality check:\nMost places won't let someone handle a broom for them unless they're employed.  Liability issues\nMost places will kick out the person who arrives with a broom to start cleaning\nReally bad PR\nLiability issue\nThe guy who starts doing that risks getting a trespass warning.', a user said: 'My daughter (16) was going to help her friend at work. \nI asked her how much they are going to pay her for the help.

        "In response to 'I really hate how this corporate hustle culture eventually became a scam\nto have workers give their 100% while giving them a 20% salary. What\nwas the point of that in the first place? Why did we allow ourselves to\nbe used like that?\nBecause we were trained by boomers, who benefitted from the extra work that they did.  Back in the 50's through the early 80's, hard work would get you ahead.  If Tim the stockboy at the local grocer saw a task that needed to be done that wasn't his task and he did it anyway, he would be rewarded with a raise and a promotion.  Now if Tim the stockboy sees a task that needs to be done and it isn't his task and does it anyway, it becomes part of his job and there's no raise.  I have lived through that.  I did extra work for one company and it was beneficial for a lot of people.  When I asked why my compensation did not reflect that when it came time for a raise, my manager said that what I had done was part of my job now and I should not expect an increase for it.\nBasically the way we were trained to work was based on the way things were between about 4 to 7 decades ago, not the way they are now.', a user said: 'Even when I started 30 plus years ago you got your raise based on your evaluation.\nIt was based on a percentage of what your current wage was. Like a great eval was 5% increase a good one was 3% and a bad one was like 1%.\nIt made you want to work harder. Of course 5% of $7 was a joke but you knew the more you made the more you will make.\nThey also offered “merit” increases. If you asked for they would give you another Eval and if it was good you got another increase.\nThat doesn’t exist anymore. And now a lot of places have a wage cap and you will never make more.'"
