        "In response to 'Nope. But there are no fix hours. I usually go to office at 2 pm and come back by 5-6 pm. At office, everyone has individual projects so no one is concerned what the other person is doing. I mostly sit and listen to songs and do some personal projects', a user said: 'You do personal projects at workplace? How? People in India are way too nosy. I once tried to do some learning with an online course and every random bugger would ask me what I was doing.'",
        "In response to 'i mean, he said no one knows what he is working on anyways...', a user said: 'True.. but with most places having \"open\" offices, your screen is in view for the entire office. Or whoever walks behind you. In my case, I had more people from other teams who were acquainted with me put their noses into what I was doing than my teammates. People from other teams actually had no clue what I did on a day to day basis anyway.'",
        "In response to 'cant we brush them off with random high level info rather than going into exact detail about what it is..\nwhy would it matter what we tell them? They're not even someone you are reporting to..', a user said: 'If only life was that simple.. words travel up the grapevine. Even if they aren't directly related to us, they talk to others and mention about this. Not necessarily with malicious intent. But somehow, it always always reaches the ears of someone you report to. And even if you aren't doing anything that could indicate you might quit, people might interpret it that way. Even if you have already finished all your work and are just learning more to not waste time, the impression they get is that you are wasting time or doing something personal in your work time. While getting paid by company.'"
