        "In response to 'Original Post: Minnesota among top 5 states for quiet quitting’ [External Link]: https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-quiet-quitting-jobs-2022', a user said: 'It really bugs me how some of the older generation just seem to be ignorant to the fact that they were most likely being taken advantage of at jobs when they were younger.  In this generation now, asking someone to do more work means you should be paying them more if they’re taking on additional tasks.  Higher ups love to dangle that carrot in front of people and say that hard work and going the extra mile will lead to good things in the workplace where all it really does is burn you out more.  If someone needs me to take on additional tasks for like a week or two.  Fine I can happily do that.  But once it starts becoming a normal thing, that’s when you need to put your foot down and demand the pay that goes along with it'"
