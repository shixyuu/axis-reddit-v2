        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I worked for a bedding manufacturer for 21 years. I don't drive, and during that time they moved premises twice. Both times further from my place of residence. After the 2nd move it was taking me 4.5 hrs each way to get to and from work via public transport.\nI managed to stick it out for 12 months but in the end the 9 hour commute every day was what forced me to regretfully leave. I did a few odd jobs closer to home for the next 6 months but nothing that I could see myself long term in.\nDuring that time I was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Drs have given me about 10 months to go but the terminal diagnosis made it super easy to get approved for DSP.'"
