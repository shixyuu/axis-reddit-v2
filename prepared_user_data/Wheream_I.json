Makes way more sense to apply it to someone actually not doing anything and just waiting to get fired.', a user said: 'Naw, take it from a quiet quitter - it’s quiet quitting.\nI make about $105k/yr in a job I hate. I phone it in so hard, and only do the bare minimum to not get fired. I work from home and honestly work maybe 10 hours a week. I hate myself for it, but… it’s good pay for essentially zero effort…\nCould I do better? 100%. But I honestly just can’t be bothered.'"
