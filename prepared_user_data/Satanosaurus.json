        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'I’m pretty sure it’s called quiet quitting because the term is not intuitively accurate, thereby inciting a lot of discourse about it which effectively makes it a lot more popular and talked about.'"
