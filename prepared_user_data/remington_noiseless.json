        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'Employers have no right to complain if you just do exactly what you're paid to do. If they expect more then they should pay you more.\nHowever, don't expect to get promoted if you're just doing the bare minimum. I would say that you shouldn't expect a big payrise either, but the only way to get a significant payrise without a promotion seems to be to change jobs anyway.\nSomething worth reading is\nthe gervais principle\nsince it explains this situation. Basically, people who would normally be in the clueless layer have realised their situation and are moving to the loser layer. Maybe it's been the pandemic that's sparked the realisation - perhaps after years of being told they're the company's most important asset they got laid off or weren't paid when the pandemic hit? Who knows.'"
