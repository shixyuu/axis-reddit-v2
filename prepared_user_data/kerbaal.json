        "In response to 'Correlation doesn't imply causation.\nI suspect it's far more likely that there is a common factor at play (i.e. open-mindedness, greater awareness of personal priorities, greater awareness of their own self-worth, higher priority placed on personal goals and relationships versus professional) which leads members of the identified group to both (a) use psilocybin, and (b) give less fucks about work.', a user said: 'I think you have it backwards. Its not use psilocybin->give less fucks about work.\nIts more like use psilocybin.... give more fucks about the rest of your life that you have been sacrificing for work. Why are you working if you don't get to enjoy life too?'"
