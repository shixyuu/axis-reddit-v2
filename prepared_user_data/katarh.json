        "In response to 'Yeah, while I have had jobs that are like \"as long as you get your work done you are fine\".  But I've never had a job that says \"do these 3 tasks and only these 3 tasks and then fuck off for the rest of the business day.\"', a user said: 'Mine is \"do what we ask you to do.  Then be available during business hours if we have run out of stuff for you to do.  You wanna mop the floors, we don't care, just have slack on.\"'",
        "In response to 'I've worked for places that literally have as part of the job duties:\nAnd any other task as assigned by your supervisor during business hours.\nAnd every morning the supervisors say \"don't screw up.  Be proactive.  Always be doing something for the company.\"', a user said: 'Unless they explicitly state what that something is, it's going to be nothing.\nI'm sure the world is full of people pretending to do things, to avoid being assigned something that would be real work.'",
        "In response to 'This is fucking stupid.  \"Quiet quitting\" includes this up until the act of QUITTING THE JOB.   Without the quitting part, there is no \"quiet quitting.\"', a user said: 'It's daring the employer to fire you.'"
