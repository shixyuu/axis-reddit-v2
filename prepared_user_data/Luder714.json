        "In response to 'All credit cards make their cash off of drowning poor people in debt and killing what little chance they had to claw their way into the middle class. In the US the only higher cause of bankruptcy is medical debt (another ridiculous system designed to drown the poor). They also take a huge chunk of the middle class and ruin their future; forcing them and the next generation into poverty.\nAll credit cards are ran by scum, it’s a purposely evil system.', a user said: 'What do you mean by taking the next gen into poverty?  I got loans in my name only for my kids’ college and they die with me. They are debt free and I plan to keep it that way.\nThey all have jobs to pay for expenses and some rent but they are not going to start 80k in debt. I currently have 140k in student loans between my MBA and their college and I have 1 more to go.'"
