        "In response to 'Basically just doing the bare minimum, not making ridiculous sacrifices for an indifferent boss. Basically just mentally checking out of the grinding mindset most employers seem to crave these days.', a user said: 'Oh so doing just your job you agreed to for the pay they agreed to for that job.\nThat seems more than fair to me, and tbh how everyone should be performing.\nThe more ‘extra work’ people take on for no extra money to be a ‘team player’ just leads to fewer and fewer people employed, and only the company benefits.\nI think everyone should do this, to be honest.\nThanks for the definition!'",
        "In response to 'Yeah I think the \"quiet quitting\" thing is kinda an attempt to subvert people's opinions. Phrase it that way to cast a negative light on people who have a healthy relationship with their work.', a user said: 'Yes!'",
        "In response to 'Yeah, the more I hear about this quiet quitting thing, the more it just sounds like \"working to rule\". Definitely changes the connotation of what's going on.', a user said: 'Yep but that doesn’t make normal people look enough like assholes, so I guess they had to make up a phrase for it.'"
