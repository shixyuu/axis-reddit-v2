        "In response to 'The youngs at work have made it EXTREMELY clear that they don't care about anybody's input if you're over 40. We are the enemy as far as they are concerned. Fine, make stupid, expensive mistakes because you don't want to listen to the olds tell about the four other times we tried the same thing. Don't care anymore, I guess they they can figure it out for themselves. Or not. Whatever.', a user said: 'What I fucking hate is when new people come and say how things SHOULD work. Um, yea you’re no genius we all know how it should work. The hard part is changing all the old systems and processes to make it work like that without fucking everything else up. Also, it’s easy to say how things should work when you don’t put the time in to see how it works today - y’know I call that part REALITY. I’m tired of idiots not living in reality and just floating around meeting to look smart.\nThe absolute worst though, and I’m living it right now, is when I’m told HOW TO WORK in a rigid and prescribed way because of something some executive was sold. Here’s the thing, not every way of working works for every project, situation, or person.\nAnyway I won’t let myself get to the quiet quitting place. I’ll speak up, if that doesn’t work then I’ll work around you (pretend or forget things you make me do), and if I’ll else fails I’ll really quit. I’ve quit for way less money at times too. Luckily I always bounce back after some time.'"
