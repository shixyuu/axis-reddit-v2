        "In response to 'We should all start saying that employers who don't give regular wage increases (above inflation) are \"quiet firing\" their employees.', a user said: 'Yeah, all \"quiet quitting\" is, is committing to the language of these economic libertarian types. If an employer has no obligation but to pay people the minimum necessary for them to contribute to profits, then employees have no obligation to work any harder than the bare minimum needed not to be fired. It goes both ways. This country music morality of being proud to bust your back at the Wal-Mart with nothing in life to look forward to but a beer after work isn't sustainable.'"
