        "In response to 'I am ambitious about living life by my own terms. Working a job is a tool to achieve that. And that is exactly how I am treating it.\nI would argue it’s the organisations that lack integrity. And not me. I am working in a fair manner wrt my compensation.\nI always encourage and coach my colleagues to have a backbone and not get trodden all over. And I do believe they’re all happier today than when they were burning the midnight oil daily. Some even sleeping in the office.\nMy company was WFO. In fact just being in office used to be counterproductive and people used to feel they’ve done something because they are in office, without actually being productive.\nI am providing value to the company, just relative to my compensation. I don’t feel there’s a lack of integrity in that.', a user said: 'The problem in India, people don't treat job as a job.\nIt's just a job.\nWhile I acknowledge that there are some passionate folks who want their job to be their life, expecting everyone to be at the same level and aim/ambition shame them is frankly not the way to go.\nOne life, there's more to it than just a job , let us live the way we want to.'"
