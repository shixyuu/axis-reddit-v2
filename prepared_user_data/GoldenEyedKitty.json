[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/zyuip9dwb68a1.png', a user said: 'I don't think they are the same thing.  A work to rule strike is an attempt to slow down as much as possible without violating the rules, often by using the rules that are otherwise ignored because they slow things down.\n\"Quiet quitting\" is a boss complaining an employee isn't go above and beyond their job duties.  Not working free overtime, etc.   Someone just doing their job normally isn't performing a work to rule strike but can still have a boss complain they are quiet quitting because the boss wants more from free.'"
