        "In response to 'As IT, don't you go blaming me.  I am all for doing the bare minimum, that's what I try to do, but yet yall want it for you but not me in IT.  I bust my fucking ass to keep you all afloat and all you do is bitch and whine about me all day long.  They don't give me money to improve, and when they finally do, it's \"DO IT RIGHT FUCKING NOW AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!\" Despite a world wide shortage of chips and shit.  Don't go making someone else life harder to make yours easier.  That's complete and utter bullshit.\nAlso just a fun fact.  I can see everything you do all day long.  I can watch your screen without you knowing, I can look at logs. I can prove you are lying about your blue screen or any other bullshit you try to pull.\nDon't fuck with IT.  I have your back on everything else, but the second you make ME look bad for doing my part, I will throw you to the fucking wolves.', a user said: 'To quote David Brent \"oohh you're hard\"'"
