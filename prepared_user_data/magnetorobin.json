        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'It's not a great term, but like most women/ people in the comments said, we should call it, \"acting your wage\". Why am I lazy if I'm efficient and doing things precisely enough to fit my role? Why should I get coffee for people, wait in the office, work till midnight and never be compensated for that? My family and my personal life is obviously more important to me than anything else. My tombstone won't have extra hours I put in written on it and neither will I have regrets for putting in less hours than necessary on my death bed. I'm not against working hard, but why does hard work must look a certain way? Long hours, sacrificing your private life, mental health and physical health isn't working hard, at least for me.'"
