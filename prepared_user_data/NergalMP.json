It wasn’t until I was gone that I realized just how abusive it was and how far past burned out I was. I knew it was bad while I was there, but I could t see how bad while I was in it.\nMoving on was literally the healthiest thing I’ve ever done for myself. I wish I had done it 10 years earlier.'",

        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Just to defend the good HRs out there...\nFor years I lobbied upper management to change pay scales to avoid us hemorrhaging talent. HR backed me every single time, even produced competitive salary surveys showing the need.\nUpper management thought it would cost to much and never did it. We continued to hemorrhage good people...up to and including me.\nHR were always good guys.'"
