        "In response to '“Quiet quitting” aka “why should an employee go above and beyond for employers who only give them the bare minimum they can get away with?”', a user said: 'Exactly why I haven't put a full 8 hours of solid work in a day since my \"promotion\" with a 5% raise. More responsibility, more tasks, but an inadequate pay increase that doesn't cover the increased cost of living.\nOriginally discussed a 15k salary increase, then it changed to 8k - 12k. Fast forward to my annual review: \"we can only do 5%.\"\nEmpty promises yield empty results.'"
