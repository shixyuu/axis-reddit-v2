        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I've been teaching for a decade and I quiet quit first year lol. the bottom line was I just don't have anything left in the tank when the last bell rings! I only work my contractual hours and I say No without hesitation to almost any kind extras they try rope me in on...Not interested in being a martyr for a broken system that is ultimately indifferent about mental and physical wellbeing.. I've gotten good at winging it and I encourage other teachers to do so also. But lets please stop using phrase \"quiet quitting\" it's just stupid and silly and undermines all  the hard work that we actually do. Let's call it having healthy  boundaries and a life outside of school. I told my admin straight up when  they tried to force extra work on me. \" Look, I love my job, my school and my students but I would be lying if I didn't say I love my family, my free time  and my hobbies even more...\"'"
