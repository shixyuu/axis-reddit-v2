        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Customers never answer their phone until an hour after they receive the messages I give em like 3 mins then I'm out.  Got burnt on too many orders waiting on the queen or king themselves and then spent too much time on an order. Not worth the time for the money.  Then you get these texts from your customer omg you should have contacted me! I didn't get the texts... Yeah you were watching TV not really my problem.  Bro if I was having someone shop at a place that has items 20% of the time I would be all over it but what do I know it's not my money.  I had someone order alcohol to their house and they were 2 hours away from their house and asked if I could wait until they got home.  Lol I was like no.  And then support said do you want to return the alcohol for $2 it was $100+ in booze I was like no I'm good and sold that shit.  You are playing with your own money or doordashes.  We do contact you multiple times and doordash sends multiple notifications.  You just are clearly too lazy to turn your phone up and no we don't need to wait an hour for your generous $8 tip.'"
