        "In response to 'This article doesn't say it, but other articles about the study state:\n​\n\"A total of 61 British companies with around 2,900 workers were enrolled\nin the trial, with employees working an average of 34 hours across four\nday between June and December 2022, all while keeping their existing\nsalary.\"\n​\nSo it's 4 x 8, not 4 x 10.', a user said: 'that is how it should be. I'm not working 4 x 10 hour days.  Study after study shows that only about 5 to 6 hours of true work gets done in a day.  The other 2 are just waiting for the clock to run down because it's a long day.'"
