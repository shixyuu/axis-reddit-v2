        "In response to 'Totally agree.   I think this term is completely mischaracterized and bastardized by Corporate America.\nWhen you tell me someone has \"quiet quit\", I think that person is simply not working to a reasonable standard.  Think doing juuuust enough work to not get fired.\nI feel like corporate America is trying to brainwash us all into thinking otherwise.  Having a work life balance should never be called 'quiet quitting' - yet here we are.  Ceasing to work overtime for nothing is NOT \"quiet quitting'.', a user said: 'I don't even see it as doing \"just enough to not get fired.\" I see it as putting in boundaries with your employer and doing what you are paid to do/your job description and not that plus 1/3 of three other jobs the employer has refused to fill without getting paid more for it.'"
