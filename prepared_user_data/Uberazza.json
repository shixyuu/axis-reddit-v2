I throw in some extra work at month end on my job, my quality is high, and  yet Iget marked down on the \"works and plays well with others\" section of my annual because that acts as a restraining bolt on any increase in compensation. I work 100% remote.', a user said: 'This legit was my last proformance review they call them \"360 reviews\" for added chagrin. \"We were not able to consult your follow workers to get positive feedback from them about you\". \"Thats because all the people I worked for in the last three years all resigned and left around the same time 12 months ago and you didn't replace my team. I have been running my department single handedly, how about a raise?\". \"we are not going to see you here in the office early every day and staying late on the phone to customers belting out positive outcomes\", \"nope and you never will\". I resigned 3 weeks later to go to a much better paying job. And refused to do \"an exit interview\",citing a complete waste of time\". After the blockages in work they replaced me with three discount employees that can barely communicate in English and still to this day I hear from people the other side of the fence give me a smile about the shitshow since I left even almost three years later.'",

Thoughts and prayers.', a user said: 'The only thing they ever truely get uneasy about is one of their minions usurping them and taking their job. Hence why they will always salt the earth behind them when they get lucky and move up so nothing grows back in the place they once were.'"
