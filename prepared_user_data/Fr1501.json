        "In response to 'What does \"quiet quitting\" mean? That's an odd term I've never heard before. Just sounds like this person is lazy and doesn't want to do his job like everyone is expected to.', a user said: 'He has it wrong, quiet quitting is when you do the bare minimum in a job. Like if your job is to pack 100 widgets into a box and you only do that, but everyone goes above and beyond to pack 200. The company likes the unpaid extra work but people in general are tired of propping up companies with free labor for almost no return.\nThe guy in the story is lazy if he is not netting the minimum metric.Â  However I would like to know how OP knows the person is only logging in half the time, maybe he logs in does the minimum and leaves.'"
