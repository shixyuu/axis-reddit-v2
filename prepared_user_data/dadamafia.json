        "In response to 'This!!! I've recently been screwed over on this. I report to a director, and there were several people on his level who actively scoffed at the mention of my bosses name, was met with \"oh God, I'm sorry,\" when I'd introduce myself and explain who my boss is / what group I'm in, frequently asked what my boss actually does day to day, has described him as a cancer to the company, was told by a subordinate \"that really pissed me off, you can go fuck yourself,\" walked out of the building and went home\nand then was promoted\ninto a different team, was told by his boss that all levels of the organization were aware of my bosses inadequacy... and yet... we're going on six years of his poor leadership. Now we've got some new management and he says all of the right fluff to look good and now his words against me carry weight and I'm being taken off higher profile projects and reassigned to administrative duty to support the other team members that are halfway up his ass - despite cross functional teams asking for me to stay on. It's disheartening, and all this is to say that it doesn't matter what anyone thinks of your boss until your boss is fired.', a user said: 'I'm a little concerned about how comfortable everyone is with badmouthing their coworker. Also, why was he not let go if he has been so terrible?'"
