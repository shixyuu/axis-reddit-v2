        "In response to 'Fantastic, I want this on a mug to sip passively aggressively in front of my boss.\n\"Bahamabanana, why didn't you deliver that report last night?\"\n\"Gee whiz, baus, I sure would've, but you asked me to make it a quarter past 4PM\"\nsip\n\"I had to get home in time to make dinner, see?\"', a user said: 'I've been very careful to not allow work hour creep.\nIn someways Covid has made it easier.\nSince moving to a work from home model my response to late emails has been to simply not respond at all. However, if it is a quick request, I'll do the task requested but I'll set Outlook to delay delivery of the email till the next day at some random AM time-frame. (usually something like 8:13 or 9:27 etc)\nIt's the best of both worlds. I establish guidelines by not responding, but also take care of the issue so that in the morning it's not hanging over my head. The task is done, so everyone is happy.\nThe moment someone starts demanding that I respond to out of work hours emails, texts, or phone calls is the moment they can go fuck themselves.'",
        "In response to 'Calling it \"quiet quitting\" is just businesses trying to blame workers for not slaving hard enough for zero extra reward.  Workers are doing what they're paid to do; end of story.', a user said: 'AKA Work-to-rule aka workbook slowdown aka Malicious Compliance aka phoning it in aka etc....etc...etc...\nThis has been something that has existed whenever there has been jobs and those that manage or have power over those doing the job. Nothing new at all.\nRe-framing it as something \"of this generation\" is fkn a lazy phone-it-in bit of \"journalism\" itself.'"
