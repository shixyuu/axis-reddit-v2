        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'No longer performing discretionary effort above and beyond your role is something intelligent employers have recognised for decades as being a symptom of being disengaged. This is why larger companies will run engagement surveys and try to improve engagement because they know it will increase productivity.\n\"Quiet quitting\" is a new term someone has cooked up to try and blame employees for the phenomena and guilt them into putting more discretionary effort in. No doubt because it aligns perfectly to two things:\n1. Media narrative of lazy and entitled younger generations\n2. Social media videos glorifying people being up at 5am and \"grinding\"'"
