        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'Funding it tight for many and they are providing you a floatation device so you have the ability to right your ship, not everyone has an institution that will do that and you shouldn’t take advantage. It’s not necessarily wrong to spend some time while working there to make a plan and start working out your next steps, but I wouldn’t wait 12 months to let them know you are working on an exit strategy.\nIt is unethical to quietly quit if you currently employ anyone else. Give yourself a short amount of time NOW to decide on your next steps. Once you know what your plan is, you need to start moving towards it and not just pretend to be doing what your employers are expecting you to be doing.'"
