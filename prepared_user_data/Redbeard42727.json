        "In response to 'The really dumb thing is that \"work to rule\" is literally just doing what you're paid for. I don't get why it is seen as a bad thing. Why is there an expectation you should go above and beyond? It's a straight contract of money for labour.', a user said: 'Why is there an expectation to go above and beyond? Because that's what a lot of us were taught, by parents, grandparents, what have you. You bust your ass, go above and beyond, bend over backwards and you'll be rewarded for it, which was great... decades ago when it actually worked. For four years I've busted my ass for a small grocery store, and it's gotten me nowhere. The way things used to work is dead and gone, along with any hope us younger folks have of living a life our parents did. There's no houses in our futures, no benefits, no retirement, and for a lot us, no health/dental insurance.\nIt surprised my manager to learn that the only reason I show up now is a paycheck and that's it. I don't care about how neat and tidy the shelves are stocked, how straight the rows of carriages are, or how clean the store is. If it isn't in my job description, I'm not doing it. Don't like it? You can try and write me up, but I'll walk out the door so fast it'll make your head spin and never return because I have nothing to lose. That's one of the best things about getting no insurance through my employer, no 401k, or benefits at all. Firing me would be doing me a favor because I could go somewhere else, and get all the shit they were too greedy to give me.'"
