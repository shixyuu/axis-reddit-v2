Companies are known for their charity and well-treatment of their deserving employees, so I think you're mistaken.', a user said: 'Not sure you're being sarcastic or not. Companies are generous with people they can't easily replace.\nThat doen't mean you need to be a harvard grad (even that is becoming replaceable nowadays), but it does mean you need to put yourself at a crucial chokepoint and make sure you're one of the few who can open that gate in the operation.\nOf course you can't ACT irreplaceable. Then people will replace you out of spite and no matter the cost.\nLet the truth remain unspoken. That's the one you can use for ever.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Then, it's sad to see so many people doing unqualified jobs they hate, for insufficient pay, and that being the norm.\nWith 10 years experience, you should be \"relatively hard\" to replace and still 30-40 years away from retirement. Not \"completely insignificant and replaceable\".\nThat was the situation in 2010 at least.'"
