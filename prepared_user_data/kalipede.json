Am I being quiet-fired everytime my employer only pays me for as many hours as I worked?', a user said: 'It’s a bullshit term. I worked at a startup and the cto was asking me why I’m not working like the ceo there (get up at 7am and use product until 10pm every day)'",
        "In response to '\"Because that's not my job? Because I'm not paid like him? take your pick\"\nIf you want to have 2 employees, hire 2 employees. Shockingly it's actually cheaper than paying the overtime(yes, yes, I know they probably don't want to pay you overtime. They probably figure that they can exempt you somehow, but not paying you isn't going to motivate you to work those extra hours any faster).', a user said: 'Salary job. Doesn’t matter how many hours I worked overtime they wouldn’t have paid.\nIt’s a stupid ass startup mentality.'"
