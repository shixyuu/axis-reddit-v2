        "In response to 'Its weird because if these are misdemeanors (which reckless and speed contest are), they're jury trial cases, which means the judge doesn't convict or acquit, the jury does.\nI'm gonna be honest, this level of knowledge should be something any cop more than a year or so should know simply because they have testified in front of a jury.  Which makes me question if these cops are real or imagined.  If they are real, it gives me serious questions about SFPDs knowledge and training by the standards of the average cop.', a user said: 'Jury trial. Right. Like there's court room for 100 misd 23103 / 23109 vc cases. I agree with the sentiment but it ain't happening. Most would be unregistered motor vehicle cite and tow. Which I totally support.'"
