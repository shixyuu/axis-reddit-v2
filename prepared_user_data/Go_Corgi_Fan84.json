        "In response to 'If she truly still believes the crap the AUB preach, it’s no wonder she sobs all the time. The heaven you go to is based on how many wives your hubby had. You need a min 3 wives to get your own celestial kingdom. Kody was doing just fine before he met Robyn. He was on his way to his own little slice of heaven. When Christine left, he still had 3 wives and could still have his own place in the stars. Then Janelle and Meri left.  Now there’s no place in heaven for Robyn - unless she dumps Kody and gets a new hubby, or she finds a few new wives for Kody. We know that’s not going to happen. So knowing she’s lost her entire afterlife is the reason she’s so upset and wants Kody to get on better terms with the ex-wives. She doesn’t want them in her life - she wants their money, and she wants a ticket to a great afterlife.', a user said: 'Based on her interviews she likely still considers Janelle in and despite Christine’s marriage to David since she didn’t get a release by their Church I bet she considers Christine in.'"
