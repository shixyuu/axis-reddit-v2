I'm glad I've never disliked a job enough to hire a band to play me off when I quit, but NGL I would love to üòÅ', a user said: 'I flipped off the coke-head boss, blew his coke all over the break room and then did a burnout across the parking lot one time after he broke the camels back with yet another melt-down. It was one of the most glorious moments of my professional life.'",

I‚Äôve only been to one quick lube joint that wasn‚Äôt trying to sell me crap I don‚Äôt need.', a user said: 'I watched this dude accidentally dump like $200 (20 years ago) in high performance transmission fluid this customer brought in for us to change into his car. Didn't tell the customer about his mistake, put our bulk shit in his high performance car and sent him on his way.'",
        "In response to 'blew the coke right up your nose?\nhim to any higher authority: not only did he quit, he did my rails!', a user said: 'I probably would nowadays lol. Back then I was a pretty straight edge kid just trying to earn a buck and knew it would piss him off to no end.\nI did steal the rolled up dollar bill he was using though!'",
