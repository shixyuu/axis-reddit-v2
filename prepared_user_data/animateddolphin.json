        "In response to 'Original Post: You’ve Heard of Quiet Quitting. Now Companies Are Quiet Cutting Layoffs are down, but employers are still finding ways to cut jobs -  Is this normal or economy tanking? More problems expected in late 2023 or 2024?\nWorkers are waking up to emails and team-meeting requests with a jarring message: They aren’t fired but their jobs are gone.\nPeople on the receiving end of these memos describe running through a range of emotions, from relief that they’re still employed to a sense of dread that their bosses secretly want them to leave.\nhttps://archive.ph/cYXyk\nhttps://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youve-heard-of-quiet-quitting-now-companies-are-quiet-cutting-ba2c326d', a user said: 'I can confirm quiet cutting. My company is a Fortune 200, and conducted a series of layoffs across various divisions throughout the US. Some of the layoffs were specific and overt, others were done in a more low-key fashion. It started with asking division heads to cut low performers. Then, it evolved to cutting entire offices, saying it was “consolidating operations” at the headquarters. Then, it evolved to asking remaining staff to consolidate with other offices that were beyond a reasonable drive time - we’re talking hybrid employees now being asked to drive 5 days a week into an office 1-3 hours away from their homes. It’s a “quiet layoff,” with those employees expected to self-select themselves out of a job that’s  beyond a reasonable drive time.'"
