        "In response to 'On whether Harris should run in 2028: please do not rehabilitate her.\nThe campaign itself was ok, but let's be honest, she was a bad candidate. She got asked on the view whether she would have done anything differently than an 81 year old man with 32% approval, and she couldn't think of a single thing! Why not say Gaza, or that the cost of housing would be more of a priority or something\nHer 2019 primary was also a disaster. And in 49/50 states we lost ground. CA governor? Sure, why not. But please not president, she would lose by even more in 2028. Americans want outsiders, not the ultimate insider.', a user said: 'I liked Kamala Harris in the 2020 primary and kind of gave her a slide on walking away from M4A and the rest of her progressive platform because, dog gone it, she has a lot of charisma and she was great in the Senate during the Trump presidency. But her 2024 run basically repeated all of the problems of the 2020 primary but with much more disastrous results so like... fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. She just does not have the political instincts for President. Both campaigns she surrounded herself with some straight terrible people and both times she let herself get talked into walking away from why people liked her. If you can't even be bothered to fight for your platform during your campaign how can anyone expect you to fight for it as president.'"
