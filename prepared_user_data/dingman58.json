        "In response to 'Please don't take this as a criticism since you've already had your epiphany!\nI've always viewed the guy who never calls out as someone who's either bad at time management or has no hobbies. Not judgmentally, but kind of in an empathetic way. Like, you can't think of anything at all you'd like to get paid to do on your day off? It's PAID!! I love the feeling of waking up on my paid day off and just telling myself I'm getting paid for everything I do.\nWatching star wars in my underwear? Paid. Eating waffles? Paid. Poop in my own toilet? Paid paid paid. I carry absolutely ZERO vacation time and it disturbs the hell out of my coworkers and bosses. I don't care, I'm happy getting paid to do shit other than work. There are so many different ways to get a day, a week, a month+ off in an emergency. USE YOUR TIME OFF PEOPLE. LIVE.', a user said: 'I came across this blunt take on it recently and it really hit home for me:\nALWAYS LEAVE OFFICE ON TIME\nWork is a never-ending process. It can never be completed.\nInterest of a client is important, so is your family.\nIf you fall in your life, neither your boss nor client will offer you a helping hand; your family and friends will.\nLife is not only about work, office and client. There is more to life. You need time to socialize, entertain, relax and exercise. Don't let life be meaningless.\nA person who stays late at the office is not a hardworking person. Instead he/she is a fool who does not know how to manage work within the stipulated time. He/She is a loser who does not have a personal or social life. He/She is inefficient and incompetent in his work.\nYou did not study hard and struggle in life to become a machine.\nIf your boss forces you to work late, he/she may be ineffective and have a meaningless life too; so forward this to him/her.'"
