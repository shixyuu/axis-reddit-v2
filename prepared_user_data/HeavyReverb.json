        "In response to 'I have been working on it for a long time. Months. Been unhappy a long time, and taking steps to eliminate my anxiety and find outlets. This job finally got to the point it was clearly affecting my mental and even physical health. When I brought that up to my manager, he shrugged it off and told me to relax. I don't feel bad at all if I happen to have thrown him under the bus in my final messages to management.', a user said: 'Been there. Sending you lots of courage your way. You  sound like someone excellent to work with. It was definitely a bad environment. You’re raising your standards and not accepting environments that don’t serve your well-being. It was an act of self love. Keep being kind to yourself. Screw what other people think, you have to know how to work hard but you also know when to walk away from things that are not worth it.\nI think I was earning more in my last job but after spending on my health from constantly being sick from the toxic environment, making 10k less because of that. I found a job now that earns me the same but in a good environment.\nI learned to ask the right questions and disqualify work places, at the interview and even afterwards.'"
