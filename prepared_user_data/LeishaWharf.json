        "In response to 'I was a maintenance tech at a nursing home before, I called in a day before because I was in the hospital and fired me but not stating any reason because we are a at-will state.\nBut anyways they denied my unemployment and got it but it took 2 weeks for unemployment to get shit sorted out. It pissed me off they actually tried to deny me.  So I called the department of health and told them every building infraction and cost them a lot to fix.  Friend told me they were fucking pissed at me at the next monthly meeting.', a user said: 'My husband worked a night shift where they locked the workers in. He said if I went into labor he'd have to break a window to get to me. I reported them and an inspector found other violations, too, and fined the crap outta them.'"
