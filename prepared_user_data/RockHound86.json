        "In response to 'Ding ding ding. This is why I had to get out of tech sales after almost a decade. No matter how well you do, no matter how hard you work, some board member somewhere is going to look at your success and decide that means the goals weren't high enough and you made too much commission, so then you spend a few quarters at unreasonable goals and they put you on a PIP cuz you never stood a chance at hitting these numbers to begin with. Then they point to the Silicon Valley sales reps who wake up at 12 pm to respond to the blue birds that flew in their window while they make money hand over foot doing absolutely no day to day work.', a user said: 'I know someone who worked in house (soft) collections for a high end retailer's credit card issuer. They were incredibly good at their job, winning \"Performer of the Year\" in 2008 and runner up in 2007. That company brought in a new division manager in Q2 of 2009 who promptly decided that too many bonuses were being paid out and raised the goals by a ridiculous amount.\nAnd you know how that went. Some of the people saw the writing on the wall and jumped ship. Others--like my friend--made a valiant but misguided effort to rise to the challenge. Within 18 months she went from top performer to a PIP to staring down the barrel of termination. After she and many others left, the whole department was in disarray and ended up restructuring.\nAll because some MBA didn't want to pay out bonuses to hard workers.'"
