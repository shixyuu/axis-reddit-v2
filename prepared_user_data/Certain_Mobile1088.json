The anger and bargaining phases are all over, and you're moving towards acceptance of the relationship and the person as they are. Acceptance doesn't always mean divorce, but it usually should. Because you've just fully grieved the death of the relationship.', a user said: 'I can promise you there was no grief when I left my marriage of 20 years. Anger and disappointment, yes.

I had zero regrets and never looked back.\nWhen the love itself dies, there may be no grief.'"
