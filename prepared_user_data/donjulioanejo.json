There isn't any real point in a job description at that point as it covers anything from washing my boss' car to giving him a foot massage to doing someone else's entire job.', a user said: 'I mean, if my company wants to pay me my dev salary to wash cars, I'd be cool with that.  Nice break from debugging postgres deadlocks all day.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah, not so much. A solid 7 hours in the work day is the expectation for salaried workers—it’s codified in the labor code. Any company that doesn’t pay sufficiently to justify extra obligations outside core business hours is probably going to lose its talented workforce in short order.\nThis isn’t a GenX anachronism — GenX just knows when to draw the line and where, and how to that without fanfare, drama, or whining.', a user said: 'That's precisely the point.  Many companies would pay maybe okay money if a 7 hour chill work day was expected.\nBut instead, you'd be expected to work like your pants were on fire the entire time, and then go home and catch up on work, and be available 24/7 on evenings and weekends.\nThat's the working culture in many, many companies (personally worked in a few of them as well).\nSo, employees had a choice - do the same thing but for way more money, or say \"fuck it\" and work to rule and only do what's written in their work contract.\nBecause the labour market is tight, companies like this lost many of their high performers who jumped in short order to significantly better paying jobs.  So, they were left with \"average\" workers who either weren't the brightest to begin with, or were generally good but just didn't want to do more work than strictly required and cover for company issues (losing huge chunks of their more talented workers) by putting in more hours.\nEnd result - the whole drama about \"quiet quitting.\"'"
