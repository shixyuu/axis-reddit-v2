        "In response to 'Original Post: /u/x_v_b explains how the sudden ubiquity of the buzz-phrase \"quiet quitting\" is really just a PR exercise to discourage workers from standing up against wage theft by employers [External Link]: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/x0feqg/whats_up_with_all_these_articles_about_quiet/im91pkm/?context=3', a user said: 'This doesn't seem like best-of material to me at all. The poster barely \"explained' anything. They made a claim/assertion that this term is a PR move by \"companies\". No details, no sources for anything, nothing anyone can check or follow up on.\nWikipedia and numerous articles claim the term came from a viral Tik Tok, but again don't offer details. Knowyourmeme seems to offer a possible origin in a Tweet, but the way the Tweet is phrased makes me suspect the user had already seen the term - eg possibly on a less-easy-to-document platfrom like Tik Tok:\nhttps://knowyourmeme.com/memes/quiet-quitting\nGoogle Books n-gram viewer and Google Trends has no results for the term before March, so it doesn't seem to be an older term reappropriated recently.\nWithout better sources it seems this term emerged organically on Twitter. I highly doubt that's as the result of some conspiracy by unnamed \"companies\" - way more likely this is something that was invented by, and then resonated with, regular people on Tik Tok.'"
