Their reactions are a direct frustration at themselves for not managing correctly and feeling like they got “played” but quiet quitting is not an OE specific thing. He probably didn’t have another job and just was able to collect “free” paychecks because the company didn’t manage correctly. They have to blame someone so it’s easier to blame the quiet quitter but it’s not OE specific.'"
