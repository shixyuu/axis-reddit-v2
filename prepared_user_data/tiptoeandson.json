        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I think it’s valid, completely. No one should be shamed for not doing more than they’re contracted for, but employers need to understand that those who do go above and beyond are a privilege that they shouldn’t take advantage of. Quiet quitting is a great way of levelling the playing field, showing them what they could have had if they treated their employee better.'"
