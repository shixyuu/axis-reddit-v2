        "In response to 'My abusive ex doubled down and tried to propose 4 months before I finally left him lol. I donâ€™t know on what planet someone realizes their partner is checked out and thinks that a flashy ring will somehow fix the problems that lead to them wanting to leave in the first place. Solid logic.', a user said: 'ooh, my toxic ex did the exact same thing! Went from \"I just don't see a future with you\" (cue my quiet quitting/exit strategizing) to \"I want to marry you and have kids with you!\" in the span of about 1 month. He told me that something was missing in our relationship and then he realized that it was fear of my leaving that was the thing missing??? Like, he needed to be in constant fear of me leaving to be happy? I think our exes are solid logic bros, lol.'"
