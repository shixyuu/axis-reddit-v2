        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I'm loving the \"Quiet Quitting\" trend.  I don't think the name fits because most aren't \"Quitting\" but the act of doing the minimum for what you are getting paid.  For the longest time I've had employers talk about \"putting in the work\" or \"show why you deserve\" blah blah blah.  It's nice to have the script flipped where I can say, \"If you want me to do that I'll need a raise because that's not in my job description or what I was hired for\".\nI have no sympathy for the industries struggling to hire right now.  Hospitality and Education specifically.  They've been mistreating and underpaying for years.  It's their own fault they are in this situation and I'm glad they are screwed.  Time to pay up or shut up.'"
