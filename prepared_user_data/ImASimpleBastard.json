        "In response to 'So your blaming unions for people not being paid more? Lmao what a joke.', a user said: 'No, what he's saying is that we're locked into our collective bargaining agreements for the duration of their term. For instance, my contract was signed at the beginning of 2022, and expires Dec 31 2024. Our raises are baked into a schedule as determined by the contract. Until we renegotiate I always have the option of going to my employer and asking for more money individually, but they also have the power to tell me to get the fuck out of their office. As a collective bargaining unit the employer is much more inclined to play ball with us. Unions aren't going to violate a collective bargaining agreement because when we negotiate we need the employer to know that we're doing so in good faith.'"
