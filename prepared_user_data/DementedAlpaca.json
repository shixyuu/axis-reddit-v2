I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'As a nearly 50 year old, former manager... please let me give you some advice: Keep doing what you're doing. It's a JOB. It's not your life, who you are or what defines you. You do it so you can afford to do the things that ARE you who are, ARE your life and DO define you.\nPlease don't ever fall into the trap of \"work harder, longer and more so you can climb\" It's a job, not a ladder.'",
        "In response to 'Replace \"minimum required\" by required alone and it no longer sounds like employees are underperforming or unprofessional. Doing the required tasks and going home is being professional.', a user said: 'But how do I get them to do MORE than the required amount?\nI don't know Kevin. maybe pay them more, give them better benefits and show actual appreciation for their efforts instead of an annual pizza party with cold pizza from Little Ceasars and a shitty cake from the Walmart Bakery?\nYou know, more than the minimum?'",
        "In response to '“Work isn’t supposed to be fun!” “Ok? It isn’t, so…” “Wait why aren’t you having fun at work??”', a user said: '\"Work isn't suppose to be fun\"\nYeah, well you don't pay me enough to like being miserable so I'm going to have fun while I'm here goddamnit.'"
