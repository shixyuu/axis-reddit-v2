        "In response to 'The work contract cannot waive it, you have to sign something very specific to waive it, and while you may be coerced to, you should not be and should never be disciplined for not doing so.\nThat's the law (I think, I haven't read it in years)... Reality says you're right though, lots of jobs expect you to ignore it as a matter of course. I was handed the slip to waive it on my first day and told to just sign it.', a user said: 'This guy knows! It’s unlawful to include a Working Time Regulations opt-out clause in the body of an employment contract. It must be a separate and specific opt out offered voluntarily by the employer. Thus, the “any hours so required” clause usually found in most contracts cannot permit an employer to make staff work in excess of the protections found in the WTR.\nThat is, until, this Government seems determined to bonfire workers’ rights legislation and place even more unreasonable restrictions on trade unions being able to take action.'"
