        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'It all comes down to making yourself seem too busy and too important to the company to take on the smaller tasks. Often what i find useful is saying i can do this in the next month. They will say thats too long. In that case i need these two tasks taken off me.\nIf the timeline is achievable but barely allow room for bau tasks, intentionally don't do them and just say you were too busy with xyz. This makes them think you were effectively prioritising your tasks. Win win'"
