        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting is happening at my school You all have heard it around the world. Quiet quitting or \"simply doing your job and nothing else\" is going around. Anyway the Fall Fling dance rolls around and teachers are \"required\" to chaperone. Basically we are given a google form to sign up for a shift to chaperone the dance. No this isnt paid, yes its on a Friday night after a long work day and week, and no food is not provided to teachers. Total suckfest all around. Well get this, the day before the dance we get a frantic email from Admin. No one signed up to chaperone. NOT A SINGLE teacher signed up to chaperone. We get some messages about how this is mandatory, teachers must be there for the event, we can choose which shift we work but must be there. No one signs up. Cue Admin start walking door to door with a sheet asking people to sign up. Get this, the teachers stand their ground and say no. Of course a few caved, 1 or 2, but overwhelmingly the teachers say no.\n​\nGuess what happened, well they had the dance, the admin chaperoned, the few people that signed up, basically a skeleton crew. The next week nothing, no messages, no angry faculty meeting, nothing. They know that they cant do anything to the teachers because its not one or two, its everyone. Listen I understand that kids need fun stuff to do, but maybe don't make teachers do it, or if they have to be there pay them??', a user said: 'In the past I have suggested to our student council moderator that it would go along way if the student council (who plans the dances) would use a little of their budget to give teachers that chaperones gift card… just something to show that they appreciate that folks give up their Friday. Found out recently that our very democratic student council moderator left the decision up to the kids last year and those little shits said “no, we aren’t going to spend our money on gift cards for the teachers”. I know they are kids but what the fuck. And yes admin should compensate us for the loss of a weekend night. Ridiculous that they expect this of teachers in the first place.'"
