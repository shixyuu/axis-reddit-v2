[External Link]: /r/AskReddit/comments/xwwzxk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_quiet_quitting_acting/', a user said: 'Quiet quitting sounds like come corporate bullshit to make workers feel ashamed of not giving life and limb for a damn company.\nActing your wage is something a lotta people could use. Don't get me wrong if you work in a cutthroat industry where you need to put out 110% to chase the bag, go for it but when you're working at mcd's for minimum wage you're better off saving your energy for some courses or even a trade school. As long as your workshare is done, you're not lazy for not doing more than you're paid for.'"
