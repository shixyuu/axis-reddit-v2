        "In response to 'Original Post: Companies Decide to Keep Four-Day Workweek After Finding It's Better | So-called \"quiet quitting\" could decrease if companies move to a four-day workweek, an ongoing UK study finds. [External Link]: https://gizmodo.com/four-day-workweek-remote-work-tech-jobs-1850139680', a user said: 'It doesn't matter what the employees think or what would be best for them. All the brass want to know is the bottom line.  If five day weeks look like it's better for profits then that's what's going to happen.  Making it worse:  the people hired to find out about these things spend most of their time and effort finding out what the C suites want to hear.  And that's what they will deliver so they can get their big bonuses.'"
