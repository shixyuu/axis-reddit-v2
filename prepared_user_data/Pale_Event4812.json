        "In response to 'Original Post: The Flipside of \"quiet quitting\" is quiet paying. Don't forget this. Somebody older I know asked me why young people are \"quiet quitting\" their jobs and not trying to work hard. I told them that quiet quitting is a bullshit term that describes doing what was outlined in your contract, and not more. He started to tell me how you need to hustle and do more than the minimum if you want to succeed. I told him that the difference compared to many years ago is that now hard work is not met with commensurate rewards or opportunities. Then I asked him the following question:\nIf it is culturally acceptable to push people to go above and beyond what is outlined in their contract, why does the company always only pays what was agreed upon? Why doesn't payroll ever go above and beyond what was agreed? Shouldn't it also be culturally acceptable to expect extra salary in this case? Aren't my company quiet paying me?\nHe had nothing to say and just looked uncomfortable. He didn't really agree but he has no good answer either.', a user said: 'THIS!!! I have been in a company for nearly 8 years. I did a lot of extra work on top of my assigned job. BEFORE COVID, I asked about a raise after I had another glowing performance evaluation recognizing all the extra I do for the department. I was told to go to HR about it, who then told me that \"We don't pay for performance\" I was told I agreed to a set amount and I am on a set pay track. I was told if I wanted more I needed to find other opportunities. So I stopped doing all the extras and did only what was required and what others on my \"pay track\" were doing. Why put in extra effort to help a company succeed that does not recognize those efforts? Since COVID, we have been overwhelmed with work and very understaffed. I pick up extra shifts to \"help out\" but only when they offer extra money for it that is more than overtime. Now I'm following the HR reps advice and looking for another job......outside of the company.'"
