        "In response to 'The \"work ethic\" that didn't really exist? My observations living in Japan have been that there are two types of \"Japanese work ethic.\" One is the master craftsman who dedicates their life to their trade in pursuit of perfection, sometimes to a toxic level which more or less abandons their family responsibilities. The other is appearing to be busy without accomplishing anything, as is typical in the corporate world, which isn't really a work ethic at all.', a user said: 'I worked at a Japanese company for a year, and most of the time I only saw people pretending to work. Once, I saw a Japanese guy making a ceiling plan in PowerPoint with simple squares one by one. When I asked him why he wasnâ€™t using the CAD software, he just shrugged and kept working in PowerPoint. That's how productive they really are.'",
        "In response to 'At least he was not doing it in Excel...', a user said: 'Joke's on you, once I received a layout plan for a storage building in excel from the Japanese client. He even went to some lengths to download a top-down image of a forklift and paste it into the \"drawing\", just to make it look a bit more realistic.'"
