        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'If I bust my ass and do far more than my share, I don't see another cent, and I don't get noticed for promotion. I don't get any benefit at all. So, I do what I must to not get hassled.\nWithin most organizations I've worked in, busting your ass does not get you promoted, because why would they promote someone who is doing exceptionally in their current position. I have a degree, a wealth of knowledge and experience, and competence far surpassing most of the bosses I've had. Yet I cannot get promoted, even when going far beyond my job duties.\nThe job culture is overworked, underpaid, underappreciated, and exploited, all the while dealing with oppressive and depressing work environments. For far less than a living wage, to benefit a very small minority.\nI work full-time and attend school full-time using my GI Bill to get a housing stipend. I still am sinking slowly into a mire of debt as cost of living skyrockets and wages stay stagnant. So yeah, I do the bare minimum now.'"
