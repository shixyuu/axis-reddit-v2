You do have to stand out once in a while to move ahead sometimes, but you gotta be strategic about it'",
        "In response to 'People who work hard and efficiently are punished with more work than they are paid for. No thanks. I signed up for specifically what I wanted', a user said: 'I think it depends on the field\nI strategically choose situations when to go above and beyond especially if it makes an impression and with the plan to reference it for raise discussions. When I do I make it clear that in that moment I went above and beyond but not to expect it as norm, with the assumption being a raise or promotion will motivate me to show them that part more\nMy bosses have always complemented my firmness and strict work life balance. It’s the same boundary setting that makes me successful with our clients\nNot many people know how to stand up for themselves, and worse, many jobs punish those that do'"
