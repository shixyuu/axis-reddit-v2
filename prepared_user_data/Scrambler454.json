        "In response to 'Can we stop calling doing the job you are paid to do \"Quiet Quitting\"?  That is just marketing capitalists are doing to make it out to be something bad.\nYou are just doing exactly what they are paying you to do.', a user said: 'Exactly. The concept of doing only what you were hired and are paid to do has been around for decades, if not longer. There have been and always will be people in an organization that choose to do the bare minimum of what is expected of them, and then you will have those who choose to go above and beyond, excel, and seek leadership positions in an organization. Our parents did it, our grandparents did it, our great-grandparents did it, and so on; it is nothing new. Folks nowadays just want to give it a fancy label \"Quiet Quitting\" and a trendy catch phrase \"Acting your wage\"'"
