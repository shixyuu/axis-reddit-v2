        "In response to 'And the other side of the coin is employers paying the minimum amount contracted to keep them from quitting.\nIm not sure what your point is here. Companies will offer different rates for the same job for several reasons: they want to attract more candidates, they want to attract better qualified candidates, and they want to retain current talent/reduce turnover.\nYes, employers dont want you to quit. Retraining costs a lot, and it's cheaper to just give you more money. Idk what this matters. We as employees also choose jobs based on their wage all the time. I quickly quit my 18/hr job to make 30 elsewhere doing the same thing. Employers compete with each other in the labor market, and you are the commodity.\nSo minimum in the sense they wont pay me double my worth? Yes. Minimum as in that they will pay me scraps? Not if they care about any of the things i mentioned', a user said: 'The point is pretty clear, most employers are doing the equivalent of quiet quitting on their side. If they expect employees to go above and beyond the bare minimum, they should do the same for their employees.'"
