        "In response to 'Have you noticed all the Quiet Firing going on, where employers only pay the minimum required by contract or employment agreement and no more?  I can't remember the last time an employer went above and beyond on payday.  It's like they don't even care.', a user said: 'To me the very idea of even having a minimum wage is a slap in the face to all employees all over the world. What it translates to is if they could pay you less they would! \nMinimum wage means the employers only deserve minimum effort.'",
        "In response to 'I’m happy to go above and beyond for managers willing to do the same for me, but I’ve wasted enough years toiling under people who wanted to squeeze me dry while insisting they couldn’t afford to pay me better. If the boss makes it clear there’s no reward for working hard, then I’m just working hard enough to not get fired.', a user said: 'Minimum wage deserves only minimum effort. Nothing more. \nFair is Fair.'"
