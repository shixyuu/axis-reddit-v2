I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'What jobs do you have that you can do this? I work from home for the last 6 years and I'm busy all day.... i could work all the hours a day if I didn't tell myself it's ok, I did my 8-10 hours depending,  I've clocked out, and the task will be there tomorrow for me to do'"
