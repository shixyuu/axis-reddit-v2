        "In response to 'If I found out one of my team members was protesting something by taking a lunch break, my first question would be, \"You weren't going to lunch?\"\nDo people think being a good employee means not taking vacation?\nI've been in the workforce for three decades. I'm interested in finding out when vacations, lunch breaks, and not working after leaving work became bad things.', a user said: 'As a manager in middle management, I often have to tell my employees to go home at the end of the day or not to cancel the vacation that they had planned for a work thing that came up. My perspective is that:\n1) I cannot guarantee that my bosses will recognize/appreciate/reward them for working extra, so I have a responsibility to manage their expectations and prevent disappointment.\n2) I recognize that my direct reports are less productive if they are burnt out, so it is in both their own best interests as well as the company's if they take care of themselves.'"
