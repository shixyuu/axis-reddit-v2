Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'I work hard and have fast rates because it makes the time go by faster. I don’t give a shit about Amazon as a company. I do also take into consideration what this product is and what it means to the person who ordered it (Cpap masks, cat food, pads) and that motivates me. But I get the gist and you can blame the president for that inflation that makes you not motivated'",

I just watch videos and pack. All the while on my days off searching frantically for another job.', a user said: 'Well I love my job at Amazon and we can’t wear earbuds so I do it all in complete silence.
