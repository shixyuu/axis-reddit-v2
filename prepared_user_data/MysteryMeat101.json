        "In response to 'Yup. This happened to me. They promise our entire department new roles with the additional duties included. 9 months later I was doing the additional work without the additional pay and quit quietly.\nI should quit loadly but my situation prevents that.', a user said: 'Similar situation where I work.  Production was up when everyone was working from home.  Then the company laid off about 10%  and everyone that was left was asked to pitch in and make sure everything got done.  The company cited their poor financial status and didn't give merit raises or bonuses.  After the layoffs and no raises, more people found other opportunities where they don't have to do more work for the same pay so their work was redistributed to those who were left.  I took on someone else's responsibility both times but had to negotiate to get paid OT while I did that.  How stupid is it that they gave me a whole other person's job and expected me to do it for the same $?  I just want my life back so I stopped working any OT and get up and leave when my 8 hours is over and I work at about 50% efficiency.  If things don't get done, maybe they'll hire someone.  It's not my problem anymore and that has never been my attitude before.\nI'm also in a situation where I have limited opportunities elsewhere.'"
