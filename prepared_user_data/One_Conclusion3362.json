        "In response to 'That's great. But it def applies to most ppl.\nIt's only the last 4 years that I joined a great company and I should be grateful. Just tougher because of housing costs too. I make 3x the average LA salary but my housing is 3x times what it was back maybe 10 years.\nI'm definitely my choice to live in an expensive area. It just tough to see how callous some people who grew up here, inherited their house think it's down to hard-work when they would never be able to afford their area anymore.', a user said: 'Meh, a lot of people from every background do not share the same sense of the grind. Some people have significantly lower levels of motivation and are headstrong in their social beliefs in what is owed to them.\nYou see some people in this very thread complaining about minimum wage compensation. Do we really think those very same people are, as an example, over a third of their way through their working age or careers? Or maybe the lower skilled labor is what they are a part of and care most about increasing.\nNo one ever really mentions career jobs and complains about the wages. Many of those people already are aware that hard work pays off. And they've learned that it isn't always monetarily compensated hard work (e.g. looking for a job is a full time job when you don't have the job you want, or starting lower level to start is worth it in the long run).\nE: I just read a comment that stated the quality of work you do has nothing to do with whether or not you get promoted. Like, what world are these people living in? Do they not network and socialize in that world? I just don't get some people's personal entitlement'"
