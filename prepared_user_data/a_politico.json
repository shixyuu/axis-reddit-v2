        "In response to 'I thought the same thing for a long time until I really started thinking about it. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say I've actually really come around on preferring the switching back and forth because you really do get the best of both worlds with an admitted tradeoff a couple times a year (but really like once a year, I'll never complain about an extra hour in a day).\nThis is one of those issues where I feel like most people probably do think that just picking one would be nicer, but then if we were to do that it would actually kinda make at least one month worse than what we're used to, particularly if you live in the northern half of the country.\nNot that I'll die on this hill but I'm tired of hiding in the shadows haha', a user said: 'I’m with you. I used to be stridently pro permanent DST but then started realizing how late that would make the sunrise in northern and western parts of each time zone in the winter. And I’ve kind of come around to the shift being the best of a bunch of non-ideal options.'"
