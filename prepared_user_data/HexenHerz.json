        "In response to 'As a recent grad who started a career this year, I'm so confused by \"quiet quitting\" and why anyone would be upset at it. I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'Its a Boomer thing. Back in their day, going above and beyond got you somewhere. It no longer does. Nepotism and the \"buddy system\" are about the only ways to get ahead. Ironically, the same boomers complaining about \"quiet quitting\" and \"no one wants to work\" are usually the same ones that created the conditions that generated those things. Also the same ones that stagnated pay, cut benefits, eliminated pensions, all to enrich themselves.'"
