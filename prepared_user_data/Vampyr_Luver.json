Your list of \"good job, now this has to be done\nevery time\n...\" just gets bigger.\nNo one cared or realized how much work you actually did in your position, our team was actually one of the fastest amongst similar stores at what we did but management still complained that \"we should just be faster\" whenever a minor problem cropped up or pointed out that task x took too long, we wouldn't be able to do it.\nManagement would train you to do certain tasks\nof theirs\nso you could do them, for no extra pay, if you let them. And even then pay rates for the promotions themselves were also shite, not really worth it compared to a job hop.\nIt really is an important skill, to be able to read the room. Learn where you're actually valued, and where you're not. In the former, then pick up some extra tasks and make yourself irreplaceable. In the latter, act your wage and do nothing extra because you'll never, ever be compensated for it.', a user said: 'As I get older, I'm starting to think that's the secret to life: read the room.\nDoes management care? If not, don't worry about it. If so, make sure to deal with it\nDoes your professor/teacher actually want to see their students succeed? If so, then make a point to take their class next year. If not, avoid them come course selection time\nDo the cops actually care if I make this driving maneuver? If not, go ahead. If so, don't do it\nI feel like so much unnecessary stress can be brought on by worrying about things no one cares about'"
