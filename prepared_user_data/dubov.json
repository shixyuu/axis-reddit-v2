I'm putting off needed house maintenance cause some projects local contractors have literally doubled their prices since Covid. I can't afford that, and I can't do the work myself because I'm working. I am saving but BARELY. Definitely not remotely close to what id need for the retirement that will never happen. I think about people I knew in the 90s who were my age now, making significantly less than myself and everything was walking on sunshine.

Who is booking them and where are getting all this money from?'"
