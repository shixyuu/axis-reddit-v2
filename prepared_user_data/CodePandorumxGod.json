        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: '\"Quiet Quitting\" is such a dumb fucking name.\nNo, people are not quitting their jobs. They are still working. They just aren't taking on the excessive responsibilities or extra work some companies try and force onto them, and are instead strictly following what duties are laid out for their employment.\nThese people aren't \"quitting\" their jobs. They're simply refusing to take on work loads they can't handle, and that's completely normal and acceptable. Anyone who thinks otherwise is either A) a workaholic, or B) a corporate douchebag.'"
