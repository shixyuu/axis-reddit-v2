        "In response to 'Quiet quitting was coined by corporate to make it sound bad and put employees who do it in a bad light.\nSimply put, it means doing exactly what you agreed to and what you are paid for.\nThis is not quitting by any dictionary I am familiar with. This is plain and simple doing your job.\nCorporate 'culture' has it you have to work more than you agreed to, more than your contracted hours, more than you are paid for, to impress the employer, to \"show you care\" and other bullshit like that. People are gradually waking up to the realisation that this is all unacceptable.\nIf we flip this on its head, why doesn't the company pay me more than we agreed? Or why doesn't it cut an hour or two off my day's shift? I'm sure any corporate linguist could find a variety of reasons to respond to that, and those are the exact reasons why the employee should not work past their hours and pay.\nSo no. 'Quiet quitting' doesn't exist, purely because it has nothing to do with quitting.', a user said: 'I swear when the term 'quiet quitting' first popped up it was about groups of people who would show up to work, clock in, and do nothing as a form of strike. Get enough people doing this en masse and you hit the company with a double whammy, shutting down production and forcing them to pay wages.\nLike a week later it was being used to describe people who don't bend over backwards for their job. I swear I'm not crazy.'"
