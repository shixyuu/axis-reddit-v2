        "In response to 'Eeeugh bragging about the hours is one that was chronic when I was a chef. You’re not a real chef unless you’re working 16 hour days for 2 weeks without a day off apparently. The only person they’re mugging off is themselves.\nThe trouble is companies know a lot of chefs have this old school mentality and exploit it, putting them on salaries and making their situation impossible unless they pull stupid hours.\nThe last place I was a head chef at before I quit, my contract was 45 hours. So that’s what I worked one week just to make a point. I came into work on Monday and left packed up for a long weekend off at the end of service on a Wednesday leaving them without a chef for 4 days till I came back on Monday. Weirdly, immediately after that he hired 3 more cooks.\nFortunately I got out of it just last month after years of mental anguish which at one point put me in hospital lol.', a user said: 'It can also get worse as time goes on. Say a business requires X number of tasks done in a year. The team do it well.\nThe next year X is increased. The teams struggle a bit, but it's completed just in the nick of time.\nThe next year X is increased again. The teams start working longer, skipping breaks, but for whatever reason at no point to do they push back, they almost become martyrs, being proud that they've worked to exhaustion, looking down at peers who took their lunches and so on. With the additional hours they've worked they just about manage it.\nThe business doesn't necessarily know about this struggle, all they see is that the target was met again. Guess what happens the next year?'"
