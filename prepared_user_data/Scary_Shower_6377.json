        "In response to '\"Quiet Quit\" is such a bullshit term. I do my job for the agreed upon time.', a user said: 'At first I didn't think the term made sense until I have been backfilling someone else's position for over 8 months on top of my normal job. It has been good for experience but I'm literally doing the work of 2 people. They say they appreciate my work and will make it up to me once the company has the budget. That won't be for another year most likely. I've slowly stopped going above and beyond for the extra job for the past month and no one said much but just asked if I needed help üòÇ or if I was too busy with my main role that I was hired to do. I told them yes, but they admitted that they still don't have the budget to backfill the position üíÄ Which the person I'm backfilling for was getting paid over $100k and I make under $70k.\nAlso, I originally accepted my main position as it was 1-2 days a week in office expectation only AND you got to pick what days work best for you AND we could leave early. Now it's required RTO Tuesday-Thursday. My commute is an hour plus long. I realized that I have essentially been \"giving\" almost an extra day of work if you count my commute back and forth. üò≠ I have a second round interview for a fully remote position later this week ‚úåÔ∏è'"
