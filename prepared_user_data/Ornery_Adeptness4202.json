You can pile extra tasks on me all you want, but if I don't have time, they're not getting done. Overtime isn't that worth it to me.', a user said: 'This is exactly it. Every time I go above and beyond I’m shooting myself in the foot. I get the same raise as my coworker that constantly calls off, does shit work, and as someone that had to manage employees-is just all around bad at their job. I climbed the ladder in my 20s a bit, but the raises were pathetic and the stress and added work weren’t worth it. I’m going to ride out the back half of my career doing the bare minimum.'"
