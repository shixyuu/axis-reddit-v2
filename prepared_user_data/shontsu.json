Its a fancy term for \"doing what you're paid for\" to make it sound like you're not doing what you're paid for.\nI don't think everyone should do it, but I do think everyone has the right to do it. If you want to get ahead or a promotion or a bigger than average wage, then you probably should be doing more, but if you're happy doing your job at the wage you're being paid, just do your job.\nAlso, if you realise that if doing more doesn't actually get you those things above with your current employer, just do you job and look for a new one.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: How is performing your job duties “quiet quitting?” Are you penalized for your efficiency & preventing burnout? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/02qwb6ziqvi91.jpg', a user said: 'First article I read about \"quiet quitting\" used the term \"only doing the minimum required for their job\".\nWhich...means they're doing whats required for their job.  Like wtf.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah, that doesn't sound like what I would think of quiet quitting as.  To me quiet quitting would be doing absolutely nothing, and waiting to see how long it takes until you get fired.', a user said: 'Yeah, which is the point.\nThey've deliberately coined a term for one thing, that makes people automatically think of something else.'"
