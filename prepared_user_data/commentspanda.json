        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I ended up real quitting but two of my colleagues have remained in the job. It’s a small team and they both quite quit. It’s been months and it seems nobody noticed….occasionally I think I should have stayed and kept getting paid for doing very little haha. It was miserable work though.'"
