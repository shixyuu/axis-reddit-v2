        "In response to 'I assume it has that name because people only start doing it once they don't care if they get fired but honestly I've been doing it since my adulthood. The majority of management have their heads so up their asses that they don't recognize individual efforts, let alone everyday for 8h straight. It doesn't deserve our time and energy, no matter the field of work. The company will still carry on and people fail to see it', a user said: 'I get to sleep 2h on a job daily, no fucks given. Will I get fired? Doubtful as I am gettin my tasks done. I am even getting above average score on my reviews. It's like I have lowered their expectations to the level where I can work at most for 6 hours and still be praised.'"
