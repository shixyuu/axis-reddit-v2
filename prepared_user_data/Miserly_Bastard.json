        "In response to 'Most of the reduction came from highly educated men working intensive jobs more than 50 hours a week.\nI believe there is a generational shift happening culturally because men, especially in this cohort are likely to have partners that also work. With child rearing responsibilitiea being more equitably shared in the younger generations, something has to give.\nAnecdotally, I see that single, childless men have the most availability work extra hours and they are rewarded for doing so. Also, DEI initiatives disincentive companies from promoting men, so why should they put in extra time in those environments if they're going to be passed over.', a user said: 'It's not just child rearing.  It's also that GenXers and Millennials have elderly parents that had fewer kids than their parents did.  The burden of elder care can't be shared between siblings or extended family.\nThe younger and middle-aged membership of social institutions like churches have also been hollowed out, which traditionally could provide support for people going through a household crisis as well as help with childcare and elder care, either through formal programs or networking.'"
