        "In response to 'All this uproar around “quiet quitting” is a distraction. “Workers performing only their required job duties and no more.” Exactly. If you want me to do more, pay me more—I’m not “quietly quitting”, I’m doing what you paid me to do. Maybe employees need to pay people more if they want them to perform more? I know, it’s a new idea—maybe even RAdiCaL!!! But hell!\nIt’s all just noise stirred up to distract workers from continuing to fight for what they are actually worth. Nobody should be profiting astronomically off the backs of their workers yet that has been happening forever and even more so in the last 40 years.', a user said: 'Ronald Reagan wants a word with you\n/s'"
