        "In response to 'Original Post: Reddit was so hot on \"quiet quitting\" but now when you talk about using slowdowns to interfere with the fascist takeover, all you hear is crickets We are at a pivotal moment, where either we choose to plunge the system into darkness on our terms temporarily, or the oligarchs drive the system into darkness on their terms for the foreseeable future.  And yet, so many people seem willing to just continue, business as usual, even as our protections (worker protections, immigrant protections, social services) evaporate before our eyes.\nThe ruling class may own the companies, but the working class still runs them, and we have a chance to use that to help ward off the darkness.', a user said: 'Can I just ask this? Who here wants governmental waste??? Nothing I’ve seen so far being cut is anything anyone should want taxpayer funding used for. If you want to subsidize worldwide news corporations then send them money from your paycheck….\nI do t like everything Trump is doing, he’s Trump, he’s going to be an ass. But I’m all here for DOGE. Every cut I see makes me both happy and sad. These people in DC are BLEEDING US DRY. And both sides use our paychecks to subsidize all their buddies. This is a good thing and I’ll stand by that til I die.'"
