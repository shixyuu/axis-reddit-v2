Do your job.\nRoughnecks on drilling rigs are in danger all the time.\nHell framers on a construction site are in danger all the time.\nDeal with it or get a different job.', a user said: 'Oddly, being a cop is a relatively safe job.

Honestly I don't think we need a massive punishment - from the videos it seems like most of them are teens who will probably age out of it soon enough. There are probably a few ringleaders who would be most worth trying to shut down, but I doubt it needs a massive crackdown to stop the problem.', a user said: 'Why can't we finally use asset forfeiture for good for once instead of just shaking down innocent people for money?'"
