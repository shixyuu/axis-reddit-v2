Manager new what was happening and fled to a new team.\nWas assigned to a new team a couple of months ago. Have not had any work assigned in almost a month. I log on.

More problems expected in late 2023 or 2024?\nWorkers are waking up to emails and team-meeting requests with a jarring message: They aren’t fired but their jobs are gone.\nPeople on the receiving end of these memos describe running through a range of emotions, from relief that they’re still employed to a sense of dread that their bosses secretly want them to leave.\nhttps://archive.ph/cYXyk\nhttps://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youve-heard-of-quiet-quitting-now-companies-are-quiet-cutting-ba2c326d', a user said: 'That quiet firing reduces their exposure for unemployment claims, as (former) employees dont fully understand their right to file for unemployment when they have been been Constructively Dismissed.'"
