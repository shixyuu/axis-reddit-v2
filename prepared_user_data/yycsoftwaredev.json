        "In response to 'Classic Canadian fuck-up story in the same Hall of Shame of Nortel, Blackberry, etc. etc. Our managerial class are overcompensated cretins.', a user said: 'Canadians don't want to win. We are satisfied not to lose.\nThe problem is at that level, it isn't sufficient to not lose as cultures where people want to win will beat you.\nThis isn't Canada bashing. I am very much someone who lives life trying to avoid losing.\nYou see this in the personal finance attitudes of the nations. Americans want to be rich, with no real limit to their ambitions. Canadians want to not be so poor as to be a renter in a condo.'",

        "In response to 'Lol\nworries they can't rely on employees\nWhen could any of us rely on companies.  I got laid off bombardier the same year they received millions from canada.  All ceo's can get fucked.', a user said: 'Every company that my friends were with March-May had layoffs. Every last one. Mine too.\nAll are now back to hiring.\nYou can't even rely on your org to keep you through a period of panic.'"
