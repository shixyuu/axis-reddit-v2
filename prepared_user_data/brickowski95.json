        "In response to 'What truly terrifies me about this generation is that they are the next workforce and they just... don't want to do anything. Like they are all so anti school and haven't realized that life is work, honey.', a user said: 'I have students who have jobs. I think they take it a little more seriously because they are getting money from it. I have no idea if they are good workers, but I am guessing they can do the basics of what the job requires. It’s usually something in the service industry/fast food. I have also had a few students quit because they definitely can’t cut it.\nThey DO use it as an excuse to get out of doing work in class, like they claim they worked late the night before and are tired. So, that gets old. I tell them they need to remember school is their number one priority right now, but that usually doesn’t matter to them.'"
