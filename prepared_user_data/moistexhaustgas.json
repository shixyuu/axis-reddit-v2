        "In response to 'Reagan has been out of office for some 35 years now.\nAlso, remember the Savings & Loan crisis? Banks were taken over in receivership by federal regulators, thousands of executives were prosecuted, hundreds jailed - under George H.W. Bush (R), Reagan’s former VP.\nWe have had decades worth of Democratic Presidents and blue states with total control of lawmaking and executive functions. Did corporate raiding get tamed or inequality get better? Have you looked into Bill Clinton’s legislative pushes like welfare reform? Ot Joe Biden’s work on bankruptcy laws that made it harder for families an$ students to discharge loans in bankruptcy- so bad that Elizabeth Warren hated him before being bought off to endorse him? Who do you think bankrolls Democrat politicians? Elite corporate and tech billionaires.\nYou are just being a partisan hack repeating the same old attack memes from the 1980s. Blaming dead people gets us nowhere except you thinking you’re preaching to the choir, while the current bad actors watch people like you with glee. Were you even alive or cognizant of politial issues when Reagan or Clinton was President?', a user said: 'I highly recommend to anybody looking at this thread to check out the book “Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America” by Kurt Anderson. It addresses this rebuttal on Regan’s role in our current situation. It is extremely important to acknowledge the Regan years as one of the catalysts leading to our current economics. They had a cascading effect which led to some of our worst problems today. He was certainly not the one solely responsible, though. Even the Wikipedia summary of the book can give some good insight.\nOne interesting topic the books documents is how after the Regan years, every president had to start leaning more and more economically right in order to get elected (particularly the Dems, i.e. Bill Clinton onward).'"
