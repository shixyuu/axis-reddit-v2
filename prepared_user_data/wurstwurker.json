        "In response to 'Basically we are at the point that a single income family making 100k a year but bought pre covid and locked in a 2.5% mortgage is in a better position than a dual income family post covid and 7% rate.\nThe point of dual income was to have a huge buffer and easily save.', a user said: '170k combined in Michigan.\nIn the Metro Detroit area the only houses below 350k are absolute dogshit in shit areas.\nEvery house in the 350-400k range right now were at minimum 100k less 4 years ago.\nIt's outrageous.\nThere's also a severe lack of homes between 300 and 350. They basically don't exist...\nWe're not broke.\nThe issue is our situation will look like this:\n3k/mo if not closer to 3500/mo in mortgage, then 1875/mo to 401k, and everything else to typical bills. thats basically our entire budget. Let's say we go with a 250k house somewhere. That's only 1k/mo saved. Now maybe we can have a child.\nIt's outrageous. I make 105k/year! That wage would have existed 4 years ago. The issue is salaries haven't adjusted.\nWe should be living great. Instead we're going to be forced into living like my single father dad did making like 50k. It is fucking absurd.'"
