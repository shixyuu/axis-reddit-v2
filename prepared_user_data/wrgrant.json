Labour is not valued equal to what it produces, the entire core of Capitalism is that those in charge get more value from the workers they employ than the workers get paid for. We have just seen this situation erroded to the point where workers don't feel they need to do anything extra unless paid and not abused by the employer. Employers have gotten used to the situation where they can treat people unfairly and as entirely disposable.\nUsing the term \"Quiet Quitting\" is just playing into their hands though. Its not quitting in any sense, thats utter BS, its simply doing what you are being paid to do\nand nothing more beyond that\n. Framing it as a negative thing is pushing the Corporate side of the dialogue. We need a different term and different media coverage of it, because the solution to this and the \"workers don't want to work\" (another Corporate Propaganda viewpoint) is simple: Treat employees fairly, and pay them well. Hire enough people to cover the actual workload. Keep employees even when things slow down so that you can keep their experience handy for when they pick up again. Stop treating employees like so much dogshit. Companies will no doubt make less profits but they will make more consistent profits in the long run and supersede their competitors who don't treat their employees well.'",

Just because Joe needs a raise, and he is good at his current position, doesn’t mean he would make a good manager. A shitty manager will cost the company far more in the long run.', a user said: 'The Peter Principle: People rise to the level of their incompetence, i.e. you get promoted based on what you do well until you get promoted to a job you cannot do well.'"
