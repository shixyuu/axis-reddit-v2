        "In response to 'Yall forget learning good hard work ethic is something you cant just turn the fuck off. Thats why alot of old people run circles around the youth. Its like a traumatized inherited skill exploited to hell.', a user said: 'Facts.  I have some 70 to 80-year-old female coworkers who literally never stop moving. It's probably why they're still moving the way that they do at their age.  Nothing will make you more salty as a middle aged person than feeling like you're dying but working as hard as you can because your body is broken just from aging and years of working and looking over at a 20 something year old kid goofing off and taking it easy.. ðŸ¤£\nI worked in a delivery station for a couple of months and it was my biggest pet peeve. Lack of accountability and watching people my age work until they were sore and sweating while all the 20-year-olds were spending their time flirting or on their phones.   I mean cool but, salty still.'"
