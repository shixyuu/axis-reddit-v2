        "In response to 'I'm GenX. We were taught by our boomer and silent generation parents and early employers to go \"above and beyond\" for our employers and to eat all kinds of shit and abuse to be a \"good employee\".\nWe were taught that we were being 'given a job'. Statements like \"we picked you over many others...\" were said so that we'd feel grateful for the opportunity.\nIt's all one-sided bullshit that poisoned us. It was 1930s Depression Era thinking that had people beholden to their employers and strip employees of their actual worth.\nMore and more, young people today (Millennials and GenZ) are standing up for their worth, and employers are angry about it. I'm proud of these generations for refusing to accept the bullshit the rest of us were sold.\nIt isn't \"quiet quitting\". The only thing they're \"quitting\" is being party to their own exploitation, and there's nothing \"quiet\" about it.', a user said: 'Truth. I started coasting or work to rule a few years ago when my reward for achieving objectives was higher and higher objectives'",
        "In response to 'So basically doing the job you are paid to do, for the hours in your contract, is now somehow bad?', a user said: 'Once had a boss say “nobody expects you to only work the hours in your contract”  I left that place very quickly.'"
