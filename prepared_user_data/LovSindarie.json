        "In response to 'I hate the term \"quiet quitting\". It's not quiting in any way, shape or form. \"Quiet Quitting\" is abiding by the contract me as the employee and you as the employer have entered.  When a company hires a person they (as I view it) enter a business contract, a business deal,  more so than a hiring contract. The contract means I the employee have agreed upon providing a service to the employer in exchange for monetary gain (salary or hourly wage) plus what ever benefits we have agreed upon. In the contract is the scope of my job duties, what is expected of me. Anything expected of me beyond the scope stated in the contract is obviously outside the contract and renegotiation would have to,.should, needs to take place.  So  not going above and beyond is not quitting it's doing my job and doing smart business and not being hustled.\nFor instance if company A had company B  produce a good for a certain price and all of sudden company A demanded that company B  add a bunch of bells and whistles to the product being produced and company A clearly states they will not pay extra for  the new features company B is going to tell company A to kick rocks. Why? Because it's not what was stated in the contract.\nIt should be no different for employees. I am hired, this is the scope of the job, anything beyond that would be as we call it in my job extra billings.', a user said: 'I saw a post about how the phrase is more than likely a PR move. A way to shame employees about not doing more than their job. I 100% agree it is a smear campaign against the working class. We need to not talk about it. Reframe this phrase if possible. But we won’t get there with posts getting thousands of likes unfortunately. So avoiding it and saying it’s a made up term might be the better road.'"
