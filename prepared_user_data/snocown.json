        "In response to 'Original Post: what's up with quiet quitting? I've heard this term \"quiet quitting\" over the last year, indicating that people doing their jobs are somehow not doing enough. If the minimum requirement isn't enough, shouldn't the minimum be reset?  I feel like I'm misunderstanding the meaning of this term.\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/what-is-quiet-quitting-6743910', a user said: 'Answer: money is a physical representation of energy expressed over a given amount of time.\nHumanity is finally learning about this interaction and are starting to take their relationship with money to the next level.\nThe powers that be are being dramatic about it, but the truth of the matter is that the humans are merely gaining their sovereignty back.'"
