Then Covid happened and that really has me loose faith in the clientele plus at the time the higher ups were pushing for “more profits, make more of an effort” during Covid. I think a part of me is just worn out so I started just going by the motto “minimum wage, minimum effort” do what you’re paid to do, do the best to your personal standard and obviously don’t be an arsehole to those you work with and get out when you’re done.'"
