        "In response to 'Don't do the extra work', a user said: 'When I was in my early twenties and believed that hard work was rewarded, I ran the entire logistics department after the manager left suddenly and permanently for a medical issue.     I waited 6 YEARS for recognition and promotion, just to have a less experienced male coworker promoted over me (after I trained him, obviously!). No one should do what I did without a promise in writing for a huge pay increase and title change.'",
        "In response to 'Sorry to hear that. Does sound like my early 20s as well. Got so good at a job I couldn't move to what I wanted to do.', a user said: 'Thankfully I doubled my pay, benefits and got the promotion…. At a larger company that wasn’t “like a family.”  It’s funny because they always said my customer skills weren’t good enough (I don’t like to lie) and now I’m the only customer facing person in my department because the large customers I deal with appreciate that I am straightforward.'"
