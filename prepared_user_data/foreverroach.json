        "In response to '“No reason provided.”\nThis question is a trap to get you to admit to something disqualifying for UI purposes (school, medical, etc). Nobody is going to dig any deeper than absolutely necessary, so when the person processing the UI claim sees that, he or she will just check a box and move on. If you put something like “I was quiet quitting” or “my mental health was suffering” this can create additional headache.\nThe actual truth is irrelevant at this point. The only thing that matters is what is documented. You were fired for no reason, you are ready and available for work now. Money please!', a user said: 'This is the way.\nI was fired, likely for questioning the new management's decisions that were hurting our team, and they gave BS reasons they generically made up (like performance even though we were at top performance and won 3rd party awards and shit lol)\nI said no reason provided on the application and explained to the EDD agent who called me the same thing. He asked if I was ever given any written warnings or anything and I told him the truth, I wasn't lol I also shared the facts about the awards and my performance, including high performance ratings from other, lower level managers who did like me.\nA key piece of info the guy gave me was that most employers don't even answer their calls so it's likely to go uncontested. And yes, I got my unemployment approved.'"
