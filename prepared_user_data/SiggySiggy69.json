        "In response to 'Original Post: What to do if my counterpart has \"quiet quit\"? One of my coworkers has been quiet quitting for a long time. But we're basically in a workplace where people are unfireable (government job). His boss does not seem to want to confront him about slacking, so instead, she gives his work to me and makes everything about \"we\" and \"us\" instead of \"him\".\nInstead of telling him directly, for example, \"hey PERSON X, why aren't you responding to my e-mails?\" She'll e-mail both of us and say \"Hey Team, why aren't you guys responding to my e-mails?\" (When it's very obviously him, not me.)\nWhen he decides not to do his work, she just gives his work to me.\nHonestly, I don't care if he quiet quits -- that's his business. But when his refusal to do work is falling on my table, that's where I start to see things getting problematic. How would you deal with this situation? Telling on him is not a good option, we are equals in the workplace and he considers me a friend.\nEDIT: Wow, so many responses! Yes perhaps my use of \"quiet quitting\" wasn't the right choice of words. My coworker came into my office on Friday and told me he doesn't \"give a f***\" about this job but he feels powerful because he feels \"unfireable\". He spends the entire day working on his own stuff (he has a few side jobs that he does). Our boss seems to be intimidated by him and takes the easy way out - instead of giving work to someone who's going to push back, she'll dump it on others instead. Firing someone is an extremely complicated and long process here, and probably not something she wants to go through. The boss is in her third trimester of pregnancy and getting ready to go on maternity leave. My coworker and I have similar job descriptions so it's easy to give his work to me. Addressing the \"friend\" issue: yeah, I don't really know if \"friend\" was the right word here either. But we're equals and I guess you could say \"friendly\" to each other. Coworker brings me baked goods sometimes, has invited me to get-togethers, things like that. Situation really sucks.', a user said: 'I'm in a similar field. You need to ask for a sit down with your supervisor. I'd open the conversation up with the fact that over the last 30 days you've received  X-# of emails in regards to your departments performance and want to know what you need to do better. Allow the supervisor to respond, if they respond with \"Well it's not you its (counterpart)\" then ask explain that you fell its unfair that you are pulling your weight then receiving emails like that as it makes you feel that your work isn't valued and it damages your morale. If she comes back with \"well you guys are a team\" then explain that  you feel that's not the case, explain all the tasks you've taken off his plate and have a log of how you spend your hours at work starting from when you arrive until you leave for the day (with specific times) so that you can rebuttal anything they try to say against you. Unfortunately most jobs like this have those lazy types all over and unfortunately they don't get ran out as quickly as they should, but I promise the supervisor is keeping tabs.\nIf your supervisor is good, then they'll explain that you aren't the problem. Then you just explain that it isn't fair that you're being called out with him while covering for his shortcomings and that you are being negatively impacted. Just be straight up, the supervisor may not understand that by trying to play the \"Cool\" or \"Nice\" or \"Understanding\" supervisor they're reinforcing bad behavior in your counterpart and disincentivizing  your hard work and efforts.\nQuick Note: Don't be surprised if there's something you don't know about going on. Sometimes it could be something major happened in your counterparts life that they don't want to share with you, but they've shared it with the supervisor so they're getting a little bit of extra grace currently.'"
