        "In response to '\"Centers\" or \"stations\" (assuming they're the same thing?) has always struck me as one of those things they talk about in grad school that simply doesn't translate to the real world.  I don't know, maybe suburban and rural schools have physically larger classrooms, but my room barely has enough space for the students/desks in their normal configurations.  I just have trouble envisioning how something like this could physically work.\nEven something like pulling a group for re-teaching (something which I'd love to do)... where?  Any time I've tried doing that it's this massive logistical hassle of having people switch seats and getting confused.', a user said: 'Just as an idea if you’re strapped for space, I have one student grab a station basket and then that student’s whole table group does their station there at their desks. Each day the baskets are rotated to other groups. I color code some things so they’re differentiated. It’s helpful for when you are strapped for space and movement isn’t possible.'"
