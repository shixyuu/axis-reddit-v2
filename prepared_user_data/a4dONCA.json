It is truly something from a science fiction book that cars are so easily financed these days\nI was bringing home $172 per week after taxes, 1 bedroom apartments were $500 and up, if I looked 10+ miles from work, I had to live with roommates and not have a bedroom and paid $75 per week.\nAfter 6 years in the steel industry, I eventually worked my way up to $12.25 per hour, by then the cost for the same 1 bedroom apartment had doubled, so still had to rent from others.\nI got by because I only had to feed & clothe myself, but seriously, if you think Gen-X earned livable wages, you are seriously deluding yourself.', a user said: 'Agreed'",

No, that’s not it'"
