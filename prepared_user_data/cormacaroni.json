        "In response to 'Idk how this would translate across various industries….\nWall Street isn’t going to give up 20% of its trading hours, doctors and dentists aren’t going to not open 3 days a week, and shops, restaurants, and grocery stores all need to be open daily.\nThis just boils down to like marketing firms and tech companies… unless something I’ve missed….? Article doesn’t break down any of this, and just randomly pivots to quiet quitting?\n61 companies self-selected to do this “trial”, but the results are far from conclusive as far as I can tell…', a user said: 'Wall Street has the tech and staff to trade 24/7, has had it for decades….but they don’t, because rich people don’t want to trade at 3am, generally. You’d be amazed at how market activity drops around Xmas, New Year’s, the dog days of summer…you could open each market one day a week and the trading would adjust to it (and markets would probably be more stable, as they wouldn’t react to every blip in the news cycle). Shops, restaurants, grocery stores don’t need to be open all the time if even customers with a full-time job have 3 days a week to go there. They can do split shifts, rotating shifts, whatever. If stores can sell the same amount of shit in 5 days a week vs 7, the cost incentives all favor opening fewer days.'"
