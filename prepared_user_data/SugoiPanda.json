Worked at a place once where my friend had been there for 3 years, not once did he get promoted and his manager even locked him out of the system so he couldn't apply to different positions in the store. He could apply to other stores, just not the one he worked at. Worked hard as fuck, and could easily put a team of 3 to shame by himself. Hell at one point the store manager had to stop reading out customer reviews cause he got way more than any other employee. All the while, never got a raise, never got respect from the manager and direct supervisor, just never got anything from it. Well nothing other than worse health (both mental and physical). The manager who never got our equipment fixed, never shown us any respect, outright screwed countless employees on pto (long story short he denied all requests instead of actually going through them and then went on 6 week paternity leave) and just overall was not fit for management, got promoted to a different store.'"
