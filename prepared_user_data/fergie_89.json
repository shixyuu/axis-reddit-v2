        "In response to 'NTA.  The boss, as the kids called it, FAFO'd.\nVenting is typically a positive and necessary thing, as long as it's handled appropriately, and it sounds as if you were that appropriate \"bottleneck\" and sounding board.  He was extremely stupid to have not allowed you to explain the situation to him.\nStand your ground.  Just keep it light, sweet, and \"My work load is preventing me from keeping up with those extra tasks\" about it all.', a user said: 'Agreed. This is on the manager.\nVenting is healthy - when handled professionally. I mean my friends would love to meet my colleagues because DRAMA but I also work remotely so we have a call every few weeks.\nWork vents are part of the parcel, we get stressed, we get angry, we cry and we laugh. Hell I had a call today from someone to rant about their Mrs spending his entire bonus on a handbag, I told him I was jealous because I wanted to do that but had to be an adult and pay solicitor fees. (I am the only female senior in my team and one of very few in my company as it's a male dominated field so I am seen as the safe space to rant)\nI stopped emailing my team about 5 months ago when the last other female senior left. I organised a leaving present for her and asked my team for a donation as it was via Amazon (remote working). She was so happy she got her gift so I didn't mind but then realised I probably earn Â£5-10k less than these guys and I footed the bill, only one donated. So I stopped. No birthday cards, no Christmas etc. they did comment on it but then I thought, well no one sent me anything for my birthday...\nOP, Stand your ground. This isn't your responsibility to pick up.'"
