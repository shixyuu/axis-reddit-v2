        "In response to 'This \"quiet quitting\" thing has such a weird name. It's literally \"Doing your job.\"\nYou don't pay the price of a 97' hyundai and expect the performance of a F1. If you want you car to run at that speed, well... it will certainly cost you.\nI really hate how this corporate hustle culture eventually became a scam to have workers give their 100% while giving them a 20% salary. What was the point of that in the first place? Why did we allow ourselves to be used like that? I remember people shitting on the french for being on strike all the time, supposedly being \"lazy\" and demanding their rights. Guess what? They are correct and we were the suckers.\nPaying X and getting X\n10\ndoes not apply anywhere else in the market, (certainly not profesional services) why are employees any different?', a user said: 'Grew up being told take what work you can get and earn your way up by being dedicated, a hard worker, loyal etc...\nThen it turned into having to jump ship every 2-3 years or fall behind. Then it turns out people didn't need to go to school most of the time because they still ended up not making what they deserved and are riddled with debt for life. Then the fuckin pandemic hit and business started gouging every possible avenue to ensure their survival while taking massive instantly forgiven PPP loans and taking record profits.\nIt's not only rigged to survive failures, but it often benefits so much from them that they're going to have to start engineering systemic economic failures as part of a fucking business model. Because guess what, every time shit catches on fire only common folk are getting burnt.'"
