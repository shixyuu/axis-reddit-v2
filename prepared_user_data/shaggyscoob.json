        "In response to 'I had a manager make me mop the ceiling as a way of\nteaching\nme how to keep busy. Some shit is too much for my pride, that ended up being a summer job.', a user said: 'I had a boss whose sole job was to be my boss. I did all the work and he'd saunter by every once in a while to check on me.  One day I took sick and asked to go home early. Later when review time came he gave me a lower grade on dependability because I went home sick that one time.\nMy half day off didn't even inconvenience him. He didn't fill the gap. He just closed up shop and I found all my work undone and patiently waiting for my return.'"
