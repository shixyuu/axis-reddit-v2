I used to go above and beyond all the time at my job. Stayed late. Came in early. Did extra projects. Learn how to do do more to do more. My yearly raise was 1% for 2 years in a row. Said screw it and did this “quiet quitting”. The next year I received a 5% raise. Guess that’s what the company wanted.'"
