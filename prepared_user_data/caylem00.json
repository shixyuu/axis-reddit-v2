        "In response to 'Good luck.  I was recently not chosen for a promotion for acjob that i had be doing for a year and a half.  They wanted to finally have an official position.   Gave it to another guy who had worke a lot with the hiring manager.  Its all bs.  However, it sounds like he does not have time to breath, so i probably dodged a bullet.  The extra 15k woukd have been nice.  But still may not be worth it.', a user said: '15k sounds nice until you balance it against the extra medical costs and new unhealthy coping mechanisms due to the stress of your new workload. And they'll weaponise that promotion against the guy who got it anytime he falls out of line or dares to want a better work/life balance or has a family emergency. If not his direct manager, then some higher corpofuckwit who only sees staff and shareholder quarterly metrics.\nTook me decades to learn that, after a certain amount (needs met comfortably), money only reliably buys convenience, not happiness. The costs of getting more and more aren't necessarily monetary, nor are they written on the metaphoric pricetag. In the end, the Musks level rich types of the world can't buy their kids first steps they missed, or another second with a passed on loved one.'"
