        "In response to 'this is how i operate at work. i make just enough to keep my head barely above water, with essentially no capacity to save money at all.\n\"the only reason i'm here is because of the pay, the company has negotiated with me and with the union to make that pay as low as it can get it, and so the result is my income is barely adequate. in return,\nso is my work.\n\"', a user said: 'Man, they have really done a number on us. They are all in it together. Give us enough to eat but also as little as they can so that we can't afford to stand up for ourselves. I support the railroad but my union don't. I support the barristas and the Amazon workers. My union don't. They say nice things but we won't act on them. We need someone to unite us all. Our own Fuckin Trump! Other wise just get back to work and be happy you have a job. This is bullshit'"
