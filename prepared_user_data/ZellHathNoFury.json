In the US the only higher cause of bankruptcy is medical debt (another ridiculous system designed to drown the poor). They also take a huge chunk of the middle class and ruin their future; forcing them and the next generation into poverty.\nAll credit cards are ran by scum, itâ€™s a purposely evil system.', a user said: 'Medical debt drowns the middle class, pushing them into \"poor.\" The actual poor qualify for free healthcare. Conservatives want to be the royalty that controls the poor, so they attempt to bankrupt anyone in the middle anyway they can in order to collect more poor people to control.'"
