        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'I'd like to add in that pressing employees this way has been leading to higher turnover.  Steady staffing is ideal, but constantly pushing employees to do more than 100% of their daily expectation when your team isn't likely to compensate leads to a halo of problems.  People expect some type of compensation for their effort, and it's an additional slap in the face when you see employees putting in less effort but receive the same reward.  It's a dead-end job, just let the person who is consistent be consistent.  They will stay on and the work will be consistent.  Let the person who is working hard and wants to stand out do so.'"
