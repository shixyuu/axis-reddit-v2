Well he doesn't get the bang anymore but 3/4 aint bad.\nYou realize your life is centered around him and his comfort right?\nYou realize keeping up appearances teaches your kids that his behavior is acceptable and normal for romantic partners right?\nWhy wouldn't your sons treat their partners differently, after all mom was happy to be supermom and do it all!\nWhy would your daughters expect their partners to treat them better than their dad treats you, you're happy as super mom they should be too!\nYou realize that youre passing on the generational curses your living through right?', a user said: 'He has everything the way he wants it.\nAnd btw, if you have kids, the sons will model after dad in their relationships.  And the daughters will think itâ€™s normal to be with someone like Dad\nWaiting till they are adults to show them a change is too late.\nBeen there.'"
