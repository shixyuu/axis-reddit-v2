        "In response to 'Original Post: What happened with quiet quitting? I'm definitively going to start quiet quitting this next month. I'm not proud to work at my current company (quite the opposite) and my boss thinks he's paying to make me his slave.\nBut I was looking for tips on how to start quiet quitting here on Reddit and I could only find old posts. It seems like it's not a thing anymore. Is quiet quitting dead? What have I missed?', a user said: 'It’s really not that deep, and your strategy for doing it should be tailored to your job and personality.\nFor me it just means not volunteering for things that don’t serve to benefit me (taking notes at every meeting for the team, serving on little workplace committees that don’t pertain to my work, etc), signing off promptly at 5, taking my unpaid lunch break every day (or taking the time off somewhere else) and taking 100% of my PTO and personal days without guilt.\nI get my work done and I do it well. I’m helpful and considerate with my team and offer to pitch in when I can and when it makes sense. I don’t volunteer to help teammates who make a habit of doing shitty work or waiting until the last minute. I don’t “bring my whole self” to work. My company isn’t entitled to me beyond the function I serve and the work I complete. My coworkers aren’t my friends. I try to minimize how often I think about work during my personal time.\nThey simply do not compensate me enough to take over my life, and the work I do isn’t meaningful to the wider world. It is a job that I do because I need health insurance and a wage, and I treat it accordingly.'",
        "In response to 'Do you feel like this could stunt your chances of moving up?  Does it bother you to see others go over beyond and get recognized / rewarded?  Asking because I have spent years pushing and doing more only to realize that I was going nowhere. lol 😝- now trying to decide if I do less or if I keep trying (but different tactic).', a user said: 'I think I’ve mostly given up on the idea that I’ll “move up” in whatever role I’m in. Over the course of my career I’ve seen so few examples of individual contributors being promoted to new roles with better pay and a cooler title to accompany more responsibilities. The only way I’ve seen people move up was to switch jobs. Grinding at my current job to try to get promoted doesn’t make much sense to me. It makes more sense to do the required work while the job market is hot trash and wait for things to improve so I can try for something better.'"
