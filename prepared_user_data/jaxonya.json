That family shit goes out the door when you're being escorted out lolol', a user said: 'I'm all for gen zers doing whatever they wanna do, but they've got little terms for everything as if they invented it. Softquitting just means ur doing ur job and not giving a fuck. \"Looksmaxxing\" y'all didn't invent \"trying to achieve maximum attractiveness\" that's just called putting in effort. \"Softmaxxing\" y'all didn't invent using moisturizers and skincare\" \"hardmaxxing\" y'all definitely didn't invent using steroids and working out. Y'all can have ur cute little social media terms, but it's kind of obnoxious. \"Sigma\" .. y'all didn't invent trendsetters\nSigned, millennial'",
        "In response to 'Gawd I WISH I had 6 people left when they did this to me. It was a team of 8-10 and then it became a team of manager and me... then just me. Then day shift got MORE people and still somehow did LESS work so I was stuck doing overtime all the time every day. No pay increase though. However they DID take the time to tell me no more breaks allowed because of all of the shit to do.', a user said: 'Should've been a nurse. They can't fire us, and they are always trying to hire more people. As many hours as you wanna work. I worked 90 hours a week for 2weeks straight just to see what it would do to my bank account. It was awesome.  (Nurses also typically enjoy what they do, with little oversight or anybody telling you what to do) .. I basically just go to work and leave anytime after my shift. I could probably work 20 hours straight without anybody noticing or giving a shit. Wanna go to Hawaii for 2 months and make double what you make at your home facility? Go for it. Throw a dart at the us map and go there? Do it. Make double'"
