        "In response to 'Quiet quitters are now often leaning away from the \"hustle culture,\" which puts work at the center of life, and instead are shifting to the idea of boundaries and a life outside of work. Quiet quitters can also be employees who are choosing to set better boundaries at their job by not working over the weekend or late nights to get something done or answering messages outside of business hours, FOX Business reported.\nSo, Minnesota is in the top 5 states with common sense?  I'm not doing \"bare minimum\", but they pay me for 40 hours, they get 40 hours.  The rest is mine.\n\"Quiet quitters\" sounds like a term made up by upper management to try and shame people into doing work for free', a user said: '\"Quiet quitting\" makes it seem like the worker actually left the company - like someone who doesn't put in an official resignation notice or tell anyone they're leaving, just stops showing up.\n\"Quiet quitters\" how they're using it in the article is how we define our \"steady Eddie's\" in my workplace - they don't show any interest or initiative to move up the ladder, but that's totally fine, because they're content with their daily work and always get the job done. The company would actually be in shambles without people like this.'"
