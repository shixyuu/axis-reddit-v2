        "In response to 'work ethic? you mean the ability to be exploited?', a user said: 'I worked in Korea, where there's a similar outward image of \"hard work\" that companies try and project.\nIt's bullshit.\nIt was always bullshit.\nEveryone knows it's bullshit, but culturally everyone has to project the appearance of being a \"hardworking, dedicated employee\", when in reality they're mostly goofing off, gossiping, shopping online, etc...\nYes, people might be \"at their job\" for 12 hours a day but they're absolutely not doing any more work than someone in the UK or Germany who's at their job for 8 hours.\nThat's also why a lot of companies are moving away from that culture too. People are just tired of keeping up the facade.'"
