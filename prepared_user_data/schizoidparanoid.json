Left a horrible job, didn't rage quit, but rage told my boss I'm done, it can be today, or 2 weeks, whatever don't care your choice but Im letting you know this was the last straw.  Worked 2 weeks, it was all management. Checked up on the old guy there and asked how it was going, he said much better, asshole plant manager fired the whole front office, only the plant manager and second asshole in charge left, so their so busy hiring new assholes my department is on easy street.  Other than the 6 person department is down to 2 and trying to hire 4 more.  SO, SO, SO glad I left.', a user said: 'You might wanna change your username then lol. Username does not check out.\nGlad you got out of a shitty work environment though. More specifically, that you got away from your shitty, abusive boss.'",
        "In response to 'You sound like a developer, where do you live and what's your speciality? My company is almost always hiring and my team in particular is looking for a few new devs.', a user said: 'I just want to stop and tell you that you are a very kind person for sincerely offering a potential job (or, at the very least, a job lead) to OP after reading their story. Helping complete strangers out of the goodness of your heart, expecting nothing in return, and not caring if a single other person sees/knows what you did to help - that is the sole metric of a truly good, kind person. Thank you for being one of the good ones in such an unfathomably shitty world.'"
