However where do you think your wages come from, sky daddie?\nIt’s super annoying and at the end of the day I never did like it but at the same time those people spending their money is how you are paid and that person isn’t technically doing anything wrong. If a restaurant says it’s open till 12 that means food can and will be served right up until 12. This won’t happen every single day but it will happen. Some people get outta work late and just want a meal when they get home. Others maybe were late getting there, you never really know.\nBeing mad you hate your job and taking it out on someone that has nothing to do with your job or your life chooses in general other than buying something and your the one picked to deliver it isn’t the way to go about this.', a user said: 'This is a real Karen take… it costs nothing to be kind and I’m sorry but the one douche that shows up at 8:59pm isn’t keeping the lights on with that order lol. So yeah, cooks and servers are allowed to have feelings about it.'"
