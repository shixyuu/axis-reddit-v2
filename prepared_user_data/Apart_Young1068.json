        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'I always call before giving up on anybody. I usually call first before texting because it's easier and more sensible to do while behind the wheel. it's common sense that if there's a problem, you CALL, You don't sit around texting and waiting for a solution smh. Alcohol deliveries are my favorite orders to accept. Y'all can have fun in the Chipotle line for 20 minutes during rush hour. I'll be in and out with a bottle that's waiting on the counter every time.'"
