        "In response to 'Yeah although I kinda get it, like there's a big difference between coming in with enthusiasm, exceeding targets, covering shifts, staying behind to get that bit of work done etc, to just coming in and doing the bare minimum', a user said: 'It's not necessarily the bare minimum, though. I'd say that has negative connotations, like you aren't putting in any effort. I'm always trying to do every aspect of my job as well as I can, but I'm not doing unpaid overtime, and I'm not taking on extra projects unless I believe they'll improve my own employability. I'm not going the extra mile for a job that pays me so little and offers so little progression, because I'd rather use that time to work on my mental health and I'm clearly not going to get enough in return from them to make it worthwhile, but that doesn't mean I'll do a bad or even mediocre job while I'm here.'",
        "In response to 'Because I do 10-20% more than my hours state.\nBy doing that, I’ve gotten promotions to get 4x my original salary very quickly.\nThis path is much easier if others do the bare minimum!', a user said: 'At my current workplace, the next step in the ladder will get me a £900 payrise. The one after that would be a £500 payrise. The one after that is under £2000. I can get promoted three times (after having already been promoted) and still not reach a 30k salary.\nIt's all very well if you have realistic progression opportunities, but utterly worthless if you don't.'"
