        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'Literally in the exact same boat. I sell electronics and I have 280K sales pending from June 2021 that I haven't been paid on. Like a total of $3 million in pending orders I haven't received my commission on yet and our average order is about $20K. People cancelling every day, I feel like all I do anymore is babysit these pending orders and never even get a chance to sell.'"
