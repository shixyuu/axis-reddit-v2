        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Friend of mine from grad school always spent 18 hours a day on her work projects for Accenture. Her boss didn’t seem to favor her over the other employees. She let herself work till 2 AM, 7 days a week. She worked while on vacation, also past midnight according to her insta stories. She worked on national holidays. She worked while meeting friends for lunch. She always showed up to zoom meetings early and was the last to leave.\nShe was adamant to climb the ranks of her consulting ladder. Which she never did because she was fired after 11 months of working with them. I don’t know what she’s doing now but she’s disappeared from social media. Last I saw, she ended up in the hospital over severe sleep deprivation issues. And probably others as well.\nI honestly would rather be unemployed and living with my parents than be a consulting slave. This is probably only one example and I hope it addresses  why quiet quitting shouldn’t have to exist in the first place.'"
