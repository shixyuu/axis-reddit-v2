        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'What really grates me is when direct colleagues decide to freely waste their time doing extra work. So now I look like a cunt because my colleague has stayed behind half an hour for no reason, or another slightly less direct colleague has whipped up 74 spreadsheets in an hour at 4am or something\nDickheads'"
