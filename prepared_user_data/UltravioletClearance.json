My company only offers 10 days of pto a year (That's sick and \"vacation\" combined). Can't take time off without risking getting fired due to not having PTO for an emergency (no unpaid time off allowed). No WFH and no flexibility at all, strict 9-6 office hours and a 1.5 hour commute on top of it all.\nAs the pandemic lifted in early 2022 I realized not having a vacation since 2019 sucks and basically stopped doing anything but the bare minimum.  Just signed a job offer fully remote unlimited PTO and a $20k pay raise.'"
