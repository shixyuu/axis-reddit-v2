        "In response to 'I did until the week prior  puppy pickup because I expressed the amount of work that goes into puppies , he had went shopping with me with the list of puppy supplies and made a few suggestions and even seemed very excited. The day after I had already saved a bunch of resources on puppy training, psychology, etc to help us get on the same page.l for consistency . I offered them to him since he's never had a dog before, I had had many dogs  but mostly duties were shared with my siblings and I as kids and I definitely needed a non-farm dog in the south refresher. He declined and said he'd figure it out. As they say in the memes \"It was then that I knew I had fucked up\".', a user said: 'Many moons ago I had a hubby that used Weaponized Incompetence, (which is absolutely a form of emotional and psychological abuse!)\nYou see, it would have been so much less effort to do the potty break yourself…you wouldn’t have had to show him the OBVIOUS labeling on the dog treat, or get up the second time to take over the responsibility…\nSadly OP, PLAIN AS DAY you are being abused.'"
