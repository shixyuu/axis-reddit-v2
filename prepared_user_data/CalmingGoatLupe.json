I don't want to leave ever. Yes, I might be able to make more, but not with the same perks.', a user said: 'I worked for a place that actively worked to keep employees happy so that we wouldn't ever consider a union. It was such a treat and in my 37 years of working, the only place that gave a flying f*ck about us.'",

So big corporations are doing their best to paint employees in the worst possible light, and getting the feds to up migration such that they keep an upper hand. Fuck these storylines: “Quite quitting, rage applying, labour crisis”.\nWhere are the stories about the quality of life absolutely plummeting in this country over the last two decades?', a user said: 'Where are the stories angry about employers not hiring? I've put out 100s of resumes and never even had so much as a confirmation of receipt or a thank you but the position has been filled...and the same positions and same wages are advertised time and time again.'"
