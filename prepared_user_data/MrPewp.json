Spike strips could kill or seriously injure them so they cant do that, and blocking a bike in is dang near impossible', a user said: 'Why not have police bust their meetups before they take off? They announce and plan these things weeks in advance, I've even seen Instagram posts advertising the next meetup already. If I can find them, it shouldn't be difficult for police to find them - it's unrealistic to expect to arrest them all, but a few arrests every event would be a small deterrent for the crowd.'",
        "In response to 'Until they actually commit crimes, the first amendment protects their right to assemble. Can't preempt them.', a user said: 'Correct me if I'm wrong, but haven't many of these guys already committed crimes in the past times these rides have happened? There's reports of damaged vehicles, groups of people stomping on civilians, threats of physical violence - I think we probably have enough camera footage that we can link some of these people to these crimes.\nWe have extremely invasive cameras that can identify people based on things like their unique walking gait already, and if the government is going to use them against us, can't we at least use them for something good ðŸ˜­'"
