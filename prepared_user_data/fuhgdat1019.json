Kept telling myself it was just a part-time gig (technically full time).  But I started taking a full hour lunch (usually running home and tackling a quick chore).  Then I also spent plenty of time reading, watching you tube, etc.  I had to be there full time but only actually working about 30 hours a week.'"
