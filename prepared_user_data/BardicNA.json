        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'My reward was the highest raise of all of my coworkers. It was 3% and didn't keep pace with inflation. I told my boss in my review that my raise was 3% but inflation for the previous year was 3.7% so I'm effectively making less. He told me in kind words and corporate speak that I should be happy to have gotten anything what with layoffs a couple months ago. I left for another job.\nI wish this story had a happy ending but my new job has slowed down to the point we only work 9 days a month. My old boss got ahold of me asking if I was looking for work and I told him the days and hours I'd happily do. He came back saying HR would only approve a temp to hire position through a temp agency.\nI guess my point is that winning the rat race only gets you the least spoiled piece of cheese. I've managed to avoid a couple layoffs and got a hefty raise that doesn't even match inflation. I'm somehow the lucky one. When we decide to eat them I'm going for the drumsticks.'"
