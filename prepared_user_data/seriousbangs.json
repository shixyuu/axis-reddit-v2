Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'They're just lazy. When they were young you didn't really do as much work during the day. There wasn't nearly as much pressure to produce because the economy was so much better in their day. So they don't understand that today when you're on you're on. There is no \"water cooler talk\".'",

I thought \"quite quitting\" was just what we old folks used to call quitting without notice.\nThis is much, much worse. This is why newspapers are basically dead and TV news ratings continue to drop. Why the hell would I pay somebody to tell me shit like this?\nSeriously, fuck our media for pushing this on us. There is no way anyone who works for a living came up with this idea. It was made up by some millionaire carrying water for some billionaire.\nI think I just threw up in my mouth a bit.'"
