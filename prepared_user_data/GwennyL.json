        "In response to 'Original Post: My icing quiet quit ðŸ˜‚ I made some Xmas cookies and took them to moms. I made far too many and brought the rest home. They all survived except the trees. The icing came off in a sheet. Did my icing job just quiet quit? The other cookies are fine. Only the trees did this. All decorated the same day using the same batch of icing. Weird!', a user said: 'This would be ideal for my 4yo who will scrape off the icing with her teeth then hand me the cookie when she is done.  Cool, thanks, kid.'"
