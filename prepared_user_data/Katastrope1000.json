        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'Don’t punish the person that got the job they didn’t make the decision, and you don’t know yet what their experience was and truly may have been the better candidate.  With that said you should as for an interim pay bump for taking on the additional duties to be back paid and continued until they are officially handed off after training time.  In addition let them know you would like to know what the new role is and if the budget for it has been approved since they are working at a deficit (assuming since people were let go)'"
