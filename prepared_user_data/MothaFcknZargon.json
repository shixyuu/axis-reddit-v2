But executives don't know what to do about it\".\nMaybe just compensate the employees for the record profits they're helping to achieve? You don't even have to be a crazy altruist executive, even just split 50% of the extra profits amongst the work force of thousands, while you keep the other 50% for like 5 people.\nThat'll do a hell of a lot towards incentivizing your employees.\nEspecially if every other company is still hoarding the full 100% like fricking hob goblins.', a user said: 'bUt WhAt AbOuT tHe ShArEhOlDeRs?????'"
