        "In response to 'Wage compression:\nWhen companies offer higher starting salaries to attract new talent without adjusting the pay of current employees\nBasically, the minimum wage jumped in my state, and now they need to offer higher pay to attract new employees, but they didn't adjust the scale for existing workers. I started at this job making $12/hr, which was $3 over minimum wage at the time, and now, after 9 years, I'm making $19/hr - which looks good on paper, except the state minimum wage is now $16/hr, so I'm still making $3 over minimum wage.\nThe worst part is that I'm expected to train kids walking in the door, making as much or more than me, who were in middle school when I started here.', a user said: 'I've quit jobs because of this. Hey Mr. Manager, I hear the new hires are making $x. Can I get a raise? No. OK, here's my notice, have a nice day.'",
        "In response to 'Why just the youngest employees?', a user said: 'Because the majority of young employees are seen as hungry and naive and will potentially try to out compete others by working harder, longer, fast without compensation. While older workers have been through the grind and realized how futile that is in the end. You dont make more money as a worker by working harder. You make more money by job hopping or getting into management or getting into a heavily specialized field.'"
