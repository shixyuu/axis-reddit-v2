        "In response to 'Original Post: [The Philippine Star] \"Quiet quitting\" is taking over the workplace – what exactly does it mean? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'I think quiet quitting is such a terrible term, when you do everything that’s required of you in a job you should be done for the day. Walang “oh, can you do this and that?”\nSa baba ng sahod ngayon, why go above and beyond? Worst case scenario pa is 1) low salary 2) no appreciation 3) you’re doing a lot of things out of your job description.'"
