        "In response to 'What does “the itis” refer to here? I’ve used that term in healthcare, but to refer to hypochondriacs that come to the ER every other day for random (read: normal) pains.', a user said: 'It's a phrase I only know thanks to The Boondocks, and it refers to the N***** Itis, which I absolutely didn't know at the time as the full phrase, but I think that was the shows intent. Its a phrase from the days of slavery in the US, used to describe why your slaves were \"slow and lazy,\" that persisted into Jim Crow, and most general racism.\nIt has applications across all of history and even today, why work hard when you'll never rise above your stature or class? A question ancient peasants were smart enough to ask. Do just enough to get by, no more. The recent propaganda of the American Dream is just that, and meant to benefit a select few.'"
