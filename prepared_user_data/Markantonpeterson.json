        "In response to 'Gets your peers annoyed at you because they donâ€™t like it when someone comes around that shows management that this job can be done in a shorter amount of time', a user said: 'As someone who gets off on efficiency though this is so sad to me. Not in a managerial sense, I could give a fuck about some corporations profit. But in food service I loved the feeling of having a great team that you just effortlessly vibe with in the kitchen, and kicking ass with them through a huge rush. There's a sense of comradery and it's just nice. I want a job where I can work hard without being taken advantage of by management or despised by my coworkers. That's fucking toxic and sad in my opinion. And to be clear it's not the workers in this situation that are responsible for the toxicity. It's managers who are hyper focused on short term gains as always. Which leads to them shooting themselves and their employees in the foot in the long run.'"
