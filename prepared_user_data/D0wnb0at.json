Which I think basically is quiet quitting. Doing the bare minimum not to get noticed/sacked while still getting full pay.

I work 9-5, but often dont actually do any work till 12-1pm. I have a target to hit and I can do that in a few hours. Its not \"quiet quitting\", its just doing the job im paid for, well, and in less hours than they allow me. If I was bad at my job, then id need to work 7.5 hours to get it done.'",
