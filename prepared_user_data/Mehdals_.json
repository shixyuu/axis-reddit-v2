It's just a way for companies to vilify workers for only doing what they are asked to.\nActing your wage is much better.', a user said: 'I prefer Quiet Firing... Get a minimum raise, get pushed to do other departments work, expect to work overtime and not take breaks, not getting required resources to actually do the job.... slowly getting pushed out the door.'",
        "In response to 'Doing their job duties ONLY within their work hours.', a user said: 'More like getting Quiet Fired... Get a minimum raise, get pushed to do other departments work, expect to work overtime and not take breaks, not getting required resources to actually do the job.... slowly getting pushed out the door.'",
        "In response to 'Quiet quitters are now often leaning away from the \"hustle culture,\" which puts work at the center of life, and instead are shifting to the idea of boundaries and a life outside of work. Quiet quitters can also be employees who are choosing to set better boundaries at their job by not working over the weekend or late nights to get something done or answering messages outside of business hours, FOX Business reported.\nSo, Minnesota is in the top 5 states with common sense?  I'm not doing \"bare minimum\", but they pay me for 40 hours, they get 40 hours.  The rest is mine.\n\"Quiet quitters\" sounds like a term made up by upper management to try and shame people into doing work for free', a user said: 'More like getting Quiet Fired...  Get a minimum raise, get pushed to do other departments work, expect to work overtime and not take breaks, not getting required resourced to actually do the job....  slowly getting pushed out the door.'"
