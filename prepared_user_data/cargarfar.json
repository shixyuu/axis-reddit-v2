        "In response to 'LOL …\nHORSESHIT\nits the demographic hole of Boomer retirements and the small size of Gen X that we have known about for decades\n“The crisis we could see coming”\nhttps://www.marketplace.org/2023/08/31/labor-shortages-baby-boomer-retirements/\nThe demographic shift Piper’s preparing for in his business has been predicted for decades. “This was the crisis we could see coming,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a consulting firm focused on small- and medium-sized businesses. “The conditions that prevailed for almost our entire lives — excess supply of labor caused by the size of the baby boom — has now come to an end.”\n“The onset of the pandemic, with the acceleration of the retirement of the boomers,” Brusuelas continued, “has created a confluence of events where we have a labor shortage that’s verging on a crisis, that’s going to cause big changes in firms, with respect to wages and flexibility, and public policy.”\nWorkers age 25 to 54 have largely returned to the workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that group’s labor force participation rate, or LFPR, was 83.4% in July 2023, up slightly from 83% in February 2020. But participation among older workers, those 55 and up, remains 1.7 percentage points lower than it was before the pandemic (38.6% in July 2023, down from 40.3% in February 2020). The LFPR for those 65 and over has fallen 1.5 percentage points.', a user said: 'Exactly. Most Americans surveyed believe the economy is much worse than the Fed or media is admitting. This is due to cost of living beyond wage appreciation. Couldn’t image the majority of people feeling unhappy about their finances while simultaneously voluntarily cutting back on their paid hours or paying jobs.'"
