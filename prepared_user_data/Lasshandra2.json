        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I low key have a vibe from certain co-workers that they are qqing.\nMy workload keeps doubling so long ago, I started using any lull times to do prep work. This way, in crunch time, I’ve already done the detail stuff that requires careful, tedious work.\nI get more worried when there is a lull because it means crunch is coming.\nI haven’t tried qq. I’m getting close to retirement so I will have to reduce what I do, while I shift it to the new people. I use the plural because I carry several disparate responsibilities, unlikely to be ready-capable in one new employee.'"
