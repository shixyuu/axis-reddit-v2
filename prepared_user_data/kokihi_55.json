        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'I work in a union shop, and when my supervisors piss me off I do\nexactly\nwhat I'm told. . . . . . . And\nONLY\nwhat I'm told.\nWorking as instructed still means you need to be instructed.\nI also regularly admonish new hires for working off the clock. They don't start paying us until exactly start time, so if you come in early, even if you punch in, they don't pay you until you were scheduled to start.\nI think this is a stupid rule, so when I get there early I sit on the conveyor belt that is required for work to happen and play on my phone. They can't turn the belt on if someone is on it, so if they want to start working they have to ask me to move.'"
