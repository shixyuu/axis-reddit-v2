Left a horrible job, didn't rage quit, but rage told my boss I'm done, it can be today, or 2 weeks, whatever don't care your choice but Im letting you know this was the last straw.  Worked 2 weeks, it was all management. Checked up on the old guy there and asked how it was going, he said much better, asshole plant manager fired the whole front office, only the plant manager and second asshole in charge left, so their so busy hiring new assholes my department is on easy street.  Other than the 6 person department is down to 2 and trying to hire 4 more.  SO, SO, SO glad I left.'",
        "In response to 'Yup. We thought so, too, but when you have a company that is half union, half non-union, you get some really crazy policies that can easily be abused.', a user said: 'Bet there was a significant amount of turnover involved as well, nobody to push through a decision on keeping or firing somebody on long term leave.'"
