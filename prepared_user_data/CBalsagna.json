[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/6357ek17i7w91.png', a user said: 'As someone who is in a position that requires ~10 years of school, I will be happy to inform you I do whatever the fuck I want at my job and there are no consequences.  I can't even count how many times I have been talked to about leaving early and not letting people know.  I simply don't care.  They know I don't care.  We know they have to talk to me and they know I won't do shit about it.  It's pretty great.  My hope is everyone can make it to a position like that where it's far more expensive to find your replacement as long as the work gets done.  The work always gets done.  Fuck these people.'"
