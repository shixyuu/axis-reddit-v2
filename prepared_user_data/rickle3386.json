        "In response to 'Original Post: Gen Z is quiet quitting because we've seen millennials suffer through economic hardship. Companies can't sell us a pipe dream. [External Link]: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-quiet-quitting-work-ethic-millennials-money-struggles-2023-10', a user said: 'I'm 59. I've never been part of an organization (work, sports team, club) where those not choosing to go above and beyond were recognized as or became leaders. They never surpassed \"worker bee\" status and never had the eye of their manager, coach, etc. If you want greatness, you need to be great. Just doing your job (\"acting your wage\") is the minimum acceptable level to remain employed. When times are tough, who do you think they save?\nI've worked for major organizations and I own my own firm. I was considered a star because I went above and beyond. That led to senior leaders connecting with me at retreats, conferences, training sessions. That created enormous opportunities that don't happen for \"average\" employees, nor should it. Why would a company care about getting you more responsibility, income, title, whatever if you're not willing to go \"balls to the walls\". Do you think the third string QB gets any consideration from the head coach if he's just going through the motions at practice? No way.\nA coach once taught me, \"work your ass off, do your best, be the best teammate, lay it all out there. It doesn't guarantee you success - or a starting position - but not doing that almost ensures your failure.\" Really good words to live by.\nI know you'll think of me as an old dinosaur but that's the way the world works.'"
