        "In response to 'Original Post: What is 'quiet quitting,' and how it may be a misnomer for setting boundaries at work [External Link]: https://www.npr.org/2022/08/19/1117753535/quiet-quitting-work-tiktok', a user said: 'Closing your laptop at 5 p.m. Doing only your assigned tasks. Spending more time with family. These are just some of the common examples used to define the latest workplace trend of \"quiet quitting.\"\nSome experts say it's a misnomer and should really be defined as carving out time to take care of yourself.\nI suspect a lot of us do this from time to time. Pick a slow week and just put in your 40 and turn work off in the evenings and weekends. Seems healthy to me.'",
        "In response to 'Shouldn’t this just be “maintaining a work life balance” ?', a user said: 'Ideally, yeah. I'm in a weird situation where part of what I get paid is based on billables, so there's some extra pressure on me to bill more than 40 hours a week (and even billing 40 week means I'm putting in more than 40 hours).\nAnd I know others have the fucked up situations where there's pressure to put in more than the 40, and then the anxiety if you don't do more than the 40 that it's going to haunt you when you come up for raises and promotions.'",
        "In response to 'what I get paid is based on billables, so there's some extra pressure on me to bill more than 40 hours a week\nWhat a fucking hell. Where is this pressure coming from? You or the company?', a user said: 'A little of column A, a little of column B.'"
