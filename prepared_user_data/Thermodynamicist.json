        "In response to 'Original Post: \"Working to Rule\" NOT \"quiet quitting\" [External Link]: https://imgur.com/a/LAimDzs', a user said: 'No. This is a slippery slope.\nSimply ceasing to go over-and-above the norm (which is likely to be over-and-above the contract) in search of a promotion is likely to be labelled as quiet quitting.\nWorking to Rule\nreally means going right up to the contractual line and doing the bare minimum.\nIt only really works with a strong union because if you really do it then you end up in an uncomfortable position, at constant risk of punishment for accidentally\ncrossing\nthe line (or being caught in a position in which you cannot evidence that you have not crossed the line).\n(FWIW, I'd rather be on strike than work to rule and risk accusations of incompetence.)'"
