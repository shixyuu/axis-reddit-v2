Very bluntly, your coworkers are not your friends unless you want to make them friends - they're just other people being paid to do similar or related work.  If they're smart enough to figure out that they can do\nless\nwork for\nthe same\npay, that's management's problem to notice and fix.  This is literally hating the player instead of hating the game.'"
