        "In response to 'I've got an interview next week for a promotion. I'm going to do my best to knock it out of the park, but I really don't expect to get it. If that's the case I'm done, just the bare minimum until retirement. I've went so above and beyond that I really feel I deserve it. We shall see.', a user said: 'Good luck.  I was recently not chosen for a promotion for acjob that i had be doing for a year and a half.  They wanted to finally have an official position.   Gave it to another guy who had worke a lot with the hiring manager.  Its all bs.  However, it sounds like he does not have time to breath, so i probably dodged a bullet.  The extra 15k woukd have been nice.  But still may not be worth it.'"
