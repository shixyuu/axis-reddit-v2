        "In response to 'How do you plan lessons for all your classes during work hours and have enough time to grade? I’m having a tough time not thinking about work when I’m not in school.', a user said: 'I have this problem, too (in year 17). Part of the problem is four preps. All are grading -heavy ELA. I just can't seem to get the groove where I'm not spending 10 - 12 hours outside of school to keep up. I do leave the building and say no to anything new, but I have to take work home or it doesn't get done. And I don't grade everything, participation and spot checking for as much as I can. There just aren't enough hours.'"
