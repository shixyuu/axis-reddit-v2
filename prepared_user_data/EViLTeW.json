        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'When I was 20-something I told \"my boss\" (who had the exact same job title and description as me) to \"get off his fucking high horse and help deal with tickets\" - I immediately regretted it, 3 days later I saw a job ad for my position (why was I looking at job ads? guess!) and 2 days later they fired me for \"stealing company resources\" - What was I stealing? I had given myself a VPN account on our firewall so I could connect off hours and update our servers. That's \"the same as stealing\". I asked how what I was doing was different than allowing off site access to voicemail. They told me \"this isn't a discussion\".  Oddly enough, they ceased to exist about 2 years after that. I had stopped regretting my actions long before then.'"
