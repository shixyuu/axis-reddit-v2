We've went above and beyond in our duties. We stayed those extra hours. We've completed tasks in our off-time.\nAnd for what?\nA raise under inflation, if we got a raise at all? Wages that still require us to live with roommates? We're quiet quitting not because we're lazy, but because we've tried to give our 110% and didn't see any return.'"
