        "Quiet quitting Update: wow, the support!  Thank you all!\nWill now only refer to this as \"Just doing my job\"\nStarting today, I quit working for free.  I won't manage the school food pantry, sew for students or school programs ( uniform alterations, letter jackets, CTE jackets, prom dresses), work the gate or track meets, cover hall duty for others, support fundraisers, sponsor or coach teams, provide snacks to students, participate in staff potluck meals.\n I will arrive 2 minutes before my designated duty time and leave 2 minutes after hours.\nI will take off every Friday to help my family, and take off every PD because I have yet to attend a worthwhile PD (I have only been teaching since 2001, a valuable PD is unlikely to occur in the next year).\nI have 80+ days of leave accrued, and I will leave as few on the table as possible. \nThere is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.",
        "In response to 'Some  of my fellow “teacher friends” call working to contract “acting your wage”.\nWhen I started easing up on unpaid/unacknowledged work, I was shocked at how much I had been doing. Good luck!', a user said: 'I was really surprised, when I made a list.  We gotta stop doing that shit.'",
        "In response to 'I believe teaching is absolutely the poster child for professions where employers milk their employees' passion for the work. They know you got into this because you care about the kids and their wellbeing, so you will therefore go the extra mile without any prodding.\nI own my own business, and I still don't believe that I worry as much about my work as all the teachers in my family do.\nI'm not sure exactly what the solution is beyond collective bargaining. It's one of those things where everyone will use the kids as a cudgel to beat you to get back to it, but you're no use to anyone burned out and resentful.', a user said: 'Yes.  All of this!'",
        "In response to 'One coworker used to comment how amazing it was that I walked out at 3:00 every day. She made it sound like I must be super organized and had my work done. No, I just left it there. The comment also had an edge to it, like me leaving “so early” was somehow sketchy. Duty day/contract hours, if it can’t get done then, it’s not getting done. Fuck the martyrs.', a user said: 'You go, Teach!!!'",
        "In response to 'Congratulations - We need more teachers like you.  What are you going to do with all of that extra time?', a user said: 'Spend time with my grandkids!'",
        "In response to 'Isn't this simply \"doing your job\"? These were the terms in your contract, yes?', a user said: 'I and 1/2&1/2, teacher/ para.  We don't get a contract.  Not enough respect for that, I guess.'",
        "In response to 'Gotta give grace where you can. Schools and admin have plenty of difficulties that are often not apparent. Not every situation can be ideal. But yes, you are certainly not required to do anything beyond your agreed duties. That's obvious.\nJust gotta do your job to the fullest, and take care of you too. Keeping yourself sane is a part of the job as well. You are not a number or a cog.', a user said: 'I have spent 10 years giving grace to my admin. It almost feels like enabling his inept leadership. Done.'",
        "In response to 'I consider quiet quitting to be just showing up and doing just enough to look busy til someone notices you're not doing your job and you get fired. Free money til you get fired.\nOtherwise, it's just \"acting your wage\" and you can't be (justly) fired because you're doing what is required of you.', a user said: 'Good advice! Tho w/o a contract, in a 'right to work' state, they can shit-can me at any time.'",
        "In response to 'Yes, but without just cause, they still have to pay you unemployment. So if you're doing exactly what you're required and nothing more, they don't have a valid reason to fire you.\nBUT if you're not doing your job, and they write you up for it and give you a chance to \"do better\" and you don't, then they can fire you for poor job performance, which may get them out of paying unemployment.\nMy ex got fired from his job, and they said they had video of him not doing his job and that he'd been written up for it (false). When unemployment asked for these records, they didn't provide it, and he got unemployment.', a user said: 'My teaching and para evaluation is always exemplary.  I am always there (hence the 81 days accrued, they buy out (at $20/day) any over 70 days each June). \nThat won't change.'",
        "In response to 'Well then you're just acting your wage. There's nothing wrong with that.', a user said: 'Thanks!'",
        "In response to 'I did that last year and it was the only way I made it to June. I had to let go of SO much of my perfectionism and allow work to just not get done quickly or at all. Everyone lived, I didn’t get fired, and the students still showed growth. It felt Bad, but continuing to do all that extra work would have absolutely 100% killed me.', a user said: 'My role model! Thanks!'",
        "In response to 'My school tried to make me do extra hours for free because the person before me did it', a user said: 'Yeah, they can kick rocks!'",
        "In response to 'Stop using this phrase.  You're working your contract.', a user said: 'Yes, but as a 1/2 teacher 1/2 para, I don't have a contact. I live in q \"right to work (fire w/o cause)\" state.  WORKING THE WAGE is marvelous!'",
        "In response to 'Do it.', a user said: 'Yes!'",
        "In response to 'I see quiet quitting as simply doing the damn job you were hired for. The buzz word was invented by salty employers to try and make us feel guilty.', a user said: 'I truly don't care how salty the admin gets.  I would have to dig a hole to find my level of respect for them.'",
        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is literally propaganda. The real term is called doing your job, no more, no less. That's what all the ceos do to get ahead anyways, along with paid positions in multiple company boards at the same time (overworking for the same time at different jobs).', a user said: 'Yes.'",
        "In response to 'My contract day is 7:45 to 3:15. That's all they get unless I'm getting paid a stipend.', a user said: '7:40-3:46. 2 minutes to walk in or out.'",
        "In response to 'At our school, we get off at 3:15.\nParking lot is vacant at 3:30.\nPrincipal tells us to GO to our family.', a user said: 'I like your principal'",
        "In response to 'You gotta do what you gotta do.', a user said: 'My boundary has been breached.  I'm teaching my classes and supporting students during my para hours.  Then I'm playing with my grandkids or reading a book.'",
        "In response to 'There is no such thing as quiet quitting, only acting your wage.', a user said: 'Wonderful phrase, thank you!'",
        "In response to 'I love this and the responses!!  I’m rooting for all of you!', a user said: 'I know! What wonderful support!!!'",
        "In response to 'Giving your “some” rather than giving your “all”.', a user said: 'Yes!'",
        "In response to 'Sounds like your still giving them 4 minutes a day for free! Lol.\nGood for you though! Employment contracts work both ways. It lays out expectations for the employee to follow. If they wanted more, it should be in your contract. Like other have said, you're not quiet quitting. You're working to expectations. I absolutely hate that term and how it has been used to shame people for working to expectations. If employers want more, they need to own up to it and ask for more.\nAs far as your PD comment, I stopped going to PD in 2017. I felt the exact same way. There was nothing I was learning and I could use my time better. Surprisingly, no one noticed. I guess monitoring PD is just as worthless as attending PD.', a user said: 'This is marvelous!'",
        "In response to 'I would get in trouble if I missed too many PD days. You’re bold.', a user said: 'Coaches and FFA miss 75%'",
        "In response to 'Great! Can you really take off every Friday, though?', a user said: 'The secretary who is retiring is doing that.  Why can't I?'",
        "In response to 'All the parents that pay your jurisdiction taxes that ultimately  pay your salaries/wages are going to sorely miss all your free daycare. Oh well, let them suffer, seeing as the rich assholes stack the school boards and choose their cronies to be the principals and superintendents. Karma is a real whore.', a user said: 'And choose to override valid faculty decisions!'",
        "In response to 'It's called work-to-rule, and there's nothing wrong with it. No offense, but you were kinda dumb to do all that stuff for free in the first place. I've been dodging extra work since my first teaching job in 2008.', a user said: 'I can be a pretty slow learner. In my defense, I am 1/2 Canadian and being overly nice may be in my genetic code.  Overcoming that shit.'",
        "In response to 'I really and truly need to figure out how to stop working for free. It’s easy for me to tell new teachers to work to contract but then I work on the weekends and get to school 2 hours early every single day. I hate this. I am not thanked for this. There is no promotion for this dedication. There’s nothing at the end except my own exhaustion and feeling of defeat.', a user said: 'Let's form a support group. I can bring cheesecake bites.'",
        "In response to 'I did this. Unfortunately they took it out on me when it came time for my annual review. They rated me poorly on professional development. I countered that I was earning a doctorate degree at the time so how can I be doing poorly in professional development. Schools are petty so be prepared to deal with them fighting back. I had to give up caring when they reviewed me.', a user said: 'My apathy about admin opinion as at a very therapeutic level.  I know my students learn and grow.  The rest is just EduCrap.'",
        "In response to 'Handle your business! I like your boundaries. I’m trying to help my Teacher friends set boundaries. Weekends and evenings are personal time. Even if I’m just staring at walls, I will not work evenings.', a user said: 'Teacher friend stated \"if they can hire another damn football coach, they can hire an evening supervisor\". She is right.'",
        "In response to '8 and out 🤗', a user said: 'Yes!'",
        "In response to 'THIS IS THE WAY', a user said: 'Thanks for the backup!'",
        "In response to 'Good for you!', a user said: '😊'",
        "In response to 'with the leave time, make sure it doesn't go into your retirement days first!  in my state, you can get earlier retirement time by banking the SL!', a user said: 'Thanks, I will check!!'",
        "In response to 'Be careful here, and proceed cautiously, our contracts include a line another extra duty as needed, not sure why you are seemingly at your wits end; proceeding as you are stating may paint you into a bad corner and the consequences could be steep', a user said: 'Appreciate the advice.  I have options outside education.'",
        "In response to 'Perhaps you just haven't found your campus yet?', a user said: 'This one was better at first.  Most of staff has turned over in the 13 years I have been here and the admin's spine has been replaced by jello.'",
        "In response to 'I was at my elementary for 13 years, then made the jump to high school, was rough at first, now completely worth fight thru the shitty years', a user said: 'Glad you found a good fit!'",
        "In response to 'The phrase \"quiet quitting\" is capitalist propaganda.\nStop using it.', a user said: 'Okay'",
        "In response to 'Since you're not a union district what's to stop admin from finding BS performance excuses to use against you and eventually fire you and perhaps put a black mark on your record for future jobs?\nOr is the idea that you're retiring or leaving teaching anyway?', a user said: 'Not sure what I will do. If they fire me, I will collect unemployment.  I worked in healthcare. I could go back.\nMaybe I will open a coffee shop. There are never enough of those /s'",
        "In response to 'Is your accrued leave personal days or sick days? If they’re personal days, by taking them you are working to rule and that’s cool. If they’re sick days you’re abusing sick time not to mention letting down your students.', a user said: 'According to the HR person, \"they are your days\".'",
        "In response to 'JC, that was a lot of extra that you did.', a user said: 'Yeah.  I have schmuck tendencies.'",
        "In response to 'Work to rule!!!\nIf they let you go, you should find a labour lawyer and sue them after', a user said: '\"Right to work\" state.  I have watched our teacher association rep and lawyer tell unfairly fired staff \"you have no bargaining power.  Take the best severance offer\"'",
        "In response to 'There is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.\nYes and no. I'm certainly not going to tell you there's no value in having a union. But you don't need to be recognized by the NLRB to organize your coworkers to work to rule with you. The more people do it, the easier it'll be for everyone, and also the more impactful.', a user said: 'Agree, and I have been a member of the \"Association\". But I have also seen them tell staff that they are basically without rights to appeal and fight a decision.  In my state, striking will cause your certification to be pulled and your pension to be lost.'",
        "In response to 'Ok, but I'm not telling you to strike. I'm not even telling you to form a union. I'm telling you to encourage coworkers to do what you're doing, which is doing the exact amount of work you agreed to do.\nAll this fear is why things are never going to get better in places like that', a user said: 'Agree!'"
