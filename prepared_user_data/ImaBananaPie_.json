Not only is it not fair to constantly make you  do overtime without any compensation, it is straight up disrespectful to you as a person to assume that you would time and time again sacrifice yourself, your family, your hobbies and passions, friends and your literal life as if it’s normal and natural.\nI am working to be able to live. I’m not living to work.\nI don’t mind doing overtime from time to time if it’s absolutely necessary and there’s no way around it, like when there is an emergency or something. But don’t make it the norm.'"
