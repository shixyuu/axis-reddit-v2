        "In response to 'The reality more often is that you get to a position and then stop advancing, either from too-stiff competition at the positions you're applying for or because you're perceived as too valuable in that position. At that point, it becomes more beneficial to go to a different company for better pay, or a perceived chance at upward mobility.\nI think your last sentence answered your question. The companies that don't care losing their best workers probably do what you describe, but those who want to retain talent know that they need to increase the pay as the competence of the worker improves or they will lose him/her.\n\"The hardest workers get promotions\" sure looks good on a coffee mug, though.\nIt's not just a slogan. It should be the guiding principle for a manager who wants to maximize productivity that he/she gets out the employees.', a user said: 'Nah managers get very quickly threatened by that behavior lol. Even when I worked for an international multi-billion dollar corporation the entire upper management had no idea how the actual stores ran. Being too good was the quickest way to get scrapped. The way to move up was by doing your job to the T. Anything outside of what the handbook said you should be doing would get you in trouble, even if it was necessary to prevent massive losses and damages or even injuries.'"
