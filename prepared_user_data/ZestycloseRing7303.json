In the US the only higher cause of bankruptcy is medical debt (another ridiculous system designed to drown the poor). They also take a huge chunk of the middle class and ruin their future; forcing them and the next generation into poverty.\nAll credit cards are ran by scum, it’s a purposely evil system.', a user said: 'it’s a purposely evil system.\nIt's capitalism working as intended.'",

They would need to fire and re-hire  you with a lower salary to accomplish that, but doing so is considered unjustified dismissal so it gives you ground for legal complaints.\nIt sucks to have you doing quiet quitting a week into the new job, but at least you know that things won’t be getting any better so you can move on with looking for another job.', a user said: 'YeAh BuTT iN MuRiCa wE HaVe FrEeDuMb.'",
