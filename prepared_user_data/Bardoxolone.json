        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'Should you put effort into something that has no payoff? Is that really the question you're asking. Answer is, yes it's total ethical to utilize the university money/ time to find an exit. Perhaps they should have used more money and time to retain you.'"
