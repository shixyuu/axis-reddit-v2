        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'Yeah completely burnt out.  My company is a WFA org and I work mostly central time while living in SF.  It's not a healthy life.  I am leaving even though I haven't been here a full year because I need some semblance of life now that things are reopening due to COVID unwinding.  It seems like a lot of people are on that page as well.\nI don't see us going back to the 9 to 5 Monday through Friday grind but I do see people wanting to hire in the area for more frequent meetups.  Its not healthy to never leave your house and depending on your schedule you may barely have 5 minutes to shove a burrito in your face.'"
