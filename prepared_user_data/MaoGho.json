        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'What I learned is not to quit out of revenge or because you are bored . Quit only if you found something significantly better, even if you are happy with your current job \nI feel you . I am exactly doing this right now. I was doing almost double the work that I am supposed to do . I was short from burnout . Applied to multiple roles within my company. I didn’t get them and they promoted people who are far less qualified due to relationship and networking. I am working now but taking it very easy. I am using the extra time to apply for jobs, take online trainings…etc. things are going smooth at work and I am sure I will get something nice eventually. Revenge quitting was never a good solution.'"
