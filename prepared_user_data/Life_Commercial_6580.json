        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'Write it with ChatGPT and call it a day. Of course it’s not “unethical “ to do what you have to do to save yourself from this mess. Being on soft money at this time is the worst possible position.\nFor what it’s worth, I’m tenured and I’m looking for a way out because it’s clear my research is essentially kaput.'",
        "In response to 'I'm not sure heavily AI written grants are ethical as you are asking unpaid peer reviewers to sink days into reviewing AI slop.\nI would try and make a research direction pivot, no matter how credible, and see how it pans out. As a reviewer, if I saw someone departing from their research direction due to current administration priorities, I would be very sympathetic and look to be as supportive as possible.', a user said: 'I am not sure I agree it's always slop. Depends how you use it. It's just a time saving tool. I think in the future people will stop considering its use as unethical. I don't think we all signed up to be amazing writers if we are in engineering or science and if your ideas are good , I personally don't care what tool you use to help you write them down. If I was in English literature maybe I'd think differently.'"
