Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'Employers think it's ok to get the maximum amount of work out of their employees for the minimum amount they can get away with paying.\nIt's only fair that employees do the minimum amount of work they can for the most money they can squeeze out of the company.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting: why doing the bare minimum at work has gone global | Work & careers [External Link]: https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/06/quiet-quitting-why-doing-the-bare-minimum-at-work-has-gone-global', a user said: 'Complete management bullshit to cover the fact that they are still obsessed with presenteeism, where being seen to be at work is more important than actually doing work.\nThe insane thing is that if you are good at what you do and you crack on with doing it rather than dicking around chatting or getting involved in office politics you can be far more productive than any number of the type of people who send emails at midnight or whatever.\nFor pretty much my entire career I'd be in the office by 07:30 and be gone by 16:00. Never worked weekends unless I had to catch a flight somewhere to be there on a Monday morning.\nSure, there were times when you had to put extra hours in to get a project over the line, but that was the exception, not the rule. I always had excellent feedback on my appraisals, and never had a problem getting pay rises.\nBut when I was in work, I worked like fuck. No pissing about, just crack on with the job. The only thing people didn't like about me when I had to manage them is that some moaned that my standards were too high. But then I never liked managing people. Lazy fuckers a lot of them :-)'"
