        "In response to 'How the fuck does that make sense. If they arrested more, and then the DA refused to charge them, They would actually have stats to back up this statement', a user said: 'Make solid arrests and shame the rest of the system.'",
        "In response to 'Oh so the DA is fine prosecuting the Palestine protestors and infringing on everyone's 1st amendment rights, but Madmax style motorcycle roving gangs, nah, yeah those are perfectly fine.', a user said: 'How many of the motoclowns were arrested and turned over to the DA? They didn't get a chance to make a decision to prosecute or not.'",
        "In response to 'If you’re so concerned why don’t you actually rally to vote for DAs and judges who will actually hold up their end of the equation?\nI’m struggling to understanding… if cops arrested these people over and over and they keep getting let out without charges and every now and then someone dies or gets seriously injured in a chase, what exactly would your response be? That’s good enough? Or would you then, finally, complain like this guy about DA and judges and policy?\nI despise these bikers as much or more than anyone, and yet even I can acknowledge the authorities who actually have to interface with the assholes have a point, while the soft hands type away on Reddit', a user said: 'DAs and judges can't do anything about people who are never arrested.'"
