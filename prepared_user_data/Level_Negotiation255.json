        "In response to 'I learned a long time ago that you get the same 2.5% raise as everyone else regardless.\nI'm only now coming to understand that my stellar attendance does not, in fact, matter. I\nnever\nget sick and so I never take sick time.  I've got so many unused days built up...\nAnd I recently realized that I'm only doing it because I feel a sort of pride about being \"the guy who never calls out.\"\nBut fucking\nwhy?\nAs you indicated, it doesn't affect my pay either way, so screw it man--starting this year I've been taking the occasional mental health day. I have a really cool apartment, I deserve to spend some time there!', a user said: 'I used to be that guy too. I was never late, rarely took a personal day, never caused any drama, had one of the highest productivity rates of anyone in the factory where I worked. I prided myself on having a good work ethic. You know what it got me? Not a damn thing because I didn't kiss the plant manager's ass. So I quietly quit.'"
