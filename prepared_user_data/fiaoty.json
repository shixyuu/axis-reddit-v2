        "In response to 'Ang minsan mahirap is yung pag pabibo ka sa work, sayo ibibigay mga extra load pero walang extra pay.\nI'm in that age where I just report for work and just do whatever the contract expects me to do. Whenever may pa-extra, if na-assign ako then light load naman, eh di g. Pero wala nako sa bibo phase, matagal na. HAHA.\nI clock out from work on time, I never have to think about my co workers doing OT , coz apparently our work is different naman from each other, and if marami pa sila gagawin it's not my fault naman na. I always grab the chance to go home early if meron chance.\nKaya sometimes I feel irritated when a co worker of mine is dinadamay ako sa tasks coz masyado siya pabibo. I experienced din na yung boss from dating work ko since sya and deputy head ng organization, pag may events sya kumakain lahat pero samin naman nya idedelegate. never considering if marami kami ginagawa', a user said: 'Totally agree with your point. You are there to work and to get paid that's it. Clock out on time. Don't do unpaid overtime. Don't be pressured by peers saying wala kang pakikisama, we are one family and other BS quotes. Why, if you get sick from work will they pay for you and take care of your family? BE SMART PEOPLE.'",

My boss likes to parinig how new hire employee B is going above and beyond service, yeah just wait till he catches on to what's really an exploitation by the system and watch him turn like the rest as everyone does eventually.. stupid greedy fucks'"
