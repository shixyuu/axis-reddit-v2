        "In response to 'Original Post: SPE quiet quitting I never thought quiet quitting could be so detrimental to an organization.\nMy spe went from being a superstar spe in the workgroup to nobody home. He was involved in a ton of projects and was well respected by probationary examiners.\nHis out of office teams status message used to be a mile long with many alternative POCs for his projects ... now its like \"off till monday, no phone/email access, contact any workgroup spe\".\nJunior examiner actions get zero feedback and are quickly signed.\nYet morale is high and smiles all around, right?', a user said: 'Wow thought it was just me. I'm experiencing the same thing with my SPE. He was never that 'on it' but always responded to requests and emails. I've sent him 4 emails in the last month. 1 required him to get back to me, no response. The rest would typically get some confirmation or acknowledged. NOTHING. I messaged and asked to schedule a time to speak with him about something. He just ignored it. Is there other things going on with SPEs we don't know?'"
