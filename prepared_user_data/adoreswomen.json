With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'there is only one economic problem, the crazy extreme concentration of wealth.\nit's a purely political problem.    vote for pro-worker candidates.   if you haven't been doing that, but were seduced by fake culture war stuff, well that's just what happened to this country.'",
        "In response to 'Honestly the only real thing you can do is look for a better job with a better employer, unless you want to open your own business. Other than that there isn't really much that can be done to fix this', a user said: 'you can vote for a union sympathizer for prez.'"
