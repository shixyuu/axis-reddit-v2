        "In response to 'Chat GPT really points this out.   I asked how to get Universal Healthcare in California.   We already passed a ballot initiative about 4 years ago.   Chat GPT stressed it is insurance companies lobbying politicians ( like our Gov. Newsom who campaigned on Universal Healthcare, bailed on a legislative dem trying to put it in play last January.  Crickets from Newsom.  Then I read he received $1 million from health insurance companies to shelve it!). I liked Newsom but that broke my heart.\nNow if we can get past the corruption ( big ask) \nHereâ€™s the ChapGPT synopsis.\n1.) Lower age for enrolling in Medicare.   50.\n2.) Raise the minimum income level for Medicaid/ MediCal family of 2 to at least $100,000.\n(The currently unrealistic level is around $35,000 for 2 people where anyone making minimum wage cannot even qualify.).\n3.) Have everyone pay into a Universal pool like we do in California for SDI.   Either thru payroll deduction or at tax time for self employed.\nThen our government is not paying subsidies to insurance companies but to a Universal Healthcare Exchange funded by taxpayers.\nWhy are our taxpayer dollars funding subsidies to Private Healthcare Insurance?\nChat GPT would ask us all this question.\nWhat is your answer?', a user said: 'Why are you asking a computer program comissioned by capitalists?'"
