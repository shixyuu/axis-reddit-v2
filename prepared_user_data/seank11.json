No, it's just work-to-rule â€” and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'This whole thing is fucking nonsense.\nNot everyone has a goal to climb the corporate ladder. Some people want to show up, do their job, collect their paycheck and go home. If people value work life balance and low stress over salary increases and increased responsibility thats fine, not everyone needs to have the same priorities.\nFucking sick of everyone acting like everyone needs to try to climb the ladder. People have different motivations, deal with it. Any good manager tries to understand what their direct reports want to achieve with their job, and work with them to let them achieve it. Guilting people into going above and beyond when they dont need to is disgusting.'"
