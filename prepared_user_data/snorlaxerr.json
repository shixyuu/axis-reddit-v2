        "In response to 'Curious on how one gets started on game dev in today's era ?', a user said: 'Already replied in other comments, but here again:\nBest is to start by learning the basics of making a game, it is pretty easy if you already understand programming concepts, OOPs, etc.\nI am not a hardcore programmer but I understand logic/structure/algorithms\nAnd then understand game design - to understand what makes a game fun. Level design, game mechanics, economy etc.\nThere are many free videos available on YouTube - pls don't take any paid courses, free knowledge is enough!'",
        "In response to 'Best thing is to not start at all. Too much competition and low salary. Only few people make it to where he is right now.', a user said: 'You are right - I have also been indie devving since 13 years. Only few people make it is also true.\nAnd job market for games in India is pretty terrible.\nBut if you have a knack for thinking differently or doing cool stuff visually (creative coding), you should try it out!'",
        "In response to 'Thats true. You can start with godot but you'll need way more passion than skill in this field imo', a user said: '100% true, I have seen highly skilled devs (way more than me) just be stuck in a job because they don't have that fire/passion to make their own games'",
        "In response to 'Your journey inspired me man, I wanna ask you, what‚Äôs you overall view on AI/gaming/cloud gaming?', a user said: 'AI has changed developing a lot - overtime I have relied less on freelancers and shifted to AI for small projects (simple word/math/puzzle) games. I use Cursor + React.\nGaming is difficult, I started with android apps - sometimes I wish I continued down that path as I did quite well for my age.\nPast few years were difficult ngl!'",

        "In response to 'Apart from personal network, which platform do you mostly use to get work or hire freelancers?', a user said: 'Hire Freelancer - I don't like Fiverr, they have that 15-20% comission which I feel is not worth it.\nI find devs/artists through LinkedIn only in most cases and from my previous freelancers.\nGet work - the publishers I work with, or through some game studios over LinkedIn'",

        "In response to 'OP, Love the Humble Brag.\nRegarding your statement \"my schedule is not hectic at all\" ... you don't talk about all the HUSTLING you need to do as a contractor.\nI now get freelance project requests regulary from a couple of publishers. I hand them to freelancers or use Cursor to build most of them.\nSeems like you are on an autopilot. How long will you glide before competetion comes and eats your lunch?', a user said: 'nope I don't really hustle as a contractor. I did couple of years ago, not anymore.\nthere is no competition here, the pie is quite big!'"
