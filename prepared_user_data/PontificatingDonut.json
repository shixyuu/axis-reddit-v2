Employers know that employees aren’t doing anything and yet still enjoy the feeling that workers feel so scared to lose their job that they stay late anyway. It’s not productive to the company, the country or the family but we still do it because it makes the employer feel better. The more honest thing would be to say that employers like to torture people for no reason other than it makes them feel better'"
