        "In response to 'I'm guessing you're not unionized. My uni currently  couldn't hire a summer adjunct unless full-time instructors didn't want the class.', a user said: 'Same here except non-unionized faculty. That would never fly with our summer session.  We still have a semblance of faculty governance of educational policy through our voluntary service academic senate.'",
        "In response to 'I have been politely declining and actively ignoring requests for personal service for the last 2 years. I've been overloading my schedule because my retirement is directly proportional to the average of my highest five salaries. And there really just is no time for me to do personal service. Unless you are directed by your supervisor, I would just quietly pretend you're not getting the emails. I feel like they don't deserve a response, honestly, and I think it's best to just let the request pass on by. I think responding it to it brings too much attention to not doing it, but ignoring it, you can just pretend you didn't get it', a user said: 'Your overall strategy seems smart, defensible and completely understandable. But not responding to emails seems kinda of a jerk move and disrespectful of the other people trying to serve the institution. Is there more to this story?'",
        "In response to 'Orrrr....hear me out.... ALL professors (or at least tenured ones) stop letting administrators trample you by ceasing all service', a user said: 'If I refused all service, we would have hired senior administrators that were far less understanding of faculty concerns'"
