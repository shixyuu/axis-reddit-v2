        "In response to 'I see it as valid, but I can see that angle too. I broke working from home. I am not vocal about it, internally or online, because I'm in the minority and don't want to be the guy who says to the teacher that they forgot to assign homework and ruin everyone else's time.\nI had a hard enough time with feeling productive enough to begin with. At an office, having people around me helped me stay on task. I never was able to WFH when it came to homework or studying, and had gone out of my way throughout my life to go somewhere outside of my bedroom to be productive. I didn't think I would ever be in a position that it wasn't as much of an option.\nI think this is naming what some of us have gone through, and what might be happening to more people as time has gone on. I know I can't be the only one, but I also don't think I'm in the majority.\nMaking it seem like it's a choice is where I have an issue and where I think it's problem. Calling it quitting with alliteration makes it catchy, but I don't think people who it's really affecting are doing by choice. That ties it to the perception of not wanting to work.\nCorporate profits have SKYROCKETED in the last 2 years, the numbers clearly and without a doubt support this. If there is a downturn in productivity, it's not affecting the bottom line. We need to rebalance the productivity metrics and employee earnings because it's really out of whack.', a user said: 'Amen üôè'"
