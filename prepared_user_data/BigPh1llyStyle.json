        "In response to 'I’d seek out honest feedback on why you didn’t get the manager role and do some self reflection. They probably didn’t interview you and think, they are amazing, but let’s pass them up and pull in somebody external because we love disgruntled employees. There has got to be some gap in you or your skills for their needs.\nThat said, put your time into finding the next thing and let this go because you won’t interview well with a big grudge on your shoulder.', a user said: 'Adding to this, being a great employee doesn’t make you a great manager they are two different skill sets and not entirely transferable. You said you’ve been doing this job for a few months, I’m assuming the external hire has more than a few months experience. It stings, but doesn’t automatically mean you were wronged. Get feedback, see what you can learn from the external hire while turning off all the extra work you’ve been doing for free. Use that feedback and skills you pick up from the external to get you a role elsewhere. Good lunck.'"
