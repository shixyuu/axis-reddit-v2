[External Link]: https://v.redd.it/oss4az9norxe1', a user said: 'I like their style…\nWe had someone doing this, actually throwing stuff out in general. \nThey were getting done 3-4 hours early every day. Lead was talking about it and they weren’t going to ask how they get done so fast and let it ride for a while.\nThink they lasted around 4 months, could you imagine lol.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'Well they want to pay all these “useless” people the bare min, oh wait you mean they want more than the bare minimum of productivity though…\nSounds like a fare exchange to me.'"
