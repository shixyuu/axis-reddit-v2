        "In response to 'Yeah, I am a Gen-X'er who got my first job in 92, then first full time job in 1996, started @ $5.50 per hour.\nI applied for financing, but credit was so new it was impossible to get approved for a car loan without having a 50% down payment, and with that in mind, I could not afford a car, so I had to bicycle commute everywhere. It is truly something from a science fiction book that cars are so easily financed these days\nI was bringing home $172 per week after taxes, 1 bedroom apartments were $500 and up, if I looked 10+ miles from work, I had to live with roommates and not have a bedroom and paid $75 per week.\nAfter 6 years in the steel industry, I eventually worked my way up to $12.25 per hour, by then the cost for the same 1 bedroom apartment had doubled, so still had to rent from others.\nI got by because I only had to feed & clothe myself, but seriously, if you think Gen-X earned livable wages, you are seriously deluding yourself.', a user said: 'Good lord. I received $5.15 per hour at my first job in 2004. Wages here are embarrassing.'"
