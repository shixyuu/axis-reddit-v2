        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'I used to be of the old mindset of work hard & you’ll get somewhere.\nThen a year ago I got another minimal allowed raise for a 2nd time. It finally clicked that I was doing 60+ hours a week on salary and wasn’t getting anything for it. Well, except more work.\nSo on a Monday I started just 40 hours per week to the minute. Didn’t rush my work and just did what I could. Laptop only went home on days where I was WFH or was going to be bad enough weather to not risk my life.\nThat 1st weekend I was lost. Had no idea of what to do with 48 hours of no work. But you know what? I slept better, ate better, started losing weight and my mood became dramatically better!\nBoss bitched I wasn’t getting as much done and I just kept at the 40hour week explaining I can’t do 3+ people’s work and this is a time trial to show what really is my work load.\nNothing changed on their end, got no additional help so that resume got the 2024 update and started looking.\nAll that work helped me get a new position for a significant pay increase at a different company. Good news here, it’s a straight 40/week and nothing goes home!\nWon’t waste my time again! Working your pay is what needs to be done anymore.'"
