Just from my personal experience though. Was in a car accident last year and the state trooper was so kind and nice whereas APD showed up 30 minutes later and didn’t even talk to me. State troopers may be hard asses but I feel like they “care” more than most. Again just my experience, I know a lot of people have bad experiences with cops and state troopers so not trying to discount that.'"
