Some of us have finally figured out that is a real thing. We still go to work every day we are supposed to.  We still work our hours.  But we aren't checking email at night.  We aren't working on the weekends.  If the boss gives me more work than I can do in a day - some of it won't get done while I shut down my computer at 5:00pm. And I'm fine with that.'"
