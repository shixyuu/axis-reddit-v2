        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'I have quit Walmart 4 or 5 times. And have a total of about 5 years there under my belt. Started as cashier, service desk, cash office. Then went to fresh cap 1 for awhile. Normal cap 1 and then finally cap 2 for my last 2 years. I threw the truck almost every day for those 2 years.\nThere was even 1 day where I threw the truck and worked both sides of the line all by myself because I came in early to help set everything up. Team lead said he’d help me but went to the office to mess with the schedule. Store manager comes over and stares at me going HAM. Picks up one box off the line and then leaves to ask the team lead what is going on.\nA normal day would be me throwing the truck, breaking down the pallets after first break, then breaking down the HVDC truck on the other side of the store. And then stocking my assigned grocery aisle and usually someone else’s because I would finish early. I believed in the company and that the hard work would pay off. I was wrong.\nNow I’m at janitor at a hospital that is union. And make $20 something an hour. And all that is expected of me is that I get “my” assigned work done. Not anybody else’s.'"
