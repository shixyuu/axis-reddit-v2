        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I wish. With all the extra things we are required to do, quiet quitting will be next to impossible because we are a right to work state with some, but not a lot of union support, so our evaluations this year are based on our new PLCs and homogenization of instruction. But our subs sure are - very few want to pick up a job as COVID quarantines pick up in our school district. Honestly the only thing keeping us afloat is the fact that our faculty genuinely likes and respects each other so much that we have each other’s backs. Otherwise we’d all leave the profession.'"
