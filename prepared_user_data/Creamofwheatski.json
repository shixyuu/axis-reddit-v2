He sits in an office all day making phone calls. But if me and my fellow operators didn't come in one day the place would go to hell and hundreds of thousands of dollars would be lost. These \"job creators\" mostly do jack shit and make tons of money off of our labor and then have the audacity to act like they are better than us.'",
        "In response to 'Basically if you’re not willing to fight for and sacrifice everything, including your life, for a company that doesn’t give a shit about you then you’re quiet quitting. Regardless if you do great work or not, if it’s just the bare minimum and you’re not doing literally everything for the company, then you’re quiet quitting.', a user said: 'Having a work life balance is a problem to these employers. If you aren't crying yourself to sleep at night stressing about work, they think you are a problem. The capitalists can get fucked as far as I'm concerned. I am not doing extra work for no extra pay. Fuck you, Pay Me needs to be the mantra of Gen Z if this shit is ever going to change because us Millennials dropped the ball and let the Boomers fuck us real good because most of us didn't realize our parents set us up to fail until it was too late.'"
