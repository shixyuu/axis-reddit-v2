        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'Im a dumb ass millennial. I used to work at Walmart for $6.40 an hour and they made me clock out and keep working if my hours were close to 40... Sure I was apart of a settlement, but that doesn't mean I actually survived it.\nQuiet quit everything. Your life isn't worth their wallets.'",
        "In response to 'Wtf. They made you clock out and continue working? That's such bullshit. What was the settlement like?', a user said: 'Yea fear was a tactic employers used all too well back then. They used to say things all the time like:  If you won't do it then someone else will, meaning that I'd get fired and be out of a job. That or, well there's the door if you don't like it..\nI worked there between 2005 and 2007 and I received a check for about $2,000 like 10 years later for all the hours they owed me. I remember one time on Christmas Eve, they wouldn't let me leave until I got all of the carts back in.. off the clock. It was a pretty big class action lawsuit against Walmart tho.\nI'm just so happy to see people valuing themselves and their lives over these corporations that literally just see us as the grease they need for their gears. I honestly have never been the same from it.'",
        "In response to 'Wow you deserved so much more than that. What a shitty company.', a user said: 'I appreciate that a lot. Thank you. They are a shitty company for sure.'"
