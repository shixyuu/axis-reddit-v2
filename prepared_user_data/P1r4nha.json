        "In response to 'The \"work ethic\" that didn't really exist? My observations living in Japan have been that there are two types of \"Japanese work ethic.\" One is the master craftsman who dedicates their life to their trade in pursuit of perfection, sometimes to a toxic level which more or less abandons their family responsibilities. The other is appearing to be busy without accomplishing anything, as is typical in the corporate world, which isn't really a work ethic at all.', a user said: 'Had the same impression like 10 years ago. Also the unproductive \"overworking\" until you're so tired you can't do shit, but at least you collapsed on your desk than in the train to or from work. I guess what changed is that now they're admitting it.'"
