        "In response to 'I work in software so salary is the main cost to my employer. They obviously want to pay me as little as possible for as much output as possible which they can then resell for profit.\nIf I bust my balls to get features out as quickly as I possibly can then there is simply more work after that. If I am lucky I will get a \"well done\" in a company meeting and if I really fight my case I might get a raise. The only way to get market rates is to get another job offer and then threaten to leave.\nThe sales team get a bonus when they close a deal but the devs get fuck all when they deliver a massive client project. There is no incentive to deliver more than the minimal expectation so why should I give away my time and skill for free?', a user said: 'The only way to get market rates is to get another job offer and then threaten to leave.\nI've given up threatening. I just leave, and say \"the pay was too low and the raise schedule too slow\" in my exit interview.'"
