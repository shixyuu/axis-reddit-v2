        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: 'I am definitely working on that. I've gone above and beyond for 2 years and they hire someone with more experience and make them an office manager. I want to do less but it's stressful when my boss is eating lunch behind me and I feel watched. Thinking I need to slow down lol...\nThough last week I made a boundary and didn't talk/complain about work when I got home. I think it helps??? I mean when I'm at work I'm anxious as hell and swear I'm gonna job hunt as soon as I get home, which I do a bit, then try to enjoy my time cause I literally don't get paid enough to cry over this company.'"
