That isn’t quiet quitting; that’s a combination of Lutheran passive aggressive politeness our grandmothers perfected in church basements for 70 years, sneaking out on Friday afternoons to head up North during the summer and seasonal depression during the winter. We can stay at a job we hate for years doing the bare minimum next to that bitch Deb, but I’ll still buy wrapping paper for her kid’s hockey team because poor kid has Deb as a mom and I hate that bitch.'",
        "In response to 'I feel like I'm not quite following this since my passive aggressive skills are not honed enough being from out of state, but holy cow I love that last bit about Deb. Golden.', a user said: 'You didn't move here; you just finally came home. Minnesotan is more of a state of mind so one day it will just bubble out of you like a Juicy Lucy.\nMy grandmother was the first daughter born in America to Swedish immigrants. Going \"visiting\" - especially after church - with coffee and baked goods is a battleground. I still remember being 13 years old when an elderly woman passed me a millionaire shortbread bar, admonishing me to \"not be so goddamn fussy\" - when I had declined only twice and not the customary three times. What a fucking weirdo.'"
