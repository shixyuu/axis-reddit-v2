        "In response to 'That many companies conducted exit interviews with employees leaving during that time was a good idea, Grant said, but “I would much rather see employers conducting entry interviews or stay interviews.”\nThis reminds me of when I took a Human Resources class in college and the course was going on about how apparently more pay isn’t a priority for employees in the workplace. The past few years proved that concept to be bunk.', a user said: 'Who needs pay when there is a ping pong table in the break room?  Perks are great, who doesn't love Fridays off in the summer and donuts once a month but if the company doesn't pay enough to cover the bills they don't matter.  Too many companies under pay their employees once they get them in the door, the starting pay might be fine but annual increases of 1%, 2% or nothing add up, more importantly they add up to the people who've been there the longest, the people with the most institutional knowledge, the people that when they quit are really hard to replace.  There just doesn't seem to be any effort to retain an employee once hired.  Considering the cost of on boarding a new employee it just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.'",
        "In response to 'I have bounced around several companies and they all follow the formula of:  offer a wide pay range with the upper end that's nice, only offer middle range with vague promises of increase, annual pay increases don't even match inflation, complain about high turnover rate as of it's not their fault. \nRinse and repeat.', a user said: 'Yep sounds like my company, the longer you stay the less they pay.  I spent 7 years trying to get a promotion -every boss said they'd promote me and every boss left before reviews.  Once I got my promotion I understood why they didn't want me to have it, the bonus is 10X more than I had before and the pay increases are 2-3X, apparently the peons don't deserve raises.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone else's departments like completely falling apart due to people quitting / quiet quitting? We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: 'up that money to about $150K and you will get the talent you need.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: What leaders need to know about quiet quitting… aka the labor rebellion [External Link]: https://v.redd.it/xravs6qh8ot91', a user said: 'It's a good argument and an interesting argument but I still don't think it's correct. I've been through multiple good times and more bad times and one thing the younger part of the work force hasn't seen is extended periods of high unemployment, not 5% but 8-10% for years.  When time are bad people will take whatever they can get.  When they have to choose between doing a shitty job and their family not being able to eat they will choose that shitty job nine times out of ten.  Right now times are good, there are lots of jobs and people see the value in a union, how will this change when times are bad.  Before I get shit on let me say that I was a steel worker in the 80's when all them mills got closed and saw the good and bad of unions and I still am a Teamster so I'm not throwing bombs.'",
        "In response to 'You think that right now is a “good” time?', a user said: 'yep.  If you think this is bad just wait.'",
        "In response to 'I do think this is bad. I also think that if we, as the working class, don’t engage with one another to plan an alternative it will get worse.', a user said: 'Bad is no jobs.  Right now if you want a job you can get one and likely get it pretty quickly and for more than minimum wage.  When I got out of school unemployment was around 9%, find a job was hard and you took what was available -working class or not you still have to pay bills.  So go organize, now is a great time because you can afford to get fired but these times will not last.'"
