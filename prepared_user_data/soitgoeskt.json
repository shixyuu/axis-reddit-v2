        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'My expectation of people when I used to manage teams was that they would arrive on time, leave on time and be relatively productive in between. On the occasion where we had to work outside those hours then we always planned in advance as much as possible and then TOIL was awarded. So my understanding of ‘quiet quitting’ is that I shouldn’t have noticed anything different?\nI’d say if you were someone with limited or no ambition to progress in a career then it’s perfectly fine.'"
