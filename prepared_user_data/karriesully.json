        "In response to 'This probably qualifies as an Unethical Life Protip. I did something similar in the past as an IC at a previous company along with my colleagues when a nonsensical performance metric system was foisted on us:\nIt sounds like at least some of your perf metrics are 1) quantitative and 2) transparent within your company (i.e., you can see or deduce the metrics for other ICs).\n1) make a histogram of metrics for ICs comparable to you\n2) assuming you really are in, say, the 9th decile, compare your metrics to the median.\n3) figure out how much effort it takes to stay, say, at the 6th decile (just above median), and do that much.\nTL;DR: if a bad quantitative metrics system is used against you, you can use it right back.', a user said: 'Make sure your measurable metrics are the same plus a little vs peers. When you’re asked about it - simply suggest that your situation has changed. You’re burned out and your health is suffering because of the overwork. You’ll be performing at the same rate as others with the same comp. If they object - check your handbook for qualifying accommodations - ask for an accommodation via HR. If a pip is threatened - make them show HR your performance and productivity vs others. HR HATES when managers treat employees differently on performance - especially if the comp is the same.'"
