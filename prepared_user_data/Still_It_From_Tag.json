        "In response to 'I’m in the same boat. 12 years and 6 jobs. Moved for promotions in responsibility and pay every time.\nWhen I left my last job, my old boss was pissed! I told him I was leaving, I was getting paid more than what they were willing to pay, and a new title they weren’t willing to give me. He called me a lot of names but “a disloyal snake” was a frequent one. Told me I better be happy there because nobody would ever hire me again after job jumping so much. I’m ruining my career if I leave.\nWhen he hired me he told I needed to change jobs from my current role and do what’s right for me and my family. “Don’t worry about the job jumping because you’re doing what’s right for you.”\nThe smiles and handshakes certainly turned when I gave him my 2 weeks.', a user said: 'He took a chance on you and this is how you repay him'"
