        "In response to 'As a recent grad who started a career this year, I'm so confused by \"quiet quitting\" and why anyone would be upset at it. I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'One of my favorite employees was just there to do her job, get paid, and go home. She was one of my favorites. She was super reliable and did exactly what was expected, her job description, and no more, and I adored her for it. She never gave me or anyone else any problems in an environment where everyone around her (and above her, and above myself) stirred up drama like it was a competition. You couldn’t - ahem - shouldn’t ask for anything more from an employee.\nI want to add before anyone misunderstands, I don’t mean she met the crazy demands so many employers and managers expect, like perfect attendance even if your car was on fire (although we did have one woman come in the same morning her car caught on fire! She was a trip!) or always doing OT or being super outgoing or whatever. She was a human with a life and even if she had to call out neither my boss nor myself thought anything of it other than doing our jobs to make sure we had coverage. She even went down to part time to plan her wedding and we handled it because we respected and valued her. No one should be expected to be perfect. We’re all human. I gave her a glowing recommendation when she found a better job. I was so happy for her, sad for us.'"
