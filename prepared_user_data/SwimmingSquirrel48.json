        "In response to 'I wouldn’t be surprised if Robyn was dealing with some heavy mental health issues. At the end of the day being “hated” by America has to be hard. She seems like someone that is naturally anxious and I can imagine how filming this show knowing it’s a source of so much pain and suffering can be really hard. But I’m sure to some degree they have to continue on to maintain their lifestyle. I try really hard to humanize Robyn as much as I can. I’m not saying she’s perfect but there’s about 15-20ppl in her immediate life that blame her for ruining a family. I’m sure she’s also carrying the weight of garrisons death as well. That’s a heavy stuff for anyone. I don’t think she feels very great or comfortable about her life right now and it shows.', a user said: 'I agree with you. I don't particularly like her (based on the show), but she probably isn't as evil as made out to be. She certainly has (seemingly) acted selfish as we all do at times. That's human nature. And I don't find her to be genuine, but I think it would be difficult at times to be 100% genuine while being filmed.\nIf all of the people viewing my show hated me, and I knew it, I wouldn't want to keep filming. It would make me feel shitty every time I sat down to interview, or the camera crew showed up. I would have massive anxiety thinking about the next film date, from every communication with the producers, etc. I would be spiraling until I was no longer involved in the show anymore. Because I'd know that everything I said or did would continue to be hated whether it was warranted or not. And who in their right mind WANTS to continue to do that. Maybe she might feel obligated to continue for money, etc but she damn sure doesn't want the publicity anymore. It's all negative, and it/she makes herself look bad.\nSo yea, I'd be a fucking wreck too. Even if I was a \"terrible\" person. Terrible people have feelings too 😂'"
