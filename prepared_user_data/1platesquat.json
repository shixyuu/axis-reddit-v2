I used to work whenever I was needed. 24/7. Now I work 8-5. I Fully take my lunch daily and I walk away at 5 on the dot. Also, most down time is used training myself in things that I need to shore up.\nAlso, every ticket is on a 24hr cooldown at least. Unless we are actual pals, I just work my queue.\nThe whole Quiet Quitting thing is part of the corporate push of \"No one wants to work anymore\" nonsense. People want to work, they just want to get paid for it.', a user said: 'I used to be ridiculed relentlessly for walking out at 5pm when I worked at an MSP ðŸ˜‚'",

Iâ€™m careful not to miss anything and always watch my phone for messages, but itâ€™s amazing being able to step away from my desk for 10 minutes and not worry about missing 3 calls'"
