        "In response to 'I get what you are saying but the idea of disqualifying a friendship because someone isn't financially well off or because they need antidepressants is kinda shallow too, and you'll be severely limiting yourself JW or not. Plenty of non JWs deal with personal issues while still being good people who are more than capable of maintaining quality friendships.\nJWs struggle to develop genuine friendships because the entire structure of social relationships is fucked in the org. You constantly have to have a wall up because you are encouraged to rat on each other, so you never have any level of vulnerability or honesty brought in. JW friendships are usually borne of circumstance and obligation, which is why managing anything beyond a surface level acquaintance while in is a rarity.', a user said: 'I don't think it's JUST any of those things. It's not a poor friend, or a friend with psychological issues.\nIt's a poor friend with psychological issues who tries to involve you in those issues while hitting you up for money and always trying to get you involved in drama.'"
