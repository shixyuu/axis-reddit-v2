        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'Sure, but let’s be clear - I 100000% have quiet quit and embrace it wholeheartedly.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting could be the best thing for education. Everyone's definition of quiet quitting is different. Mine is not working outside of your contract ours. Work from 7am to 3pm and then you're done. No lesson planning outside of class, no chaperoning, no working gates unless it involves extra pay.\nWhen you ignore these boundaries, you overwork yourself, can't sustain the position, and you end up leaving the profession and in return your students lose a great educator.\nIf you can't do all the tasks a school asks for you to do during the day, that is not the fault of you, it is the fault of your boss requiring too much of you. If you continue doing these tasks outside of your hours you are effectively telling your admin that this is okay.\nWhen you put your value in working extra hours because it makes you feel like you are \"doing it for the kids\" you are doing the opposite long term. The precedent that teachers have to put so much time in outside of work is toxic and leads to teacher burnout. A shortage of teachers is not good for any educational system.\nI'd like to blame admin, government, or students but the easiest fix is in the teachers themselves. When we overwork ourselves, we effectively hurt education. Only work your hours and if you can't get your work done, let your admin know you don't have the time. Healthy work life balance can keep us going and bring more teachers into the profession.\nEdit: Sorry y'all. I didn't realize how problematic the term \"quiet quitting\" is. I am glad though that it brought some attention to the post which led to some good discussion. I will use a different term from here on out and I am happy a lot of you only work your hours or work your contract.', a user said: 'I’ve quiet quit this year, and I plan on actually quitting ASAP.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'Yes, I have quiet quit to the extreme.'"
