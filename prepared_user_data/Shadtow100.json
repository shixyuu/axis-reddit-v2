I get if you want a promotion or to stand above your co workers you gotta work harder, accomplish more, and this usually means extra hours. However if you are happy where you are, then just putting in the time and effort your paid for is not wrong. I have never worked somewhere where there hasn’t been at least a few people who are perfectly happy in their roles so they don’t feel the need to do any more then they are paid for. If your priority is $ then you work more, if your priority is a balanced life then work is just the means to the end, not the end'"
