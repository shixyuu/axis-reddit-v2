Hard work has nothing to do with quiet quitting. It's about doing the amount of work you are paid to do, that's it. Man or woman.\nI'm a woman that works in a rather dangerous industry, and I just do my job. I don't work as hard or harder than the guys on the floor, I just do my job. That's it. Just punch in, work, punch out. That's all it needs to be.\nBut this is some ass backwards thinking. I'm not blaming it on his age (since he mentioned the 70s) and it might not be his generation, it is 10000000% him as a person. Hands down.'"
