        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'I am hybrid and have been for some time. I work in the office typically 2 days a week (sometimes 3). My commute is only 12-15 minutes depending on traffic, which I know is much better than many.\nOverall my manager and even senior leadership is perfectly fine if I ask for a week or two remote to travel to visit family etc.\nEven our CEO likes his hybrid schedule, so I feel like even he would be bummed if he had to change it. Under normal circumstances, Mondays are designated as a “mandatory” in office day. We have one office (about 2 hours North of my location) that never respects that rule. I will plan trips up there on Mondays to meet with the majority of people. On a typical Monday, there are about 7-8 of the 50+ employees at the office. Because of this, our CEO has indeed grumbled about taking away everyone’s WFH privileges.\nI work in IT (cyber security) and have had many people in my professional network who have been RTO’d over the last 12 months.'"
