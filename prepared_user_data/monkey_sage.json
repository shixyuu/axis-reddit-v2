The moment labour costs start to rise to (struggle to) keep up with inflation, these CEOs are becoming pathetic whinny crybabies.\nIt's absolutely\nfascinating\n.'",

When an employee and an employer sit down and sign an employment agreement which outlines what is expected of both ... apparently that's not enough for the employer? The agreement they signed?\nSounds like an employer problem. If they want their employees to do\nmore\n, then that needs to be in the employment agreement and could change the negotiated compensation.\nThis ... isn't hard, or new, or unusual. It's just, like, how employment works?'"
