        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'There’s so many losers in this thread holy shit.\nI stocked shelves for 6 months, worked my ass off, and got promoted to be the people lead. A year in I’ve mastered the role and now I’m the BTS champ and work more on the floor than I do in my office. Hardly ever have time to “do what I was hired to do” and that’s fine with me.\nIf you just want to “do your job”, Walmart is not for you. Move on'"
