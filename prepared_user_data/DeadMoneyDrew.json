        "In response to 'At my first job out of school, I remember 3 people quit my group at a similar time (~20 total). I got loaded with a couple more projects, and I asked my boss: \"so how do I prioritize here? There's more than 40 hours of work, so what's the most important\".\nHe just responded \"all of it, you have to get it done\". It was a super shitty 6 months (they couldn't hire anyone aka corporate froze hiring even on backfills). After it finally calmed down, I never put more than 15 hrs a week of work in. Acted my wage and coasted another 4 years before joining the train of folks leaving.\nWe have to make them either pay us a ridic amount or hire the needed people to get the job done. NEVER acquiesce to bullshit hours', a user said: 'He just responded \"all of it, you have to get it done\".\nWhen everything is a priority, nothing is.'"
