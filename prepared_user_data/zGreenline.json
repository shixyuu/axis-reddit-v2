        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I think the people who heard about salespeople making absolute bank and want to start a career in sales should definitely read through the comments here. There's a lot of truth and reality that's being said about having a sales career.\nIt's ridiculously common to be motivated and hungry for the first couple months you start a role, and you work really hard, and you can get burnt out very easy. It's not a good feeling. There's a lot of stress that comes with the job. It can be very mentally strenuous.\nSales is a very rewarding career, but it takes a strong mental to be able to weather the constant rejection and pressure of quotas, or if you're commission only, just being able to put food on the table.'",
        "In response to 'It easier to find a job when you have one.', a user said: 'Ain't that the truth. I've been searching for the past month, have interviews lined up with some good companies, have declined multiple offers after researching the companies more and finding red flags.\nI went through my LinkedIn messages and found probably 20 messages from recruiters back in 2017-2018 trying to hire me for SaaS roles that I never even responded to.'"
