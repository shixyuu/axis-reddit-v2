        "In response to 'Original Post: what's up with quiet quitting? I've heard this term \"quiet quitting\" over the last year, indicating that people doing their jobs are somehow not doing enough. If the minimum requirement isn't enough, shouldn't the minimum be reset?  I feel like I'm misunderstanding the meaning of this term.\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/what-is-quiet-quitting-6743910', a user said: 'Answer: You aren't misunderstanding it, you're just missing context.\nA fundamental goal of business is making the best product for the lowest cost. How to make a better product isn't always obvious, but cutting costs generally is. One of the most ubiquitous ways of doing that is to get employees to do more work for the same pay.\nQuiet Quitting is a term invented to describe the current trend of employees, especially customer service and office employees, who oppose or reject that pressure to go more work for free.\nThe reason this has gotten attention in the last couple years is that the job market has shifted away from favoring employers to one that favors employees. Because of this, employees don't feel as much pressure to provide the free labor that and businesses have built their profits on. Many businesses aren't adapting to this well and have spent considerable effort to vilify it.'",
        "In response to 'Thanks for a real answer! To summarize, you're saying that it's a bs term?', a user said: 'Pretty much.\nMany companies used a variety of ways to encourage employees to \"willingly\" give free labor. Sometimes it's a \"this is temporary until we get more people\" followed by them never hiring new employees, or \"this week look good on you when you apply for a promotion or a raise\" followed by no promotion and no rate, or \"your coworkers are working that hard, why aren't you?\" or just \"if you don't like it, youll be fired \"'",
        "In response to 'Remember my first lesson of economy the first line was that a business isn't there to make good products. But to make money.', a user said: 'One of the things that corrupts business (and politics, for that matter), IMO,  was the general realization that effective marketing can substitute for quality.\nA bad quality product might drive away any given customer, but good marketing will bring in 10 replacements for them. So why bother spending money making a better product when you can just make everyone\nthink\nyou have a good product? That's basically the entire business model of Starbucks: Sell shit coffee at a high price and convince everyone it's good through marketing. Combine that with having them\neverywhere\n, and you have a business model that sustains itself even if a better service/product comes along.'"
