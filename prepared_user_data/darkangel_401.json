        "In response to 'Same at McDonalds. I'm only maintenance but they got me dropping fry's and worrying about food then get mad when I leave and all the cleaning isn't done that they distracted me from lol. They scheduled me for more hours and trying to stack more work on me so I called out a few times so now I'm back to my normal hours and work. I do the work I'm supposed to do and I work the hours I'm scheduled. They can fire me if they feel some type of way about me working scheduled hours.', a user said: 'Did McDonaldâ€™s before this. I was back cash. Both lanes and happy meal boxes plus sometimes dropping fries all at the same time ðŸ™„'"
