        "In response to 'The Ducks were fortunate to get the best out of Kelly, before he got burned out.', a user said: 'He doesn't seem like the only coach that looks like they're getting burned out ever since NIL.  Harbaugh and Dabo being the two most glaring examples off the top of my head.  NIL has flipped recruiting and roster management on its head in CFB.  Head coaches are asked to do so much more now.  They're part-time coaches, full-time HR department heads now lol.  I wonder if we'll start to see more Deion Sanders-type characters pop up in HC positions.  Traditional coaches don't seem to want to deal with all that.'"
