Current one is solid but looking for something new. This was the first company in the entirety of my lengthy tech career that wasn’t completely toxic and abusive.\nIt’s fucking crazy that I ignorantly just assumed all places were like this. I made stupid money, and got to work on some fun projects. But I missed countless birthdays(even my own), family events, holidays, and a whole host of other shit. Was it worth it? Absolutely not.\nThey constantly wanted to promote me in to leadership and I always declined. Why am I going to waste even more time and get paid slightly more for another set of headaches.\nI’m elated thanks to a not abusive job, I get to hang out with my nephew on Fridays. We’re going to look at rocket ships(his word for old cars) after his nap since the Woodward Dream Cruise is super close.'"
