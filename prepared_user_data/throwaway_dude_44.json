        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Me male HL wife LL Have you reached that stage ? Quiet quitting not leaving because of kids or what not but just quitting on the idea of romance in your head letting go of the resentment for your own mental health  and accepting that she’s just a roommate now ? We had yet another talk yesterday about it which she acknowledged the situation made promises again and that night it was just heavy snoring, told her today that I’m disappointed that our discussion led to no improvement even after her promises she said but we both agreed to make efforts ( because yeah I turned LL4U after all this time) I told her it’s ok I don’t even want to talk about it, I’m not even pissed as usual , she’s snoring as I’m typing this next to me and i don’t even care i don’t want her anymore and the sad part is the idea of getting to this point used to scare me but now I just don’t care, I don’t even think I love her anymore just that I’m used to her.', a user said: 'This is exactly where I am. We just went six months without sex. She says all the right things — she misses her libido, she misses sex — but actions speak louder than words. Now, she finally told me that penetration had started to hurt. She says she will look into doing something about it but I’m not holding my breath. Last week, she brought up the subject again and mentioned that we should aim for “quality, not quantity.” I just didn’t have the heart to tell her that the quality isn’t great either. After six months, we tried to have sex and it was unbelievably awkward. I had a hard time even getting aroused.\nSo I just don’t bring it up and the issue will likely die a slow death. Every other aspect of our marriage is good, so I don’t want to divorce.'"
