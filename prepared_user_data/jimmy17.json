        "In response to 'If you are doing the minimum required to do your job you are, by definition, doing your job. Seems like common sense to me - why sign a contract to do X then do X + Y?', a user said: 'Exactly. My employer is never going to go above and beyond and randomly give me a load of extra holiday or pay me a load more, so why would I randomly do extra for them?\nIt’s a business relationship, they pay to perform pre-agreed tasks in a pre agreed period of time.\nIt makes about as much sense as being accused of “quiet stealing” by not paying more than you owe at Tesco.'"
