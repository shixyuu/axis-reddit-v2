        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'I love cooking but sliced cucumbers are a vegetable and so are cherry tomatoes if I had to work till 6:30 again.'",
        "In response to 'Saw a dietitian say that ranch doesn’t take the nutrients away from the vegetables. Wow what a game changer! A vegetable with ranch is better than no vegetable at all (I hope)!', a user said: 'I do this but with cheese. Will they eat it with shredded cheddar on top? Great, protein.'"
