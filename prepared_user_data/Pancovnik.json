        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'Firstly, this phrase needs to stop. It is designed to put a negative overlook at \"doing your job\". How about we call it what it is? \"Working abuse refusal\"/\"Employees meeting contract expectations\"/\"Standing up for yourself\"'"
