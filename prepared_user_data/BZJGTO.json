        "In response to 'This is such an insane idea to me. If your vehicle fails for mechanical reasons people can die. I saw a car the other day missing half the lug nuts on one wheel. Other cars completely missing bumpers and body panels designed to increase crumple area and save lives in the event of a collision.', a user said: 'As a former inspection, I'm sort of mixed on it.  Most cars we failed weren't for significant reasons.  Wiper blades torn more than one inch (usually on the ends) probably the most common safety issue.  The braking requirements were so lax I think you might be able pass with your brake pads removed.  It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure neither bumpers nor body panels aren't articles of inspection (and body panels usually do not absorb impact, there is typically a brace behind the bumper that does).  It was rare someone brought in a car they didn't know was going to fail.  Those who know they're going to fail just don't come in.  Enforcement has been practically non existent, so those people have typically no incentive to bring their car in.\nSo while I think it's a good idea to make sure everyone's cars are kept up to some standard of safety, I can't confidently say it's actually doing much to make roads safer.'",
        "In response to 'That's unfortunate to hear about brakes. I've driven friends cars that have horrible brakes, where the pad is just gripping the rotor by a thread.', a user said: 'IIRC, it's the same for all vehicles under 26,000 lbs (anything class C).  So your 4,000 car needs to stop in the distance that 26,000 truck would.'"
