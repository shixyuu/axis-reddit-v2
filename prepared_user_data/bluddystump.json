        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'In any business contract three things are always agreed upon. Scope of work, time to complete, and reimbursement for services. Any tasks that fall outside of the scope of work but require to be done are often referred to as \"Extras\". Extras happen to be very lucrative for the provider since the purchaser is most times stuck between a rock and a hard place needing the unforseen issue to be dealt with in order to complete the project. The same should be considered in your business relationship with your employer.'"
