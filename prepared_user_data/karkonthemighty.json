I've known far too many that encouraged people to put in the extra time, extra effort... and then decide that actually, nah, they're good with the person where they are and at their current pay.\nDo it enough, word gets around and now everyone works to rule, because what's the point otherwise?'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting: why doing the bare minimum at work has gone global | Work & careers [External Link]: https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/06/quiet-quitting-why-doing-the-bare-minimum-at-work-has-gone-global', a user said: 'I've known plenty of people across several jobs that knuckled down, did extra work, stayed longer hours, work on evenings and weekends for free... and got sod all for it.\nOnce that gets around the workforce that going further doesn't get you anything it discourages everyone else trying.\nSo this all seems to me whining from up high that us plebs aren't willing to give extra work for free because it's hit a point where instead of it being isolated incidents there's enough shared awareness that it's effecting across the board. Oh noes how sad.'"
