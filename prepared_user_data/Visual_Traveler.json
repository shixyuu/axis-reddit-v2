        "In response to 'My last job gave us an allotted amount of bathroom time for the month. If we went over we had to go to the doctor, get them to sign paperwork saying it's necessary to go over the time, which costs $35 at my doctor's office, and then if you did go over the time they expected you to make it up. They were literally counting the time in the bathroom, and were telling us to limit the amount of fluids we drank and not eat as much fiber. I got threatened with a write up for having to shit too much.', a user said: 'Drink less fluids and eat less fiber. That’s insane. Basically they were telling you to put a strain (and maybe run into serious health issues down the line) on your kidneys and gut. What’s wrong with those people?'"
