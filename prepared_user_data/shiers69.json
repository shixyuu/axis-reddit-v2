        "In response to 'Original Post: Minnesota among top 5 states for quiet quittingâ€™ [External Link]: https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-quiet-quitting-jobs-2022', a user said: 'No reason to work beyond basic expectations if you're in a work environment that opts to take advantage of this (exploit) rather than recognize this (promote).\nMore companies would rather hire externally than promote internally.\nIf you want more responsibility (and more money) you're more often better off looking elsewhere.\nI see this \"quiet quitting\" language as a means of directing the problem at workers (individuals) rather than at the culture of the companies themselves. This is similar to the tactic taken in the U.S. regarding recycling where the message was that the responsibility lies with the consumer of products rather than the manufacturer. Or, another example, how it is up to individuals to drive less polluting cars rather than on manufacturers to only provide less polluting cars. All are simply ways of shifting the narrative. (It's not my fault, it's your fault)'"
