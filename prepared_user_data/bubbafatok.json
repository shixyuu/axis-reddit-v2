        "In response to 'Original Post: Gail Simone quietly quit comics four years ago, until Marvel offered her Uncanny X-Men relaunch for 2024 [External Link]: https://www.thepopverse.com/gail-simone-quit-comics-uncanny-xmen-x-men-wondercon-2024', a user said: 'I've really loved Simone's team books (BOP and Secret Six specifically) and generally like her work, so I'm looking forward to this.  I do say she tends to do better with low level/street hero level stuff with lots of personal drama, and this Uncanny seems like it will be more of that rather than the big stuff like in the X-Men title.'"
