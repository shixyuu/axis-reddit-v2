It cost me about 100 bucks and took up a lot of my time. I can’t imagine doing all that if you work full time and/or don’t have the extra funds.', a user said: 'Damn in PA all that only cost me like 60 bucks I think 2 years ago…and it took like 10 minutes to do the online clearances, and the fingerprints took another 20 minutes. We have to get them done every 5 years I think. Naturally the district doesn’t pay for them. Lol'"
