        "In response to 'Lol I guess this an improvement on OP's behavior but JFC if people think this is the right way to handle this either. Here's the right approach for an applicant in front of a committee who must sign off on his proposal: just answer the questions as asked.', a user said: 'I get the snapping, it happens, Ive been there and done it. But ultimately I agree with this. Something like “I appreciate the questions and concerns. Here’s the short answer ... and for more detail, I can reforward the documentation or move this offline for additional discussion.”\nI always answer the question (even if it’s the seventh time I’m asked) and point them to where/how they can find the answer in the future (in this case the documentation). Regardless of management level.'"
