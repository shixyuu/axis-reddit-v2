        "In response to 'Climate scientists disagree, they say the only way to deal with climate change is for everyone to seriously reduce their consumption. Companies, governments and ordinary people.\nYou’re just taking part in what the climate deniers want - a big, messy, emotional argument about how unfair it all is, and who can we blame, rather than listen to the science and actually act to cut our consumption.\nIt’s funny that you think they had\none\npr policy, and that you’re one of the smart cookies who sees through it. When in fact you’ve seen a way not to make the hard decisions to act to deal with the problem, while being able to act as though you’re serious.\nYou’re just a part of the industry astroturfing campaign, as you earnestly spread a meme about how people don’t need to cut their consumption of industry products to deal with a problem that specifically requires a massive cut in the consumption of industry products.', a user said: 'Individuals cannot fix a systemic problem.\nYes in theory you can achieve XYZ if\neveryone on the planet did it\n, but that's just fantasy, it will never happen, so it's a waste of time pursuing it.  The change has to come from the top down.'"
