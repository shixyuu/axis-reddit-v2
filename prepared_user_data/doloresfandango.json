        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'I’ve just realised that I’ve been quietly quitting for the last 18 months. Now I’ve really quit!  Cant put up with the BS any more. I was a teacher and now I’m not. Parent BS colleague BS children BS. Outside Agencies BS Senior leaders BS. Especially 10pm texts and being expected to be available 24/7 with pretty average pay. Viva quiet quitting!!!'"
