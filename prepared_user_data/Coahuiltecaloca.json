        "In response to 'Production bonus that no one is able to get', a user said: 'I interviewed for a well known music company that told me that my hourly rate was “end up being $52” I have a PhD, so it was good and made sense . Coming payday I did the math and it was $17 an hour. When I asked what had happened they told me the rest of the money was a “production bonus” I’d have at the end of the month. I resigned that very day.\nThe supervisor was angry that I didn’t give a two week notice, so I just read back to him what my contract said about either part terminating the contract “with or without notice” and never came back.'"
