Softquitting just means ur doing ur job and not giving a fuck. \"Looksmaxxing\" y'all didn't invent \"trying to achieve maximum attractiveness\" that's just called putting in effort. \"Softmaxxing\" y'all didn't invent using moisturizers and skincare\" \"hardmaxxing\" y'all definitely didn't invent using steroids and working out. Y'all can have ur cute little social media terms, but it's kind of obnoxious. \"Sigma\" .. y'all didn't invent trendsetters\nSigned, millennial', a user said: 'It ain’t that serious man.\nYou sound like the adults that made fun of us for listening to rap and saying shit like YOLO. Or for dressing like hipsters and acting like we were super into poetry or whatever was seen as cool in the moment.\nOr even our MySpace top 8. Like, we were just as cringey if not more. The only thing we had going for us was not having the internet our whole lives and that kept us a little more grounded.\nOr that whole “Omg! I’m Sooo Random!! narwhal!” Phase way too many millennials went through.\nGive Gen z a break. They’re trying to figure out this crazy ass world just like us.'"
