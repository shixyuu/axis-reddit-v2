        "In response to 'This is where I'm at. I still do\nsome\nthings outside of contract hours because I'm not tenured and can be fired, and my state doesn't have\nquite\nthe shortage that others do, especially in my content area. So I do grade some over weekends and I stay late a couple of times a week, but other than that... I'm no longer volunteering to chaperone. I'm not going to take on additional duties. I will take my laptop with me to lunch duty and work while I stand there for over an hour. I take my laptop during roaming duty (literally walk around the school for an hour) and post up somewhere and work. I leave as soon as I can and if that means I only have the next day planned, so be it. I have summatives from last month that aren't in the gradebook because I haven't had time. I had Covid for a week (that I got at a fucking pep rally at school) and didn't do a goddamned thing. I've had residual effects from it and have been really fatigued, so I haven't gotten to it. I used to work as a para and work an additional job and I'm STILL more exhausted coming home every day from a full time teaching job than I was as a full time paraprofessional and doing an additional part-time job every day. I'm just really over working harder than literally everyone I know, with more experience and qualifications, and STILL having to put gas on my credit card at the end of the pay period.', a user said: 'This is me. I come in an hour early to make sure I get everything done for the day and the next, but that'll stop next year when I'm tenured.'"
