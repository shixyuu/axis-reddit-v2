        "In response to 'Original Post: What is 'quiet quitting,' and how it may be a misnomer for setting boundaries at work [External Link]: https://www.npr.org/2022/08/19/1117753535/quiet-quitting-work-tiktok', a user said: 'This is literally the dumbest thing ever. Working 40 hours, doing only your assigned tasks and not checking work emails outside of business hours….sounds to me like establishing boundaries.\nIf my company would like me to do beyond what’s outlined in my job description, they can negotiate a higher salary with me. The above is not going “above and beyond” it’s being taken advantage of. I’ll work my ass off on my tasks and do my best to get my stuff done during the work week. I WILL NOT sacrifice my free time to do free work. Sorry not happening!'"
