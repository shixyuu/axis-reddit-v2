        "In response to 'The phrase “quiet quitting” needs to go.\nBeing paid to do what you do and not letting yourself get exploited isn’t quiet quitting.\nEdit: I appreciate the awards but rather than wasting your money on fake internet points I’d much rather you donate it to a charity which helps people still caught in the industry trap that I’ve talked about below.\nDonate or go any buy some gear from\nThe Burnt Chef Project\n.', a user said: '“Quiet Quitting” is the phrase the American employers came up with to shame their employees.  They call it that because they are implying that because you just do your job as it should be, rather than going above and beyond and dedicating your life to it, then you are basically a quitter without actually quitting.\nIt’s tremendously fucked up and I do hope it doesn’t catch on here.  I’ve not actually heard  it said here yet but it’s probably only a matter of time.'"
