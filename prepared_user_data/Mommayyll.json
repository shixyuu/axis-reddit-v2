        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'I don’t like the wording of “quiet quitting”. Because it’s the exact opposite— it’s about finding a way to actually stick with your job and carry on. Messaging matters a lot more than people consider. “Black Lives Matter” should have been “Black Lives Matter Too”. Then we wouldn’t have had all the ridiculous “All Lives” people.  “Defund the Police” should have been “Re-source the Police” as in give them new sources of support, with a wider range of skills in dealing with the public. I wish we would give messaging MUCH greater consideration before just throwing out word soup. “Quiet Quitting” sounds like something a Boomer would come up with. Ugh.'",
        "In response to 'Agree, except I'm done with the police. They don't need more resources so they can kill innocent people and stand around while school children are shot. Their institution is broken. Give the money to social workers and others who can deal with homelessness and the myriad of other social problems. Give the money to the homeless for that matter! Skills don't matter when you are corrupt, racist, and uncaring. And a boomer did not come up with quiet quitting. You can look it up.', a user said: 'I agree wholeheartedly about the cops. When I wrote resource I meant to change our sources of police to re-source them. For example employ a whole bunch of social workers in the force. Also I never said a boomer came up “quiet quitting”, I said it sounds like some thing a boomer would come up with because it’s a bad phrasing. .'",
        "In response to 'The way you frame \"solutions\" is incredibly sus. Social workers have zero to do with any \"force\" and policing should be taken away from unaccountable faux military', a user said: 'You don’t think adding social workers to handle the more sensitive elements of policing would be better than sending out police to deal with EVERYTHING? I’m pretty sure this has already been tried in some communities and it’s working. I’ve never heard of anyone being against social workers being sent out on calls, and I’d love to know more about why you don’t like the idea or find it problematic.'",
        "In response to 'You are so brain broken by the deeply embedded idea that the police has to do everything that you are advocating to employ more police officers, just rebranded as \"social workers\". Social workers should never be employed by the fucking police, they should work on their own terms and actually be able to tell the cops to fuck off if they start acting out', a user said: 'Why are you so angry? Are you aware that some cities have started hiring social workers within the police department, they are dispatched to calls that do not have a violent or danger element, they are not armed, and they help people with resources? They generally respond to mental health crises, and interpersonal squabbles. Some police chiefs, who were skeptical at first, now call the program “indispensable”. These social workers are considered members of the police force.\nI don’t understand your animosity.  You are resorting to insults like “brain broke”, which doesn’t personally offend me because I am confident with my intelligence and awareness of current issues— but it makes me worry about you. You seem to have a lot of anger toward ideas that are already WORKING to reduce police interactions and increase de-escalation in communities.  Maybe you should talk to a social worker. 😁'",
        "In response to 'Learn a little about solidarity. The youngest boomers are 58, they'll be around for awhile. Ageism should not have a place on reddit anymore than racism.', a user said: 'Hopefully you know that the term “boomer” is a pejorative term. “Baby Boomer” refers to a generation of people while “boomer” started with the “OK, Boomer” jokes. In no way does using the term “boomer” imply that I am stating “millions of people born within this generation are ALL assholes who make comments like, ‘I don’t know why these young people these days don’t just save their money to buy a house!’”  A BOOMER is one of those. A Baby Boomer is a person of that generation. I would be guilty of ageism if I had made some overarching statement referring to ALL people of a certain age.\nAlso, just in case you were confused, “Karen” refers to a particular type of woman who throws her stupid little fit in public, but in no way refers to every single female born whose parents picked out the name Karen.\nDo you get it now? Lighten up.'"
