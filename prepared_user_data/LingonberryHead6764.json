        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'To be honest Robyn has nothing to bring to the show. Her entire purpose for years was nagging Kody and Meri not to give up or crying about everyone else. She has had zero personal growth and has nothing of value to film. Her segments with her kids are painful and awkward to watch where the other moms are so natural with their kids ( kids who donâ€™t constantly look ready to cry). Is she slow quitting or is there no usable footage?'"
