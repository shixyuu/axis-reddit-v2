        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'I haven't run into this. I'd be really tempted to turn it into a impromptu lecture on the history of quiet quitting, or working to rule, which is the earlier version which is more apt, really, and then talk about how that switch indicates a bias by making it sound like the employee is doing less than required instead of the employer asking for more than they paid for. It's basically a great starter conversation for conversation, the power of phrasing, slogans, etc. Good for either a history or english class.\nedit to add - and then I'd likely mention that if they were really quiet quitting, they'd be doing the bare minimum of what I asked, which would likely result in a C/D grade - but they'd pass.'"
