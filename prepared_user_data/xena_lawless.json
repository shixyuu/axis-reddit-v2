        "In response to 'Like, I’m sorry your entire generation was fooled into thinking that was how work was supposed to be, but it’s not; and this “work/smile harder!” mentality is at the root of a ton of American problems that no one wants to talk about.', a user said: 'It's both a prisoner's dilemma and an arms race, constructed by and for the benefit of the ruling class.\nIf the people who do more work and just grin and bear their exploitation well are promoted and have better lives, then everyone has an incentive to pretend that everything is fine under even increasingly awful conditions.\nThe people who complain are just losers, relatively.\nBut if increasingly more people realize the system is a scam, and start working together to make things better for everyone rather than just competing in the rat race, that's when the ruling class has a problem.\nThat problem being, slaves who've become self-aware about their situation and decide to work together to change it.\nWe need more people to cooperate with the public and working classes to improve the system - don't just work yourself to death for basic survival.'"
