        "funny that quiet quitting is even a term... [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/7tpkh1cisgj91.jpg",
        "In response to 'ngl, I've only seen \"quiet quitting\"  talked about on this sub.', a user said: 'I've seen it elsewhere, on other social media sites. It seems to be a thing now that people are doing and employers are learning about, and of course are quite unhappy about. But ultimately, \"quiet quitting\" is just doing the minimum amount of work required for your job, and just what you are being paid to do. The fact that doing only what you are paid to do has been given a term and is frowned upon is utterly ridiculous.\nYou want me to do more work beyond my current required duties? No problem. Let's discuss it and renegotiate my wage or salary.'",
