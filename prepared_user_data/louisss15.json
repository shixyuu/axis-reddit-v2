        "In response to 'Reading your post suddenly brought me back to why I quit working for a corporate franchise and started working at a privately owned small business. You are absolutely correct with your description: It was GREAT, at first. By the time I walked out, I had been so beaten down, I didn't even realize it was making me miserable until after I left.', a user said: 'I think I'm in the same boat, but I'm not seeing a good way out. What advice do you have on finding jobs with smaller businesses?\nIt might be the field I work in (logistics), but it seems like any small business either is never hiring or hiring for a low paying customer service position. The only jobs I see with significant pay are at large companies, too far to commute (2+ hours one way) or too demanding (45+ hours per week minimum). Or even both.'"
