        "In response to 'Literally decades of not matching inflation in wage growth, and increasing workloads. Constant denials of requests for additional headcount. Paying market rate for the clueless new guy but punishing those who favour stability despite them having valuable knowledge and skills the business depends on. Increasing expectations of availability and reduced response times. Why didn’t you read the email I sent at 6:30pm last night before our 8am stand up meeting? Layoffs at the slightest hint of a recession. Refusal to invest in tools and training needed to be efficient. Constant requests to just “spend less” but no reduction in targets.\nWhy the fuck would anyone go the extra mile these days?', a user said: 'Honestly they should be applauding and thanking us for putting up with this for decades. It's like an abusive relationship that only ends when the abuser dies of old age.'",
        "In response to 'CEOs are worried about employees setting boundaries.\nFixed', a user said: '\"CEOs are worried about quiet quiting..... But executives don't know what to do about it\".\nMaybe just compensate the employees for the record profits they're helping to achieve? You don't even have to be a crazy altruist executive, even just split 50% of the extra profits amongst the work force of thousands, while you keep the other 50% for like 5 people.\nThat'll do a hell of a lot towards incentivizing your employees.\nEspecially if every other company is still hoarding the full 100% like fricking hob goblins.'"
