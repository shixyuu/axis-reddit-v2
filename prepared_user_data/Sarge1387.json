Quiet quitting is doing your responsibilities and not going above and beyond.\nQuiet quitting is NOT intentionally making mistakes. \nQuiet quitting is NOT neglecting job responsibilities.', a user said: 'I think he confused “quiet quitting” with “sandbagging”'",
        "In response to 'This isn't what quiet quitting is. It's doing must enough to avoid being fired.\nThere was a guy in my job who was looking for another job and then working out his notice. Fine, he wants to move on, no big deal. But what he did was to turn up to work and then just avoid actually doing any work, or anything he did do he'd get wrong on purpose and do it so badly that everything he did had to be checked. He wasn't doing the job he was contracted to do, but because the process to fire somebody is so lengthy (this is the UK) and he was leaving anyway, nothing could be done. Working with him was hell.', a user said: 'That is not what quiet quitting is…you’re referring to something called “sandbagging”'",
        "In response to 'Quiet quitting shouldn't usually lead to being fired. It is just a refusal to go above and beyond and is naturally more prevalent when there is insufficient motivation to do so.', a user said: 'Boss man wants me to go above and beyond? Sure, but pay me above and beyond and I’ll do it. No? Come 4:31pm, take a flying leap, see you tomorrow'"
