        "In response to 'I know someone who worked in house (soft) collections for a high end retailer's credit card issuer. They were incredibly good at their job, winning \"Performer of the Year\" in 2008 and runner up in 2007. That company brought in a new division manager in Q2 of 2009 who promptly decided that too many bonuses were being paid out and raised the goals by a ridiculous amount.\nAnd you know how that went. Some of the people saw the writing on the wall and jumped ship. Others--like my friend--made a valiant but misguided effort to rise to the challenge. Within 18 months she went from top performer to a PIP to staring down the barrel of termination. After she and many others left, the whole department was in disarray and ended up restructuring.\nAll because some MBA didn't want to pay out bonuses to hard workers.', a user said: 'Iâ€™m stuck in my career (not much of one) and have thought about an MBA to help expand my long term earnings opportunities but each time I talk to MBA grads, I usually walk away unimpressed and confused why I should go into debt for an MBA.'"
