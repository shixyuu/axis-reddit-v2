It usually accompanies the search for a new job.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: How is performing your job duties “quiet quitting?” Are you penalized for your efficiency & preventing burnout? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/02qwb6ziqvi91.jpg', a user said: 'They're trying to redefine a term because it's caught on as a description of a secondary effect. Quiet quitting has been defined as the period of disengagement a worker goes through once they've made the decision to quit, but haven't yet resigned. During the pandemic, some businesses saw a similar disengagement from workers who ultimately didn't quit, and the label was extended to that.\nIt hasn't been about working to rule or anything like that. It's been about spending less time actually working during the work day, but not so little that management can justify firing you. Being checked out, spending more time web surfing, taking longer lunch breaks, etc.\nThey want to redefine it as \"doing your job\" because it's being used to mean \"doing your job while intending to stop doing it\", and they don't want you to reach the end of that sentence.'"
