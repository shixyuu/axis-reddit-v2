        "In response to 'I mean it really depends where you are in the world. In EU we have strong worker protection, so it's 30 days only if you've been employed for a short time, otherwise it can be 3+ months that they have to keep paying you even after letting you go.\nThe other thing is, you can only be a probation worker for 6 months. After that you're considered a \"long term employee\" and can't really be fired unless you're caught stealing or doing something else that's illegal or really damaging to the company, and then they need documentation to show you breached the law.\nThere are no \"terms\" that can be written into the contract because the law trumps any contract, and the law says you can't be fired.\nThere's 2 ways a long term employee can be fired: illegal activity, or if a company can show they're doing badly financially. But in that case after they fire you, they're not allowed to hire another person in your place for at least 6 months.', a user said: 'Obviously what the guy wrote applies only in some or maybe just one EU country they're familiar with. While we all have some protection coming from the EU Labour law, each country has vastly different rules.'"
