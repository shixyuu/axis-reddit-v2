        "In response to 'Older millennial here.  During The Great Recession companies prioritized letting off workers who were more junior, so the millennial's got let go while the Gen Xer's got to continue working.  Millennials didn't job hop because they wanted to, they did it because they had to.  Not for a pay raise, but because layoffs would hit them instead of everyone else.  Meanwhile Gen X got to buy into the cheapest stock market in 40 years, and a couple of years later buy into the cheapest housing market in 50 years.  Banks will not let you get a mortgage if you do not have 2 years of consistent income, so even if you saved up for a down payment on a cheap house, you couldn't get it.  Once you could work a stable 2 years housing prices rocketed up then similar to today.\nGen X loves to bitch about their hardship, but their entire life they've made as much as the Boomers (only 2 percent behind), and they missed all of the hardships Boomers went through.  In many ways Gen X had it quite a bit better than the Boomers did.\nToday there are a record number of homeless people, the high majority of them Boomers.  Likewise, there are a record number of people retiring early right now, all of them Gen X.', a user said: 'The talking points just don’t change. You sound like how we (gen x) talked about the boomers when we were younger. One day the folks two generations behind you will say the same things about you. And by then you’ll just be old people yelling at clouds.'"
