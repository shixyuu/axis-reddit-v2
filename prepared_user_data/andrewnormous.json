        "In response to 'Who needs pay when there is a ping pong table in the break room?  Perks are great, who doesn't love Fridays off in the summer and donuts once a month but if the company doesn't pay enough to cover the bills they don't matter.  Too many companies under pay their employees once they get them in the door, the starting pay might be fine but annual increases of 1%, 2% or nothing add up, more importantly they add up to the people who've been there the longest, the people with the most institutional knowledge, the people that when they quit are really hard to replace.  There just doesn't seem to be any effort to retain an employee once hired.  Considering the cost of on boarding a new employee it just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.', a user said: 'I have bounced around several companies and they all follow the formula of:  offer a wide pay range with the upper end that's nice, only offer middle range with vague promises of increase, annual pay increases don't even match inflation, complain about high turnover rate as of it's not their fault. \nRinse and repeat.'"
