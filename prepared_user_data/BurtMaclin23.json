        "In response to 'I live out there. Its still a really low chance. Before Covid a cop sitting in the turn lane checking for expired tags outside HEB was so common I'd have to check the exit from the parking lot.\nNow Bee Caves PD are usually napping in a church parking lot. End of the month have to watch for county sheriffs doing a couple speed traps but otherwise fuck all for enforcement. I'd actually pay either of them to set up traps for people running red lights. Its gotten so bad they could fund the department in a day.', a user said: 'I drove around for 2 years with expired tags. Work sent me to Bee Cave for a few weeks, and I got pulled over 3 times in 4 days. The 1st one was a ticket, and the next 2 let me go since I had a fresh ticket on me. I promptly went and got it taken care of. Felt like I had a big target on my car. They were relentless. Every time I pulled out on the road, they were there.'"
