        "In response to 'Funny you mention that. I used to go to the Chinese consulate in Houston to get my visa for travel. The feds ordered it closed in 2020 and threw the CCP out, claiming they were using it as a base for technology theft and spying. Was a big international mess. Google it. The night before they were kicked out, there were huge fires set behind the consulate walls, were probably burning evidence.\n*edit. I'll be a staying at the Hotel Indigo in the Flushing Queens Chinatown in New York City in about two weeks, Chinese spies are welcome to come say hi :)', a user said: 'Wow I used to drive past that consulate all the time - apparently they were stealing medical and oil and gas data?? Lol'"
