        "In response to 'There are millions of people who own a house and a newer car that are completely oblivious to what's going on out there. Many are shocked beyond belief when life happens and they find themselves looking at having to buy a house or a car.\nMany people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nA mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.', a user said: 'Many people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV.\nI was car shopping a few months ago. People have been paying add-on fees in the $1000s (something like %5000-$7000 above MSRP) just to get a new Toyota Rav4 or Honda CR-V electric. Both dealerships calmly explained the fees, and they were getting them. (Edit- to add I did go with a friend to Lexus, their fees were something like $2000 extra + wait list)\nI believe it is unsustainable too, but my point is people will buy overpriced crap if it is all they can get. People in your situation will no longer sell even if you wanted to move up, making scarcity worse. Crazy market = people go crazy.\nI'm one of the people who sold at what I thought was the height and now pretty much can't get back in without compromising a great deal.'"
