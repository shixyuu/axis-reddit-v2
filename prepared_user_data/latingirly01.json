        "In response to '\"Centers\" or \"stations\" (assuming they're the same thing?) has always struck me as one of those things they talk about in grad school that simply doesn't translate to the real world.  I don't know, maybe suburban and rural schools have physically larger classrooms, but my room barely has enough space for the students/desks in their normal configurations.  I just have trouble envisioning how something like this could physically work.\nEven something like pulling a group for re-teaching (something which I'd love to do)... where?  Any time I've tried doing that it's this massive logistical hassle of having people switch seats and getting confused.', a user said: 'Lack of materials (LIKE CHAIRS) or space is totally understandable, but if you do have those things, centers/stations is great. My students say it’s their favorite part of the day. It does require prep, but it’s much easier if you have 1-to-1 tech.'"
