        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Likewise.  And it hurt like the dickens to know that a job I once absolutely loved now had lost its magic.\nThankfully, I also worked with my best friend who would not allow me to scapegoat my way out of resigning.  She listened patiently to my blame, nonsense arguments, and protests, but remained resolute in encouraging me to find something else.\nJust as I'd made up my mind to resign, my boss moved away, a new boss came in, and I revived (or so I thought).  But it didn't take long for my relationship with the new boss to sour, reach critical mass, and end with a lawsuit.\nWhile I prevailed in the legal action, I realized afterward that I may have been happier had I accepted the truth, moved on, and perhaps found another position in another department much further down the road, as major (good) changes I could never have forseen were in the works.\nThankfully, everything worked out for me.  I delved into an entirely different field (mortgage loan officer), and fulfilled something I'd become passionate about - credit repair (LOL)!  Totally unrelated to what I'd done for the previous 10 years.\nBest to count the blessings you've had, screw up the courage to take the plunge, and move on.  Otherwise, you end up battling imposter syndrome, guilt, and making other people miserable for as long as you stay there.'"
