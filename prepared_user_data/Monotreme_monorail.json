        "In response to 'I'm GenX. We were taught by our boomer and silent generation parents and early employers to go \"above and beyond\" for our employers and to eat all kinds of shit and abuse to be a \"good employee\".\nWe were taught that we were being 'given a job'. Statements like \"we picked you over many others...\" were said so that we'd feel grateful for the opportunity.\nIt's all one-sided bullshit that poisoned us. It was 1930s Depression Era thinking that had people beholden to their employers and strip employees of their actual worth.\nMore and more, young people today (Millennials and GenZ) are standing up for their worth, and employers are angry about it. I'm proud of these generations for refusing to accept the bullshit the rest of us were sold.\nIt isn't \"quiet quitting\". The only thing they're \"quitting\" is being party to their own exploitation, and there's nothing \"quiet\" about it.', a user said: 'Gen X here too. You hit the nail on the head. I’m cheering on the younger generations for breaking out of the horrible loop of “go above and beyond and be rewarded with more work and no extra compensation”.\nI learned my lesson a little late in life but you better believe I’m implementing work to rule here on out. I am tired of working more than one job in order to be seen as a “team player”.'"
