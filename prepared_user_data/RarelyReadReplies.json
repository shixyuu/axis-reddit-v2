        "In response to 'Boss made a dollar\nI made a dime\nThat was a poem\nFrom a simpler time.\nNow boss makes a thousand\nAnd gives us a cent\nWhile he's got employees\nWho can't pay the rent.\nSo when boss makes a million\nAnd the workers make jack\nThat's when we strike\nAnd take our lives back.\nAddendum: thanks for the love, I didn’t write this, just sharing it. Please share it too. Work to rule every day even when they treat you well. It’s only work.', a user said: 'Abso-fucking-lutely this. Only thing I'd add is something about unions maybe. I'm a firm believer they will be key to workers taking some of our power back. Finally got a union job in the manufacturing sector and it is better in every way than the non union job I had prior.\nOld job just keeps turning over, churning through workers at a crazy pace. The only way they can keep running? You guessed it. Shipping in more TFWs they can pay shit and abuse even easier, as they usually don't know their rights. Well, most workers don't, but even moreso for immigrants.'"
