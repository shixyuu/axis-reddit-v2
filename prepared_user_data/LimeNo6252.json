        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'This happened to me when I went on a 5 day trip to Paris with 4 new friends I had made over aummer school. BAD IDEA to travel with people who are basically strangers. Our interests, spending limits, expectations and personalities clashed so much that two of us ended up splitting from the group on Day 3. After that, I was counting down the hours to go home. I hate that it ended like that - Paris is not a trip that happens very often and I wish I could gave enjoyed it more...'"
