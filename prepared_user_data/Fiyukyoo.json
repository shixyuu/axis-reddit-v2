Sometimes common sense takes a backseat.', a user said: 'To be a great coach you need to be both a great leader/manager and know your X and Os.  So when hiring a coach one skill tends to be better than the other and you hope that coach develops that other skill on the job.  That doesn't always happen and leads to bad coaches'"
