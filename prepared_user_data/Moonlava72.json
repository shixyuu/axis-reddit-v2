        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting: What is it Really? Quiet quitting is a confusing term to me, but maybe I just don’t understand it. I have rarely ever given 120% to a job… maybe when I was fresh out of college when I had that mindset. But the years have jaded me. What people call “quiet quitting” (doing the minimum) is what I just call doing my job lol. It’s not like I refuse when they ask me to do more work (tho rarely do they ask), but I don’t SEEK more work out unless I’m just bored. For example, in my work, we work in Sprints and get assigned stories to do for those sprints. I just do those stories — not more or less — unless I’m just bored and have finished my stories weeks in advance, then I may grab a story for the next Sprint. I get paid by the hour so no work means no pay. But it’s not like I can ADD more stories to the current Sprint because someone else still needs to test them and THEY may not have capacity. So, a lot of times I just do things around the house since there always seems to be something to do at home. Have I been quiet quitting for years and just didn’t know it or is doing the minimum not really what quiet quitting is all about?', a user said: 'I stopped doing 100 % a while back so maybe 75%. I do not stress out any more about rushing with the calls I get.  I do Customer service Support for a major Utility company.  I work from home and have for the past 3 yrs.  I just make sure I meet my QA and take calls and make sure I get at least 96% call intake.  Companies do not care if they have to let you go due to lay offs or downsizing etc.. when people ask why are you here my motto is I am just here for the paycheck and nothing else.'"
