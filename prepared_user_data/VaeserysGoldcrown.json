        "In response to 'Original Post: [The Philippine Star] \"Quiet quitting\" is taking over the workplace â€“ what exactly does it mean? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'I fundamentally do not agree with the premise of \"Quiet Quitting\". What even is  bare minimum?\nIf your task is X, and meron kang deadline, or quota, or number of hours, etc. and you hit that, that is not bare minimum, that is doing the job you and your employer agreed on. That's a job well done.\nThe problem here is that businesses want you to kill yourself and go the extra mile without giving you your due, kaya gumagawa ng mga bagong buzz words to make people feel bad about \"doing the bare minimum\".'"
