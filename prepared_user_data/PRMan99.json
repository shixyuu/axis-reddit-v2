        "In response to 'I think that's just a standard contract buyout situation,  and may possible be used too hero with a salary cap if a league uses salary cap.\nFit instance the Blazers bought out Didi Louzada in the summer not because they can't afford to give him his 1.8 million, but because by rule they can use the stretch and waive policy to give him like 280k a year for 7 years, which might help the team get out from paying a much bigger  luxury tax bill.\nThe funny thing about the Bonilla contract is that the Mets did this one time deal with Bonilla because of BERNIE MADOFF. Then owner of the the team was invested with Madoff and he thought he was making so much money that it would be more profitable to invest the 6 million they owed to Bonilla with Madoff, which would make so much money that it wouldn't matter if they had to pay Bobby 30 million from 2011 to 2035.\nOf course they lost all their bogus investments, and even Madoff has died,  but they still have to pay Bobby for another 13 years!', a user said: 'Except they paid DiPietro obscene money for a slightly below average goalie.'",
        "In response to 'Where do I sign up?', a user said: 'Just put the $200 million right over here.'"
