        "In response to 'Quiet quitters are now often leaning away from the \"hustle culture,\" which puts work at the center of life, and instead are shifting to the idea of boundaries and a life outside of work. Quiet quitters can also be employees who are choosing to set better boundaries at their job by not working over the weekend or late nights to get something done or answering messages outside of business hours, FOX Business reported.\nSo, Minnesota is in the top 5 states with common sense?  I'm not doing \"bare minimum\", but they pay me for 40 hours, they get 40 hours.  The rest is mine.\n\"Quiet quitters\" sounds like a term made up by upper management to try and shame people into doing work for free', a user said: 'Lemme get this straight.  Fox News, which skews old, rural and conservative is telling its viewers that no one wants to work anymoreâ€¦ even when they have a job?  Sigh'"
