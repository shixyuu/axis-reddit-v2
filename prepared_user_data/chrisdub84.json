        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'If I felt it was worth it to engage in the conversation I would try to explain the difference between a free education and a job.\nAs a student, you are not producing anything for me. The institution is built for you. It's actually a sweet deal. You are only failing yourself. The benefit you get from being there directly depends on your efforts. I'm not getting paid per A.\nIn many jobs, there is a huge economic power disadvantage between ground level workers and those higher up. Knowing that extra work will not be rewarded, some decide not be be exploited in that way. Making more for your employer won't make more for you. It's actually unfair.\nI think it would be a great moment for a compare/contrast exercise. Kids need to work through logic discussions like this, and see whether their arguments hold any weight or not. There are a lot of misconceptions out there. It's part of growing up to understand nuance.'"
