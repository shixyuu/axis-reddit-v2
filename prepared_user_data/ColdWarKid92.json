        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'Yep.\nAnd there's a difference between 'quiet quitting' and 'working the contract'. The former is a conscious decision to make like different than it has been for the last few years. (I started teaching at a public school in 1999, and 'quiet quitting' was the term I'd been looking for.\nCan you extend the due date in Canvas?\n\"Not when it's easier to take off 10%.\"\nWhat if I send all of my files in separate emails?\n\"What do the directions say?\"\nMy mom wants you to call her when she gets home tonight at 7.\n\"My prep is from 7:30-9 (I didn't choose it) and I'd be happy to call her then.\"\nThey\nnormalized the idea of us going above and beyond\nfor the children\nwhile showing us that we were just a warehouse for bodies. They don't get the\nfull time\nversion of me after the way they screwed us during the pandemic.'"
