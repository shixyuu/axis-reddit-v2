        "In response to 'Everybody is insensitive until it’s them or their kids that’s getting fucked. Funny how that works.', a user said: 'They just don’t understand the reality of today. I’m sure at one point hard work, dedication, and a good attitude made an employer value you; it just doesn’t anymore. They can’t grasp what people face in the workplace today. It’s not the same America they believe exists; because they bought into a lie, tore apart worker protections, and won’t admit they left this mess for their kids.\nAs a Gen-X kid, I’m pissed at myself for not rioting in the streets a lot more often when all this shit started to head south; but by god I’m gonna defend the people telling the truth, keep voting, and keep any kind of pressure on these clowns to right the wrongs of the past 40 years I somehow ignored. We let the generations following us down (especially you boomers), but we don’t have to KEEP letting them down damnit.'"
