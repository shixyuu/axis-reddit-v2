        "In response to 'Original Post: How to Approach Annual Review After I Quiet Quit Almost a year ago, my boss pulled some power move BS and I made two changes as a result: I took work email off my phone and stopped working more than the expected hours. No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a \"good idea fairy\" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't.\nMy boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise.\nSo now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the \"extra\" stuff has fallen away.\nIt will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?\nFWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years. Thanks!!', a user said: 'First, you need to learn the term \"Quiet Quit\". Which is just not showing up or ever talking to them again. You just quietly go away... literally. No notice, no nothing, just stop showing up. You're still there. You just stopped doing extra work you were not recognized or rewarded for.\nAs far as saying you're done doing more, just focus on reporting the facts, see what she says, and talk about hiring an additional person that you can take time to train properly, or promote someone from another department/team into the role. Talk about the extra set of hands can greatly improve the number for next year.\nDon't reward a shitty boss with extra work. I'd ask to help HER out by taking on some of her tasks under the disguise of freeing up her time to do more that will impress her boss - be in a position to take her place.\nIf she's really an ass, she will have noticed you slacked off and might insist you ramp up again, in which case you ask for a new title and a raise to accommodate the extra work. Ask that some of the menial tasks on your plate fall off your job description, and onto a less senior team member (or a new team member). If you get to choose the title, choose something that leads you to your new role in 5 years.'"
