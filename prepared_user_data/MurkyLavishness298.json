        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopüòÇ', a user said: 'My phone is shotty with notifications sometimes. I had my food in front of me today about 10 minutes before I got the notification it was delivered. I heard them outside so I was aware bc of that. You're a dick. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è'",
        "In response to 'Turn your ringer on if you ordered delivery. You want the food you supply the necessary info to get the food to you. If not you don't get squat, or you go get it from the gate yourself\nthis was alcohol so I couldn't just leave it', a user said: 'Your reading comprehension is lacking. The comment you responded to said the notifications sometimes don't go through, not that they don't have their sound on. I have this happen all the time with lots of apps on my phone, DoorDash included. Calling is always better. You're not edgy or cool for being a dick.'"
