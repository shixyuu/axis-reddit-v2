        "In response to 'If you type \"quiet quitting\" into Google News, you will find about 100,000 results.\nIf you type quiet quitting without quotations, you will find over 2 million results.\nIf you type declining American life expectancy into Google News, you will find 28,000 results.\nDeclining US life expectancy gets 61,000 results.\nDoes the news media focus on our lack of healthcare benefits? Our heinous work conditions? On why our lives are being shortened as cost of living soars?\nQuite the opposite - you even have NPR shaming workers for \"quiet quitting\".', a user said: 'Two word tag phrase vs 4 word sentence.\nOf course the amount of results is lower.'",
        "In response to 'Declining US/American life expectancy is a pretty basic search term. That's how the issue is reported.\nWhat would be a simpler search term I should have used in your eyes to better illustrate the point?', a user said: 'That's not the point, you are comparing what is effectively a slogan with a concept.\nThe fact that you are even demonstrating that there is multiple terms (US/American) makes it obvious that one is more specific.\nFor example, an article may be titled, reduced life expectancy for Americans, another may be titled, United States life expectancy on the decline, and another may be more sensational, like, Americans are dying earlier than other countries.\nAll three discuss the same subject, but might not all appear on the same search.\nQuiet quitting on the other hand is a popular phrase, nearly every discussion on the topic will include that phrase near verbatim (both supporters and detractors), and both words are generally more used in other contexts (as well as globally instead of specifying a country), so a search for quiet quitting may return results unrelated to the topic or unrelated to the US'",
        "In response to 'That's not the point, you are comparing what is effectively a slogan with a concept. The fact that you are even demonstrating that there is multiple terms (US/American) makes it obvious that one is more specific.\nThe point of including both terms was to add up their cumulative search hits. Which still fell under quiet quitting alone did.\nJust because quiet quitting is a slogan doesn't mean you can't compare it to the sum of two 4 word phrases.\nThe fact there is no slogan for our declining lifespan is because the media ignores the issue! The media loves slogans for issues they focus on.\nQuiet quitting on the other hand is a popular phrase, nearly every discussion on the topic will include that phrase near verbatim (both supporters and detractors), and both words are generally more used in other contexts (as well as globally instead of specifying a country), so a search for quiet quitting may return results unrelated to the topic or unrelated to the US\nThere are other terms & phrases for quiet quitting. Especially in other countries.', a user said: 'But you aren't making a fair comparison. For example if I simplify the search to 'declining lifespan' which removes these qualifiers of a specific country and generalizes it more there is 63 million results.'"
