It used to be called \"Work to Rule\". Union employees would strictly observe all mandates of the contract including working only those hours covered under it, and observing all required safety practices. It was like the opening salvo when contract re-negotiations were coming up and is specifically designed to reduce efficiency in the management's eyes so they could think about what the employees value was to the company. Sadly, today companies are using it as excuse to fire people because employees  have no protections.'"
