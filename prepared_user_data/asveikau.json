Prosecutors, not the police control investigation. They don't and should not arrest people for things the prosecutor will not prosecute. If it's unclear, they're supposed to consult the protector before proceeding.\nProsecutors in turn are officers of the court. They should not bring cases that they do not think they can win.\nUltimately at the end of the day, we need to select better judges.', a user said: 'Back in real life, judges rubber stamp a lot of bullshit put forward by cops and prosecutors.

The very worst you can get for this is to seize the dirt bike, pay a fine, maybe get points on a driver's license, be obliged to take some kind of safety course. You guys are acting like they ought to get the death penalty, or to serve more time than the average murder suspect.'"
