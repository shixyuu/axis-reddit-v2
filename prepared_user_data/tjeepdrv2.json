As for insurance, probably not as New Mexico did require it then. She also had no id other than ut. Fun times for her in Hyde park.', a user said: 'I think they ignore out of state plates. I've got something with out of state plates on it that still uses yearly stickers on it.  I never did put the current sticker on it and I don't think they've even noticed, since Texas has the sticker on the windshield.'"
