No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'When I was 17 the shop manager went on holiday for a fortnight, and gave me his keys to look after things whilst he was away.\nFor some reason they expected a minimum wage shelf stacker to be doing the managersâ€™ job.\nHell of a mess left for him when he returned.'"
