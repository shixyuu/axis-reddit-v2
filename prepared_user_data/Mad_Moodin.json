        "In response to 'My sister gave me the best advice when I started working. Always give 70-80%, because when your boss asks you to give more you aren't burning out. Only give 100% on a temporary basis.', a user said: 'I said in an interview once that I usually give around 70% which obv. pissed the interviwer off. I was like \"What is the issue? It means that I can do my workload just fine and will be able to give more if needed\".\nShe was like \"Well I'm always giving 100% and on a day like this I'm at 110%\".\nSo i told her \"That is not possible, you look far too healthy for that. At 100% you should be completely exhausted to the point where you can at most fall in bed at evening. 110% would mean you should fall unconcious at any moment now\"\nI didn't get the job, I don't regret it.'"
