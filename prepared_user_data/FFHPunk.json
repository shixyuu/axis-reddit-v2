        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'I've wondered if anyone has just not gone in and kept working. I have a feeling most offices would take weeks to even figure it out and it would be the same as quiet quitting'",
        "In response to 'Took about 6m but a colleague got fired suddenly because of this. No real warning.\nHe was listed as RTO but they were closing the office he was supposed to be going to and figured since the next closest office was way beyond that, RTO didnt apply to him.\nWorst part, they didnt notify his manager or executive until the day of his termination either. HR did the firing all by themselves and notified our manager after the fact.', a user said: 'Still gets unemployment'",
        "In response to 'He did yes,.. but in FL (where he was; im in a different state) unemployment is a bit of a joke compared to what he was earning. Or so i hear.', a user said: 'It usually is but the post was about making them fire you'"
