        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'The population of apathetic JW (PIMQ, PIMO, or faded) seems to be growing substantially. My guess is 20 to 30% of congregants are in this category. As a result, I think JW will simply stop participating in the way the Gb wants them to.\nLocal elders now find themselves as minders. They’re growing weary of that.\nFamily and friends are likely to resist hurting family and friends\nThe governing body is taken with a chuckle and a grain of salt by at least 20% of congregants right now.\nThis might be wishful thinking, but the population of apathetic JWs is growing. The larger their population the more influence they will have. And their influence will gravitate towards normalization.. That’s my guess anyways'"
