        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'You mean doing what you’re paid to do and no more?\nI had a job once where I rarely took time off because management complained if we took more than two days in a row off. We were fully staffed. I had to take a week off for a wedding and the day before I left, the divisional manager told me she’d moved up the deadline for our annual updating process by a month, meaning it was due the day I was to return. It took at least 40-60 hours to complete. I spent that week with every spare moment hunched over my laptop, and got it done but had no time to enjoy the time off.\nWhen i returned, I gave her the report. “Oh, I don’t need this yet. I only wanted to see if your prioroties were in the right order”.\nI left three months later.'"
