        "In response to 'Not anymore! I get being tired of seeing sights and museums. However, I do love me some churches (not religious, just love the set ups). I love being alone, so social connections are not a top priority for me. It's okay to want to leave early, don't beat yourself up about it.\nI used to think the same way, in which, I spent all this money, so I want to stay in this country. How I overcame this thought process was by bringing things to do, like embroidery, journaling, scrapbooking, book apps, etc. I take breaks in between wandering around seeing sights. Depending where I am, I'll just stay at the beach all day, I'll go on a solo picnic, maybe I'll go to a cafe and read. I treat it as I live there, if that makes sense.', a user said: 'Re the churches! Nothing I love more than going into churches to see how elaborate they are! Usually the more random the more surprised i get! I love those little surprises. Recently went to France and felt like Notre Dame was a let down compared to others iâ€™ve seen'",
        "In response to 'Hot tip next time you're in Paris: go to random non-central parts of Paris, and ask people on the street for directions to the Notre Dame. You'll get to see a lot of different churches! (Discovered this \"trick\" by accident back in the eighties, by not knowing that the famous Notre Dame is not the only one, and asking for directions while in the wrong parts of the city :-))', a user said: 'sounds like the most perfect way to get lost. Love it!'"
