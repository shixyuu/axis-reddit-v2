        "In response to 'Correct, itâ€™s very demoralizing to work full time and still struggle. Millions of people are on a treadmill. Working hard but not getting anywhere.', a user said: 'It makes the grind insufferable.  I am working my life away at a very physically demanding job,  with no hope of being able to afford a house/invest in something or even travel. Its a fight to even get a week off work a couple times a year.\nAnd then my friend tells me she just sold a 30 000 dollar clothing package to one couple (two sets of clothes!). That's literally a whole year of work for me.  The lack of a future plus the insane wealth disparity is just so discouraging.  No wonder we are all depressed and fighting anxiety,  lol.'"
