I’d guess about 90% of the work hours performed now would be totally unnecessary if people were actually working the whole time and we eliminated all the useless middle management and nonsense that impedes actual work.  Maybe more than 90%.', a user said: 'Yeah! Like those bullshit meetings that could have been an email or a memo. Or pizza parties that\ndon't\nactually help employees feel valued and appreciated. Or the expectation that someone who's finished all their work by noon must sit there and twiddle their thumbs until 4:30 or 5:00 Just Because, or find some meaningless busywork to do.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'This is a BS term. You were hired to do X. Anything else above and beyond that is extra; that's why it's called\nabove and beyond\n. This is a way of attempting to redefine \"above and beyond\" as \"just part of the job description,\" so they can say you slacked off (and therefore have an excuse to let you go.) You were hired for X; you don't owe them Y, too.'"
