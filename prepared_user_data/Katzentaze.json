        "In response to 'felt like this before, I know this might sound dumb but try to find a hobby you enjoy (put as much effort in these) or go out and walk around a nearby park that has a trail/woody area. I’ve found that nature helps me feel more at ease. You never stop growing, maturing and changing. You might feel like you’ve peeked but you have your whole life ahead of you. Grow your circle, try new foods, places you’ve never been. your story isn’t over yet, so don’t rush to finish it before reading the whole book.', a user said: 'How did you find a hobby you enjoy? I mean nothing brings me joy anymore'",
        "In response to 'I’ve found, when I get to the point of losing interest in everything, I force myself to either (1) do first simple steps of something I’ve enjoyed in the past or (2) try something new even if it sounds trivial or stupid.  Some examples… when I’m not depressed I’ve enjoyed knitting.  So I get yarn and just knit the most simple thing… a scarf.  The act of making something, the motions of, can sometimes trigger a slight interest.  Or feeling of accomplishment.\nFor trying new things, some ideas I’ve tried\n- paint by number (they make adult ones, inexpensive on Amazon)\n- zendoodles.  It’s just doodling, but looks nice.\n- I bought a book on making paper airplanes\n- small kits on Amazon, such as miniature dollhouses.\n- adult coloring books and gel pens\nAlso I’ve found developing my own “inner cheerleader” helps.  So when I accomplish even a small thing, I let that inner cheerleader talk to me like I’m 5 years old and have done something amazing', a user said: 'Thank you, that really helps me to get started 😊'"
