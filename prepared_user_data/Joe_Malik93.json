We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: 'Oh the exodus at my org began about two years ago, though there was plenty of notice to go around. Hell, my boss gave\n9 months'\nworth of notice and his replacement (no way was I taking on that amount of crap without getting\npaid\n) started working\n3 months\nbefore old boss was out the door and $New_Boss is\nstill\ntrying to get basic expectations (like not being an instant expert in our flavor of EHR or not being able to \"implement\" some real organizational structure that allows finance and HR to automate processes that are still paper [yes,\nreally\n]) under control after 3 months of being The Guy, despite having two people added to the department. Me? I'm still popping popcorn and still\nnot feeding the squirrels\nin front of the East entrance, lol.'"
