It's that you do what you're paid to do, and don't do extra work (hours wise or pay-tier/seniority-wise) you're not paid to do. So if someone in your department quits, or a manager decides they're too busy, you don't end up absorbing their duties permanently with no pay raise.'",
        "In response to 'This \"quiet quitting\" shit has got to go.  It's corporate propaganda.  There is no such goddamn thing.  Showing up, doing what you're paid to do, only what you're paid to do, and going home, that's all you owe these fucks.\nThey get to drink up millions and billions of dollars in profits to fund their long term goal of owning the planet while you worry about the fact that your rent goes up 10% per year, your groceries went up 20-30% in the last five years, and if a single goddamn thing happens to you, you will be ruined financially.  Seriously.  Fuck these people.', a user said: 'Right? And in what kind of fantasy world is just doing your fucking job considered any form of quitting?'",
