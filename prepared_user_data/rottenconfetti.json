        "In response to 'Why are people (Khanna and Favs) still doing “when they go low, we go high” in December 2024?', a user said: 'Omfg for real.  The rant about not swearing bc “we” don’t talk like that, we want to bring the best out of people, it’s our magic secret sauce or whatever he said, and we wouldn’t talk like we do in a sports bar sent me.  Like wtf?  You think those people in a bar aren’t good enough? Or you’re protecting me from coarse language in 2024?  Jfc.  It was so patronizing and it’s clear he couldn’t hear how he sounded. Yikes. No wonder they lost rural and working class dems. And I started the interview liking him but had to do a double take and remember he is Silicon Valley and I’m cow valley.'",
        "In response to 'Not even just rural or blue collar workers. Everyone who isn’t super religious swears. Even Silicon Valley tech workers swear a bunch. Hell, I’m pretty sure the PSA guys swear a ton too. It’s a weird position to hold that crosses a lot of demographic lines', a user said: 'It also really feeds into the narrative that politicians say one thing behind closed doors at the bar, but then give the public something else.  Not helpful to confirm that!!!!!'"
