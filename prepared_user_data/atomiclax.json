And of course it's on TikTok.\nQuiet quitting: The workplace trend taking over TikTok - BBC News\nKids today need to learn more about unions and industrial action.!', a user said: 'I heard someone say they were \"quiet quitting\" by taking every minute of their lunch break, only working their contracted hours and not answering work calls at the weekend. Where I work, it's fully expected we do all of that anyway! If my manager spots me online after 6, he'll kindly tell me off (the next day, because he also isn't expected to work more than 8 hours a day).'"
