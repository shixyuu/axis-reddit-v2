        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Happened yesterday. It wasn't  alcohol though.Got stuck at gate. Called. She answered  and instead of giving me the code told me her son is walking to the gate. Oh yeah, I'll pull out of the way of incoming gate traffic and wait for your effing sun. That shit was put at the gate, pic snapped, and I'm  out after waiting 6 mins for a son that never showed up.'"
