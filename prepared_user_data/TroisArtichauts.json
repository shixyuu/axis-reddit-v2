And of course it's on TikTok.\nQuiet quitting: The workplace trend taking over TikTok - BBC News\nKids today need to learn more about unions and industrial action.!', a user said: 'Yeah it’s minging, heard the interview on the radio this morning, she absolutely radiated smugness. I’m totally supportive of people not being taken advantage of and having a clear agreement of what their role and responsibilities are, how they’re recompensed for it and not being bullied to do more for less. But the idea that this is a “trend” the TikTok generation take credit for is nauseating.'"
