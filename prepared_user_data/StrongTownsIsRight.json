        "In response to 'I am highly suspicious of these publications framing the term “quiet quitting” as something workers themselves have come up with as an act of protest against exploitation. To me it smells of false flagging by corporations trying to label their own employees with such a term to make them more exploitable. This term has already entered the mainstream sphere way too fast and unnaturally.', a user said: 'Gimmicky terms like this always enter the business vernacular quickly because middle managers like to have buzzwords to chat about with other managers, and it absolves them of responsibility.  \"We aren't hitting deadlines due to quiet quitting\" sounds better than \"I can't force my people to do more unpaid labor because otherwise they will quit\".  It was exactly the same with the Great Resignation.'"
