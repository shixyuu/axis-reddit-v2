        "In response to 'Spent the last 20 plus years working really hard, putting in loads of effort, having no lunch break consistently, doing loads of overtime and got bugger all appreciation. Just watched whilst young lads got promoted and given pay rises and I’ve not had one since 2017. Couple weeks ago, worked until 10.30pm and I’m only paid til 5. They won’t pay overtime either.\nSo fuck them.\nI’ve handed in my notice and going to another place who i have a feeling are going to treat me better.\nI don’t mind working hard, IF you’re appreciated and it gets you somewhere but I’m sick of putting in loads of effort and getting nothing back, getting so stressed I’ve not slept properly in months. It’s just not worth it.', a user said: 'Often it's those with the brownest noses that progress which is just so very wrong . Those that have mastered the art of looking busy at the right time. Those that volunteer for extra jobs aimed to impress ,at the expense of everyone else . While the team have to pick up the slack with no thanks or appreciation .\nWell done on moving on , i think that's brave , especially after putting twenty odd years in . I watched my dad slog his guts out for his company. They ripped the absolute piss out of him and it was hard to see how it impacted him. He gave them the bulk of his working life and in return they used and abused him. He retired wth nothing but a copy/paste letter from management. Not even a card , not even a little whip round or present . I hate the lot of them for making my dad feel so undervalued.\nI wish you the very best of luck in your new job and hope you can get your sleep back , sleep deprivation can turn you inside out . Look after yourself and enjoy your new life.'"
