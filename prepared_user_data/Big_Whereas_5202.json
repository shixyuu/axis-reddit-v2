        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I’ve been meaning to do a very long adventure and was concerned about this happening. I think as long as you keep an appropriate pace for yourself and don’t overwork your brain in terms of constantly thinking of things to do, it should be manageable. (I struggle with just relaxing as my brains so active and it can take away from the experience).\nBut I totally understand. When I go on vacation.. I want to sleep in my bed after 5-7 days lol'"
