        "In response to 'They aren’t paying though. All of the blue collar jobs are listing about $1/hr more than they were a year ago, which is a pay cut with inflation. Sure, there are plenty of jobs available,  but don’t act like they are life changing opportunities.', a user said: 'Regardless of inflation if you go from a job making 17.50 to a job making 20 you have improved your situation. It's easier now than it has been in awhile to make those jumps.'",
        "In response to 'I think you missed the first part of my response, they aren’t paying $2.50 more and the minimal increase doesn’t help as much as it would have even 3 years ago. It’s not keeping anyone in those industries from living paycheck to paycheck', a user said: 'I guess what I'm saying is this. My brother was making 16.25 earlier this summer. He changed jobs and is making $18.50 now.\nInflation effed him at 16.25. It's effing him now. But he is making more money than he was in June.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Yikes not even sure how to reply to this.\nIf you make 17.50 now and move to 20 tomorrow you are in a better position than you were.'"
