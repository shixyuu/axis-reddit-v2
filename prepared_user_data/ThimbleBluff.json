        "In response to 'Are you a woman? Because oftentimes “fun” or morale building activities- party and event planning logistics, holiday events are pushed off onto women in the office with little thought or awareness into how much effort it takes (think Jim and Dwight when they finally have to plan a birthday party on the Office) and usually cause we enjoy doing it and have a knack for it because it’s what we do in our personal lives as well.\nVenting to each other is a natural stress relief amongst coworkers and honestly part of “managing up” if you are senior on your team, it takes a lot off of the bosses to let people vent to you. He’s an idiot for not understanding that.\nSo no, NTA and keep just doing excellent work with a positive attitude and being “too busy” for extras', a user said: '“Are you a woman” lol. When I started reading the original post, I wasn’t sure, but as soon as the OP mentioned all the extras she was doing and the boss’s response, I immediately assumed she’s a woman and he’s a man. I’ve seen this dynamic play out frequently. In any case, NTA.\nI will say, in some circumstances, it could be helpful to have a private convo with the boss to clear the air and let him know his reaction was unfair and completely backfired. If he’s someone who can be taught to be a be a better manager, that could restore a positive vibe in the office, but only the OP can decide whether that’s a viable approach or would just make things worse.'"
