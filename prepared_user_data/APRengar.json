        "In response to 'Japanese worker productivity has been low for decades.  It is not a new phenomenon.\nhttps://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h02240/', a user said: 'I would argue Japan is the definition of quiet quitting.\nLong hours, but low productivity.\nBut also there's the whole odashibeya phenomenon\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banishment_room\nOidashibeya is a modern employee exit management strategy whereby employees are transferred to another department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened and resign\nThey have quiet firing, not just quiet quitting. They pay people full wages, but with work so meaningless, the employees just choose to quit. Absurd for productivity, but that's just the culture.'"
