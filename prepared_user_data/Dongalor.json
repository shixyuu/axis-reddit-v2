I keep telling them to never get in the habit of doing other's work, or 'just helping out' without being asked.  If you do something long enough without being told to, that just becomes your job and you get reprimanded for not completing it if you ever stop.\nNo one is every going to take things off your plate, you're never going to get that help they are looking into, and they aren't going to rehire that guy who has been gone a month.  All you're doing by doing someone else's job is teaching them that they need less people to get more work done.  You're not going to get the money you save them.  All you're going to get is over worked.'"
