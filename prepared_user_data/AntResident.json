        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Another point is living expenses besides tuition. Some students need to take out loans to pay rent, transportation, and other expenses if they don’t get financial aid to cover them.\nTo give an example, at the university I went to, tuition is “only” $16,000 a year after fees, but renting a private bedroom in a shared house is another $18,000 a year. If you want a 1 bedroom apartment, that’ll set you back an extra $36,000 a year on top of tuition.\nGranted, not every university has housing costs this high, but rent and other non-tuition expenses can easily tack tens of thousands of dollars onto a student’s loan debt over the course of their studies. Especially if they have to take an unpaid internship to get their foot in the door.'"
