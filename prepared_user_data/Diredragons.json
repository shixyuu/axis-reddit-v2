        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'I'm not saying she isn't trying to pull back as much as she can, but they do film in the house. The staged scene about the Tenders wanting to go to church and the Meri coming over a couple of times this season were all inside.\nBut, yes, I do wonder if she wants out. She has long known that the audience widely dislikes her, and it's only gotten worse over the years rather than better. She clearly cares about that, or she wouldn't have argued with people on Twitter about it, trying to get them to understand her.'",
        "In response to 'Yet, they purchase a $2mil compound knowing they donâ€™t have the popularity or alternative income sources to fund this.', a user said: 'I think Kody is relying on the show continuing forever. The only reason they could qualify for this mortgage would have been due to their past two years of tax returns. But actually paying it off for the next two decades is another story. They're both very short sighted.'"
