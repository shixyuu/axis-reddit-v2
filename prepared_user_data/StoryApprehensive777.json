        "In response to 'They have and they're wrong', a user said: 'You legit canâ€™t criticize Saint Simone even a tiny little bit without a cult jumping to scream about her perfection like sheâ€™s anything but a mediocre writer who wrote a few great comics over a decade ago, whoâ€™s really good at manipulating social media.'",
        "In response to 'Woah people like a writer and so they downvote people throwing mindless unbased criticism??? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± Surely this must be the work of manipulation...', a user said: 'Whoa! People donâ€™t like a writer and their opinion has to be mindless? Thanks for proving my point. Yâ€™all flip the fuck out at any critique of Gail. Cultists. And if you love Gail and donâ€™t think she has developed a lot of her rep by playing social media, Iâ€™m really not sure you should call anybody mindless. She seems genuinely proud of how she works social media. And she should be, sheâ€™s very good at it. Much better than at writing comics.'",

It's fine to criticize a writer, but that guy just made things up.\nedit: this guy insulted me by calling me a cultist then got angry at me for insulting him back and blocked me ðŸ˜­ y'all grow a spine before trying to argue on here please', a user said: 'Lol and now name calling. Gailâ€™s truly highbrow fans continue to show their inability to have any kind of perspective.'",
        "In response to 'yeah you called me a cultist why wouldn't I name call you back?', a user said: 'Me calling you a cultist was just stating facts. Bye dear.'",
