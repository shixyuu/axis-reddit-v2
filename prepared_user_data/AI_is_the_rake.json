        "In response to 'Right and to add if you work outside of your listed job requirements you screw every single one of your peers as the expectation of free work will not end with you.', a user said: 'I experienced this when I started a job. Part of my personality is to push myself to my limits. Has nothing to do with work or the company. It’s me vs me as a personal challenge. Instead of getting an “at-a-boy” other developers got a “what are you doing all day!?” 😂'",
        "In response to 'This is such blatant corporate propaganda to leverage public view against labor.  The shortage is from boomers doing a mass retirement during covid and the rest of us have moved up to the available positions.  Unemployment is low, stop sipping corporate kool-aid', a user said: 'Yes. But something stood out to me. Work life balance. I like that idea. I’m going to try it.\nSome individuals kill themselves for their employer. And then the employer expects that level of performance. It’s not sustainable and it’s not fairly compensated.\nI imagine Covid helped people realize it’s not worth selling your soul for a job. A job is a means to an end. It’s not the end. That’s a healthy perspective.'"
