If you are not paid more for your efforts, there is no point in working more.\nThere was a time you'd get increased wages and bonuses by working hard. This does not exist anymore.\nIf someone else is desperate enough to work more for the same pay, well good for him.\nThe reality is that today, workers get wage increases by leaving a company and signing at another, not by working harder in the same company.\nThe longer you spend in  a company, the lower you get paid since wage increases never match inflation, but a new work venue does.\nThe expression \"quiet quitting\" is honestly insulting.  You got a contract, and you are doing what is written on it. If the company expect you to do more work while not paying you more, that is the company's problem, not the contractor.'"
