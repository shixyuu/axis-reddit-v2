No, it's just work-to-rule — and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'It isn’t work to rule either. Work to rule is a form of protest where works do the absolute bare minimum amount of work to keep a company going.\nQuiet quitting as it is being called is just setting healthy boundaries between yourself and your employer. I’ve worked only my contacted hours for past almost 6 years across two jobs, never got a bad evaluation and always meet KPIs.\nUsing your 9-5 effectively should be the focus and not how many hours someone puts in.'"
