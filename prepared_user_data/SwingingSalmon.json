        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I get sick of no matter what happens, it’s not enough. Goals change regardless of your value, you’re always forced to keep going for bigger and bigger deals, etc\nLike I make my office specifically the most gross profit by quite a bit. We also have customer service duties (putting out big fires, the day to day is handled by support teams), and it’s a lot of work to keep the biggest customers happy.\nI have closed big deals, brought in a lot of GP, but it’s always “what’s next what’s next what’s next”, and you just have to wonder… when is it enough? Can you get off my fucking back? No matter what I close they’re expecting 20 down the pipeline. Maybe that means sales isn’t for me but I’m just frustrated that it’s never enough'"
