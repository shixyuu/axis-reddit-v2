        "In response to 'Hi, I didn't put this in the post because it was already so long but this has been a conversation before and I agree there could be better communication. I have directly been told to ask when I need help. However, I have specifically said \"I need help and want you to help. This is me asking you to help me do x.\". This was also not well received, and to be frank I just don't see the value in having to ask for help every single time because even taking time out of doing those tasks is in itself work.', a user said: 'Does he need this type of explicit detailed instruction at work or does he manage to keep track of what needs to be done and does it? If so, he can do the same at home. \nYou shouldn't have to ask him to \"help\", he needs to step up and do his part as a partner!'",
        "In response to 'Yes, he works a job that literally is keeping track of things and problem resolution if those things cannot be tracked and with the instructions it's challenging on one hand if I give him few directions I'm not giving him pertinent information, but if I give him even more directions and offer resources like reading some PDFs I scanned from a puppy training book or etc.  I'm treating him like an idiot and it offends him.', a user said: 'If he cannot grasp that you taking a break means he takes over completely, and he also cannot recognize dog treats, I'd say your treating him appropriately ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nHave you tried telling him to pretend he's at work and figure it out? üòâ\nI'm sorry, that's probably not helpful. But unless he recognizes what his part in a marriage is, quiet quitting sounds like a workable solution. \nI stopped washing my husband's clothes for a while because he \"didn't see\" the mound of laundry. He ran out of underwear a couple of times until his vision improved üòâ'"
