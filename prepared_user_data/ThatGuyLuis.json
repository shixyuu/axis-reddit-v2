        "In response to 'It depends. I service customers for pest control. I make commission on all my stops. 20% usually. While Orkin covers all the overhead. It’s around what I’d make if I ran my own business. As profit. Not revenue of course. Also someone else puts more schedule together for me which makes it very easy. As well as clothes and otherwise are paid for. I write my emails and generally answer the phone until about 8pm if necessary as I have a personal relationship with all my customers and sometimes they have an emergency. Or are just scared and need someone to say it’s gunna be okay. This makes my life much easier during the work day. If you are a tech worker and you are doing service tickets for tech problems after you clock out you are getting fucked', a user said: 'Aha a pest emergency, my boss made a joke about this the other day and how silly it sounds. (I also work in pest control)'",
        "In response to 'Do you remove alligators or rattlesnakes?\nImo, those could be pest emergencies.\nNote: I'm not in pest control, and perhaps I'm wrong that pest control handles this sort of thing.', a user said: 'We don’t do reptiles. I imagine most other pest control places  don’t either.'"
