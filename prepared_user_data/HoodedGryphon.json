She came on time every day, worked on her side hustle at work, and sometimes volunteered to help out whenever anyone complained they were swamped, so everyone thought she was a great coworker. When she retired, they went to replace her and in trying to write up the new job posting realized that she didn’t have any duties. For years. Between having a baby and retiring. She is my role model.', a user said: 'That’s awesome. Did no one ever ask her what she did there?'"
