        "In response to 'I prefer the term \"Act your wage\"', a user said: 'A few of us have pay structures that incentivize caring about the job outside of the normal day and on weekends. Those are the directors and high level management where a significant part of pay is based on performance and it's likely 200k+.\nThen there is my pay structure that's 90% salary and 10% bonus. Thatll get me to answer the phone for a few hours after the normal day to triage but not fix any issues provided it's once or twice a month tops. Weekend work? Nope unless it was planned and I had enough notice to adjust my weekends\\get a comp day. I still won't work more than 40-44 hours on a normal week.\nThen there is salary with no bonus incentives...what reason would you give free labor especially if the salary is under 80k.'"
