We can all play passive aggressive games here.  When they show you the pay, act like they are poor.  Say something like \"oh.... I didn't realize that's all you could afford,\" and \"I didn't realize you were hurting for business that bad.\"  Cuz let's face it, you're obviously not taking the job & they need to be treated like THEY aren't good enough.  If they want what's good enough for them, they're gonna have to pay for it.'"
