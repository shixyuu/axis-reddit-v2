        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Update: wow, the support!  Thank you all!\nWill now only refer to this as \"Just doing my job\"\nStarting today, I quit working for free.  I won't manage the school food pantry, sew for students or school programs ( uniform alterations, letter jackets, CTE jackets, prom dresses), work the gate or track meets, cover hall duty for others, support fundraisers, sponsor or coach teams, provide snacks to students, participate in staff potluck meals.\n I will arrive 2 minutes before my designated duty time and leave 2 minutes after hours.\nI will take off every Friday to help my family, and take off every PD because I have yet to attend a worthwhile PD (I have only been teaching since 2001, a valuable PD is unlikely to occur in the next year).\nI have 80+ days of leave accrued, and I will leave as few on the table as possible. \nThere is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.', a user said: 'I am paid $1000 a year for “prep time”. since my contracted time is 15 minutes before instruction starts and 15 minutes after instruction ends (not enough to actually prep) I arrive an additional 15 minute early and work 10-15 minutes of my 45 minute lunch. I leave right at 3:00 and don’t work at home. I don’t volunteer for any committees. If I do something extra, there will be a stipend attached. My work life balance has never been better.'"
