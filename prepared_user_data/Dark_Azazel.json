You don't own me... ugggh.', a user said: 'The other day my boss brought me into his office and said \"I feel like your part time jobs are effecting your work here.\" And I said \"Ok but that's not really your business.\"  We had a bit of a back and forth before he pretty much told me to quit my other jobs. I flat out said \"Well, they pay me more so.\" That shut him up pretty quickly.'"
