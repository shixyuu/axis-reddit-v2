        "In response to 'Original Post: Taliban Members Fed Up With Office Work, Ready to Quiet Quit [External Link]: https://time.com/6263906/taliban-afghanistan-office-work-quiet-quit/', a user said: '\"Winning is easy, son; governing is harder.\"\nI don't want to say that the Taliban winning outright is in any sense good--but it did cause the organization to face a test that it never had before and it was woefully unprepared to handle. Governing is a much harder task than simply winning the right to govern, and the Taliban having a bit of a \"put up or shut up\" kind of moment here really takes the wind out of its sails. This is why it's so important to allow the winners to govern. Either they rise to the challenge and figure it out, or they prove themselves unfit and are replaced by someone who is.\nThe wrench there is that the Taliban proving itself unfit is way more concerning than other political entities simply being not good at their job. But overall the point that the Taliban probably isn't best defeated by military invasion rings true. Afghanistan is going through a period of metamorphosis and it's messy and horrible, but there's real hope that they are sowing the seeds of success in the future.'",
        "In response to 'I don‚Äôt know how the Taliban is going to balance all the political constituencies of the country, particularly with the large ‚Äúnew urbanite‚Äù demographic. Something like 40% of afghanis are under 15. Large new constituencies formed during that period that are not very excited about Taliban rule on both flanks. Some are extremists even by Taliban standards and are engaged in an insurgency, and some are more modernist and unhappy with Taliban policies, particularly in major cities. There also is the question of non-Pashtun ethnic minorities that enjoyed significantly more equality under the U.S. administration and are unhappy.', a user said: 'Well, they probably won't balance it. They'll lose power and hopefully more democratic traditions will develop organically as more Afghanis fight for political representation and win.\nThat's one possible outcome, anyway. There's lots more. But regardless, I doubt the Taliban will be able to repress their way to success.'",
        "In response to 'The Taliban governed for almost ten years before 9/11. Was that time different than now?', a user said: 'Not like this. They were never the official government of the country, just always a regional power that was only accountable to itself. This is way different.'",
        "In response to 'The Taliban controlled 80 percent of the country in 2001.', a user said: 'Well, last time I checked, 80% is not 100%. And the 20% they didn't control was the \"official\" government.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah, but they're were acting as the de facto government in most of the county. That's my point. They had history performing the role of governing. ü§¶\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan_(1996%E2%80%932001)', a user said: 'Yeah I know, but you asked why it was different. It not being the de jure government and not having complete control of the country makes a difference.'"
