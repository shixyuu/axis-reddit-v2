        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Dude you are already better than the Dashers around here. \nIt doesnt matter that I leave them the building entry code, they just ring me from the apartment carpark. I'm only on the 1st floor, basically a 15m walk through the building entry to my front door.\nThey never bring it to my door.\nThis sort of shit is another reason we, customers, need to be able to tip after the delivery. Can only add a review after delivery here, tip can only be made when you place your order'",
        "In response to 'The day they add the tip after is the day I quit, im not taking every $2 base pay order just to \"hope\" for a tip.', a user said: 'Fair enough too mate. It sounds like doordash are pretty shit to their own workforce.\nJust a question, I don't ever complain about the driver but when I do I'll say the restaurant fucked up my order or gave me the wrong item because I don't want to get the driver in any shit because he or she will probably be delivering my next meal and I don't want them to loose money.\nSo when I complain to Doordash and they give me a partial $8 refund does it come from the drivers pay ? Or from the restaurant? Or do Doordash just take the hit. ?'"
