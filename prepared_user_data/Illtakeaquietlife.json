        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'My company did layoffs and then a re-org so I'm getting a new territory for the SECOND time this year. They're deluded if they think I'm going to start from scratch with a new territory in Sept. I have a golden handcuffs situation until the end of Oct when I get my big commission check. But I'm only going to be putting in the bare minimum till then.'"
