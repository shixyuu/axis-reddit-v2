That was me just sadly raising my hand owning to being a fan.... and now the worst part is they're both in the same conference.... it sucks.\nSidenote: I've seen nebraska paired up with Texas Tech in the 1st round of the tourney a few times. Would be cool! Tho not sure how we match up....'",
        "In response to 'If you have literally anyone on your roster over 6’4” there will be an immediate size mismatch\nWe’re legit just a bunch of point guards masquerading as a basketball team', a user said: 'Interesting. We do have a 6'10 starter and a few guards/towards in the 6'3-6'7 range. But also 3 really small guards that play a ton. Not an athletic looking team but are scrappy. Don't want to turn this into CBB thread, but the advantage you'd have is that we don't see that type of team in the Bigten. Could catch us off guard. Anyways would be cool to see an ole big 12 foe.'"
