        "In response to 'Lol. I mean depending on your job sometimes they are paying you just to be available. Sometimes my work days are slow, in between projects waiting for the higher ups to choose what's next, but I still have to be available to help in case some issues arise. It feels like yea I'm not doing much sometimes but it's just part of the job', a user said: 'Same. I don’t ever tell them of my downtime not because I wanna be lazy but the ebbs and flows are so random if I did, suddenly when they give me more work, my normal projects would come in and have me going from “what do I do” to “oh my god I’m drowning”. I’m usually pretty busy but I work from home and our company does monitor keystrokes or anything, the work gets done and on time so they’re fine, and when they need me I am at my desk ready to pounce on whatever is needed and I don’t let projects ever go outside of asap mode I get everything done. But sometimes I find myself just watching YouTube until the next thing comes in.'"
