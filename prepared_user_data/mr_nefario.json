        "In response to 'Yes, you are, but SFPD also has a point. The DA probably won't prosecute all but the most violent (or notorious) crimes, because the DA knows the judges here will not convict. Indeed, they might not even timely schedule the trial and then force a dismissal of the charges.\nhttps://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/criminal-cases-in-sf-dismissal/3626171\nI'm not a fan of the way SFPD is failing in its mission, but I can understand how demoralized they'd be with endless catch-and-release.\nEDIT: Yes, yes, juries convict and judges sentence, but SF juries and judges alike show a disposition against either.', a user said: 'No, they don’t have a point.\nI\nknow\nthat some VP or Product person is going to scrap 85% of what I work on in a given quarter. They’re going to say “we’re pivoting to meet new customer needs” or “this project has to be flexible to adapt to changes in technology” or some other bullshit.\nI still do my job. I can’t tell my manager “I’m not going to work on X because VP Asshat is going to change his mind in 4 months anyway”. I just do my job, and collect my paycheck.\nI understand that police put their own health and safety in jeopardy, but that’s what they signed up for. Their role in the executive branch of government is fair and equal enforcement of the law.\nIf they want to collect high 6 figures and do fuck all then they should apply for a director role at my company.'"
