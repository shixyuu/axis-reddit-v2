        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'As an outisder, I was under the impression that Japan often hired people for life, but during economic downturns some people would show up to work and be assigned nothing, the 'window people.' Due to the cultural norm of working overtime - and being seen working overtime - simply putting in your hours and going home is being framed here as 'quiet quitting.' That phrase just means something different in the west.\nI guess I'll never know with an article as poorly written and supported as this one. That opening paragraph - where the author just fancifully nicknames different days of the week - isn't even journalism, It's creative writing class time. This is\nbad\nwriting with no analysis'"
