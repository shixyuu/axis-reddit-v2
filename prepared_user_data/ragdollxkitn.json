A lot of Americans have been doing this. I truly act my wage and no more or less.'",

I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'Sounds good. I like your day to day routine. I’m actually quiet quitting right now. Did a lot of work in the AM (4 hours straight) and now I chill.'"
