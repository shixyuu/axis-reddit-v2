The feds ordered it closed in 2020 and threw the CCP out, claiming they were using it as a base for technology theft and spying. Was a big international mess. Google it. The night before they were kicked out, there were huge fires set behind the consulate walls, were probably burning evidence.\n*edit. I'll be a staying at the Hotel Indigo in the Flushing Queens Chinatown in New York City in about two weeks, Chinese spies are welcome to come say hi :)', a user said: 'Burning is standard practice when such a building changes hands.\nPretty much 100% of the time they just burn boring stuff (typical bureaucracy and low-level intelligence) that aren't too important but they can't leave behind.\nIn this particular case I doubt they had too much incriminating stuff on paper in the building as you want to export everything asap, what isn't there can't be found there.'"
