        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'I have 48 years experience as a computer programmer.\nEvery job I've ever had has had \"other duties as assigned\" as part of the job description, and even without me saying anything I've had several bosses point it out when they assigned something far from my normal job duties. They clearly think if I was hired as a computer programmer they can assign me to polish shoes if they want and the labor department won't care because \"other duties as assigned\" covers absolutely everything. I've never called the labor department to ask: when I feel the employer has gotten abusive, I just find something else and leave. (The absolute worst thing I can do to an employer is to deprive them of me and let them find out for themselves how much they relied on me. Several, upon my departure, went out of business or had a major reorg involving the entire manglement team being fired.)'"
