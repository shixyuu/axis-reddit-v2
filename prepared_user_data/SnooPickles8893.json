        "In response to 'If she truly still believes the crap the AUB preach, itâ€™s no wonder she sobs all the time. The heaven you go to is based on how many wives your hubby had. You need a min 3 wives to get your own celestial kingdom. Kody was doing just fine before he met Robyn. He was on his way to his own little slice of heaven. When Christine left, he still had 3 wives and could still have his own place in the stars. Then Janelle and Meri left.  Now thereâ€™s no place in heaven for Robyn - unless she dumps Kody and gets a new hubby, or she finds a few new wives for Kody. We know thatâ€™s not going to happen. So knowing sheâ€™s lost her entire afterlife is the reason sheâ€™s so upset and wants Kody to get on better terms with the ex-wives. She doesnâ€™t want them in her life - she wants their money, and she wants a ticket to a great afterlife.', a user said: 'Meri got a release from the current AUB prophet on the grounds of abandonment. According to his daughter Mel, he would grant a release to Christine or Janelle if they asked for one. There's been some discussion amongst those in the community that this means Kody was judged \"unworthy\" and cannot take more wives in the church, even if Sobyn wanted him to. Her only salvation is to leave him and marry another man in the AUB. I doubt Christine would pursue one, but l wonder if Meri told Janelle how to proceed? ðŸ¤”'",
