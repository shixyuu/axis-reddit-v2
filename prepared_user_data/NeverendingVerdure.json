I handle all the day-to-day logistics and that leaves her free to \"blue sky\" and \"imagine the future.\" In the past I've taken some of those ideas as marching orders, but at some point the actual work has to get done and she isn't contributing to that effort anymore, so I've stopped making extra work for myself just because she makes a comment. Instead I just tell her that it sounds like a great idea and a lot of fun, then don't do the work to make it happen. I definitely don't plan to highlight the \"extras\" we've done in prior years and focus on the work that I did.', a user said: 'Ah.
