        "In response to 'But I'm seeing that police aren't bothering to do their jobs because judges aren't convicting...so seems like it's some sort of endless loop?', a user said: 'Its weird because if these are misdemeanors (which reckless and speed contest are), they're jury trial cases, which means the judge doesn't convict or acquit, the jury does.\nI'm gonna be honest, this level of knowledge should be something any cop more than a year or so should know simply because they have testified in front of a jury.  Which makes me question if these cops are real or imagined.  If they are real, it gives me serious questions about SFPDs knowledge and training by the standards of the average cop.'",
        "In response to 'Oh so the DA is fine prosecuting the Palestine protestors and infringing on everyone's 1st amendment rights, but Madmax style motorcycle roving gangs, nah, yeah those are perfectly fine.', a user said: 'The DA prosecutes the Palestinian protestors because they were actually arrested or cited by the police.  Because that was easy.  They didn't flee on motorcycles.\nThe DA cannot prosecute the dirt bike dudes because they haven't been cited and arrested.  I theorize its because its harder than rounding up a few compliant protestors.  I'm honestly not convinced that chasing these dudes is actually the best idea or even effective.  What would be is monitoring social media and going after the people behind it.  There is almost no attempts to hide identities at all here, you don't need to be the NSA to id them.  But thats more work than just showing up and having mostly compliant protestors who are easy to cite or arrest because they do not flee.'"
