        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet Quitting”, not quite quitting, but forcing employers to adapt. [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: 'Something I've always said is you can pay your babysitter to care for your child but you can't pay them to love the kid. When a workplace expects you to be \"passionate about the product\", or to \"care about the community\", or to be \"excited about changing the world\" what they really mean is they want you to work harder than what you're getting paid to do, work extra hours, work weekends, etc. For those first starting out in any tech or media job, if they say all these things and then try to balance it with free lunches and a foosball table WALK AWAY.'"
