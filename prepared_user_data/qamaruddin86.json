(Big on the news Iâ€™m sure you can figure it out) I had perfect reviews at year end. I had no issues with attendance when we were 3 days. HR currently has zero track record of me not preforming. Anyone do this and how long did it take to finally get the axe?\nEdit: \nI plan on doing basically nothing and using my month of vacation aggressively over the next 8 weeks', a user said: 'Don't love the company love the money. The company never loves the employees. I learned it hard way. I worked 16 hours on average 6 days a week for over 3 years to keep a company running only to be denied a bonus for not responding to a 4am email from the big boss. Do the minimum and prioritize your own wellbeing.'"
