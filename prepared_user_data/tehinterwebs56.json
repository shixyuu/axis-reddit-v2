        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I’m currently in the same job. I’ve realised that the incredible stress I put on myself to ensure work was being done across the team and outside of my team was not worth it for the sacrifice of my family time.\nThe interesting part about this quiet quitting was that once I decided to back away from the chaos, I was actually able to concentrate on the parts of my job I really enjoy, which is my actual job!\nI was doing so much of other people’s jobs that by quiet quitting I was able to actually be super awesome at my actual job and my bosses have been praising my productivity since!\nThe downside is that my equals and people who took my old positions who relied on me for doing a lot of work are now pissed at me but fortunately i work from home so can leave them on read on teams and slack lol.\nWhat I learnt was focusing on your actual job and not trying to fix other peoples problems is always a benefit to you and over all, you’re the only one who really counts when it comes to work. :-)'"
