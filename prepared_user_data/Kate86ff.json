        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I stayed that way for a few years..meanwhile i was using my time at work to study and mind my business...l used all my sickies, etc etc..., then l had to relocate and l am starting a new job on Tuesday. In my old job despite having more experience than my managers I was treated like an idiot so l was doing the minimum for not getting fired..now, in my new job, l will be the manager..when my manager knew about it she sent me a message telling me that I am a great person, an amazing worker with a lot of potential...ffs i blocked her number and deleted her message. Honestly I regret not quitting before.'"
