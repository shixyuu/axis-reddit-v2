The only thing the CBC believes in is that the Liberal Party of Canada should be in charge and they will say or do anything come Election Season to ensure that outcome.', a user said: 'Did you ever consider that all the media supporting conservatives are trash? Rebel. NP. The sun?\nThey look like they support liberal because it makes the most sense. The hot garbage you get from uncle Ezra is not credible.'",
        "In response to 'Woah there sport, that's quite the leap you've made. You're right that Rebel is trash and what Uncle Ezra, as you so lovingly call him, does isn't any sort of journalism that normal, well adjusted folks would recognise. The various Suns are only marginally better. Forgive me for thinking that Right is Right and Wrong is Wrong and the publicly funded broadcaster should be equally skeptical and questioning of the Liberal Party as they are of the Conservatives, who in their current version deserve skepticism and to be given the critical eye.\nI'm not sure how you went from\n\"CBC has an annoying tendency to give the Liberal Party a break\"\nto\n\"I love Ezra Levant and everything he does! Rebel is The Only True News!\"\nHelp me out here.', a user said: 'Yeah, that's fair...\nI stand by initial statement. There's a lot of trash. But I will concede CBC could do better.'"
