        "In response to 'President Elect Donald Trump.\nClearly, it is.', a user said: 'Trump is extremely straightforward.\n99% of what he says is a lie or just wrong. He exaggerates all the time and spouts straight-up nonsense.\nBut he is clear. You ask him something, and he gives you an answer. I find it hard to believe we have to pick between somebody who can not give a straight answer to a hard question, and something that spouts gibberish 80% of the time.\nThere has to be a better candidate.'"
