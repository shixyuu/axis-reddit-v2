I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'If you’re salaried as opposed to hourly more power to you - you’re getting paid for the product, not for the minutes. If you’re hourly and it’s possible to do all the work of a 40 hour workweek in 10 hours, slow the fuck down, because in the company’s eyes, they own you for 40 hours a week, whether that’s doing real, meaningful work or just busybody shit to keep you occupied until you clock out.'"
