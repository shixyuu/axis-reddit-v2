        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Even while in the pandemic, I work based on my pay. My currect job understands this and provides the right amount of workload while paying well to motivate its workers to be happy and productive.\nI've worked a place where they pay you, but the workload is killer or was way \"above my paygrade\". This led me to be rebelous, emotional trainwreck that constantly fought my boss. I eventually stopped taking/pushing back on my boss's requests after getting sick from working too much. I still made my goals and objectives that year (through a pandemic, when eveything was down) and provided evidence of my work and they refused to reward it because I wasn't doing enough work. They thought they could motivate me by getting rid of my pay raise and bonus because I was no longer being their constant whipping boy. That same day, I submitted my notice. They were scrambeling after that: promises were made if I stayed, their stuff would be ruined if I left, threats on ruining my new job. Told them have fun and left. Happy to left that place burning.\nI also worked in places where the workload was manageable or even slow and pays little. This led me to have paranoia over financial issues throughout the day and led me to be lazy and not do work. Eventually, you leave because you either too broke or bored to continue.\nMoney will always talk and after everything we, as a society, has been through, we are sick and tired either not getting the proper pay or workload, so I don't see quiet quitting stopping anytime soon.'"
