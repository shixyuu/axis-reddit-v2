        "In response to 'Shit where I live in Michigan we have one option for internet (well cable, I hate DSL) and it's Comcast. I wanted to get their 100mb data plan but they limited the number of devices I could hook up to my router to 6 so I had to get the 1 gig plan to have unlimited devices connected to my router.\nI don't see how that should be legal, if I want to have 1000 devices on my network using the internet that should in no way impact my ISP. Set a bandwidth max and fuck off.\nEven with the 1 gig speed plan, my total amount of data is capped and once I go over the cap it's something like $10 / X amount of data per month. FUCK COMCAST and internet should be government regulated and treated like any other utility.', a user said: 'Buy your own router, just make sure it is compatible with xfinity/comcast (compatibility info on the routers website) It will pay for itself, then go down to the 100mb plan and just monitor your data usage on their site. Chances are you don't come close to going over your limit and if you do just pay for it from what you saved.'"
