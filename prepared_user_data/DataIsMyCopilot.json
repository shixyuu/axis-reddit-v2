        "In response to '\"quiet quitting\" is 1000% corporate propaganda and shouldnt even be validated with any form of acknowledgement. not a thing, never was a thing, never will be a thing; \"stop trying to make fetch happen.\"', a user said: 'It actually was first a phrase workers were using to describe a\nslowdown\n(not work to rule).\nIt just got taken and rebranded by the corporatists.'",
        "In response to 'Here's where I'm confused, I don't think this is even working to rule- I think it's literally just doing your job. I don't think they're complaining that we're only doing exactly what was given to us in our handbooks and not doing more for similar roles, but rather that fast food workers aren't stepping up in to supervisory roles without additional compensation and related situations.\nThat's not even working to rule, it is just\ndoing your job\nand I find it bizarre how blatant this propaganda is.', a user said: 'It's not work to rule. It's not just doing your job either. Or rather it wasn't.\nOriginally, employees were encouraging others to do the bare minimum for their jobs. You're not quitting (outright) but you're just clocking in, dicking around, and clocking out. Until they catch on and fire you maybe.\nThat\nis what \"quiet quitting\" meant. It was much closer to a work slowdown than work to rule.\nThen the corporate media took it and twisted it to what is now more rightfully being called \"acting your wage.\" But it's still just doing your job and I think we should keep saying that.\n\"Acting your wage\" is also not work to rule because work to rule is specifically using a company's red tape against them and causing a slowdown in a maliciously compliant way.\nI keep seeing these posts and I'm surprised at how few people in this sub in particular do not realize where the QQ term started vs what it is now being made out to be.'",
        "In response to 'I heard on a TikTok that it should be called “acting your wage.” I like both “acting your wage” and “working to rule” better than “quiet quitting.”', a user said: 'It should be called \"doing your job\" imo. Anything else makes it seem like it's some special thing people are doing to \"stick it to the man\" when really people are just setting boundaries and doing what they agreed to for the pay they agreed to.'"
