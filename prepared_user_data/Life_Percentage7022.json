        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I was qq since 2020. Got laid off end of 2024.\nFive years of bludging and a payout from a job I was going to quit soon anyway. Worst part was I used to be a keen bean but nothing I did mattered and eventually I stopped caring. I still reckon I would've been cut even if I had played the game.'"
