        "In response to 'When I first heard the term “quiet quitting” I thought it was something along the lines of “walking off the job and not telling people that you’re not coming back” or “looking and getting a new job and then telling everyone ‘hey surprise, today is my last day!’” I was surprised it was this…let’s say…tame? Or at least, something about the term feels inaccurate for what you’re actually doing.\nAs you said, working your contract is working, not quitting.', a user said: 'I think it also normalizes \"quiet firing\", which is an enormously sh--- thing to do to people.  You know, where they just sort of stop funding your department/program leaving you showing up to work with a handful of people and barely any responsibilities, and wondering if you should buy Christmas presents or wait a couple months.'"
