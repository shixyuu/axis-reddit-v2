You buy twenty desks and twenty desks are delivered. You pay for eight hours of work and if you don't get at least eight and a half hours of work you act like you've been ripped off and the mean workers who are giving you what you paid for are thieving layabouts that are exploiting you.\n(That's \"you\" referring to employers, obviously, not an actual dig at the readers of this comment, unless you are an exploitative employer, in which case why are you here?)'"
