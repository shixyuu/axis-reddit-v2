        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It's not quiet quitting though, is it? As that doesn't even make sense.\nI think it's best described as conscious mediocrity.'"
