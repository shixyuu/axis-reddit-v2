        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I just did it on a 6-week hiking trip. The plan was a 2-week drive through of SD, WY, and Bryce and Zion parks with the wife who doesn’t hike. After dropping her off in Vegas to visit family I had 43 separate hikes planned in AZ, Death Valley, southern Utah, Eastern Utah and then a few nights in TDR backcountry in ND. By the time I hit TDR I was excited as he was one of my favorite Presidents.\nI felt so over five minutes in. After all the UT colors and kick ass hiking I checked out. Did a few more hikes basically sleepwalking through the park. I was so over it I tried a night hike on the last day (3’rd in park) just to try breaking the funk. I think I may have enjoyed much more had there been snow as I hadn’t hiked in it yet that year.\nThe only good thing…I walked past the biggest freaking bison I had ever seen, EVER! What a monster. Glad I didn’t run into him at night!'"
