        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'They don't, I have been asleep at the cart before I woke. They always remind you that even if no one stops, the people passing by got a witness and will still think on the name of Jehovah as a result of us being there.'",
        "In response to 'My friend who’s PIMR (relaxed), was crying the other day about they don’t enjoy being around witnesses anymore. They felt bad about the fact that they don’t enjoy meetings, memorial, assembly.\nThey know that I’m PIMO, about to be POMO. They do just about everything that I do even though they still believe. Maybe it will catch on to them that they’re wasting their life in the org. It’s clear being in the hamster wheel is not doing them any good, but they just need “something to believe in”.', a user said: 'That's just it. Many need something to believe. Other religions will keep you despite small differences in doctrine opinion. They would busy themselves with your career choice. They won't berate you to work free. That is the difference here. I am sure catholic is just as big a scam. But you can be catholic and also be left alone'"
