I’m out here finishing 200 stops in 8–9 hours, and there are people at my DSP knocking out 200 in 4.\nBut every time they rescue me and I don’t hand off the overflow from the totes they grabbed, I end up having to go back to houses they delivered to. And honestly?\nThey never seem to put much care into it.\nI just feel bad leaving packages somewhere that’s out in the open or hard for the customer to get to.\nLow-key… I wish I could move that fast. But not at the cost of doing it half-assed. Guess that just makes me an Amazon soy boy, huh?'"
