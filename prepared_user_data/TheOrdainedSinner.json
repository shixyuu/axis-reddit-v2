        "In response to '\"Quiet quitting\" makes it sound like the worker is acting maliciously by not constantly going above and beyond.\nAnother case of malicious miscategorisation.', a user said: 'In management we broke people down into 3 groups. The ones doing the expected minimum, which was fine. Not everyone wants to climb and the main portion of your work force is going to be average folk earning a wage to go home with. Then you get your high performers(top 10%) and your trash(bottom 10%). This math is for teams I'm used to (60+ employees) and obviously can be entirely wrong by a small efficient team of like 5 people or 12, etc. In that situation you could easily have just 8 average employees, and then 2 hi performers. No real problems.\nQuite quitting almost sounds like what I expect out of an average unskilled worker. Maybe a bit lower if it's intentional as the key is to set metrics at the proper point where you get about ~70% work hours out of a day. Employers who think 100% is realistic are asinine.\nYou have to calculate breaks, fatigue, and so on when setting metrics. Some of these places obviously do not.\nBut I'm still surprised how horrible some employees can be, and how their actions can negatively impact their entire team.'"
