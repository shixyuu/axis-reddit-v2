        "In response to 'its the truth though. also, more woman in the workspace equals higher supply which drives wages down as its more competitive.  Corporations love it, more cheaper, more better.', a user said: 'Paging\n/r/badeconomics\n.\nLabor is conserved here.   A woman whom was previously a house wife can now take her kids to school, do the house work and cooking quicker using modern implements and still commit to a full work day.  Nobody is working less, they just do more using the same hours.\nUsing the argument that increasing the labor pool while demand is held constant as an argument against women employment is ignorant.\nThis assumes the markets for employees across the field stayed constant in size.  We know from elementary economics, increase in the labor pool results in long term economic growth.  Industries often hire new labor cheaper and result in industry growth.  Increased number of employees result in bigger consumer spending and bigger demand from services, which result in even more economic growth.\nWhile there are many economic indicators that show that economic growth does not necessarily imply an increase in wages, there are even more indicators that economic stagnation or decline would result in wages decline and unemployment.  The growth of a formal labor pool is generally good for the economy at large and for those of whom participate in it.\nCorporations didn't love hiring women for much of the 19th and 20th century.  Many of those whom interview candidates today still feel uncomfortable working with women.  Most managers still cringe at the thought of FMLA or providing a spot for breast feeding at work.  I don't really see how 'corporations love it', honestly.'"
