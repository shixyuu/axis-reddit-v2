        "In response to 'Bingo.\nI'm paid for 37.5 and to reach a pre-agreed list of objectives. Anything more than that is sacrificing my time for no extra gain.', a user said: 'There are jobs that when you do more and you’re getting involved in projects, working with more senior ppl, you boost your cv so much, it’s worth to get that and either get chunky pay-rise after 6-12 months, or sometimes even longer,  or change job for 50-100% more on the spot with foot in the door and good prospects for future career.\nNot always possible, but that’s what I did and never regretted going well beyond my tasks just to use my brainpower and get experience I could use in my CV. What I do is purely industry/company \n“know how” so nothing anyone can get anywhere else. Since I don’t have UK degree, all I have is proven track of achievements that carried me all the way up.'",
        "In response to 'but the people who are 'quiet quitting' are probably doing so because their employer has taken the piss first and they likely are not enthused by the idea of going 'above and beyond' to get ahead.', a user said: 'The thing is, young people will swallow the idea without properly assessing their position and apply it anyway. In this case, they’ll waste time by doing bare minimum instead of using it for own growth and not employer benefits. Things you do not always have to be finished or finalised. You can still do bare minimum on the paper, but learn as much as possible everywhere you can.'"
