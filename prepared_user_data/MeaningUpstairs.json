I saw site directors change a total of 8 times, and a 9th AFTER I left. CEO changed 3 times, and I’d say about 6 to 7 managers in various other departments changed at least twice. Employee turnover was ridiculous, I’m talking entire teams switched out like new seasons to power rangers, in all departments. So I started at 12.00 an hour working at a Biomed in a lab of a major biomedical manufacturer. Every time we got a new site lead, new rules, we had to prove to them our worth ect. I left the job making 29.75 or something like this. Way underpaid, for the type of work we were doing.'"
