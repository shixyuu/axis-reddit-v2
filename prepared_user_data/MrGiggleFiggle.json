        "In response to 'It always makes me think of the folks here, 'getting theirs' while there's 'not enough' to go around.\nI have two jobs and am on the hiring/interviewing group for both.\nAt J1, we have\nTWO\nopen positions we cannot fill on my direct team.  We have tried hiring, but cannot find anyone with the skills required that also is willing to RTO.  Management is stubborn and won't open it up to remote even though half the team is remote.\nAt J2, we are hiring remotely. They just announced we took on a couple of new contracts and are hiring two junior SWEs along with promoting two additional folks to management, which will need backfilled.  I work in HR software support, so I also see salaries.  They're trash.  Not surprising we can't even find juniors.\nPersonally I am not taking any job from anyone else.  We just can't find the people we need for what we are paying/asking them to do.', a user said: 'How's the market looking for hiring self taught SWEs? I'm trying to switch careers. I'll even work for free.'"
