        "In response to 'Something I love about doing the One Bag thing of carrying only enough clothes for maybe 3-4 days is that it\nforces\nme to do laundry every 3-4 days. Some find it to be a downside, but for me is a big plus, budgeting a couple lazy hours to find a laundromat, wash, dry, fold, get back to the hotel... it's a great way to slow down and find some sense of normalcy, kind of a zen routine. You mingle with the locals, maybe read a book while you wait, maybe pop into some grocery store nearby and grab a byte, and you don't get that \"I should be using this time to go see that thing\" feeling, bc you're\nknow\nyou're doing something you\nneed\nto do, you don't get a choice.\nAdmittedly, I only take trips on the shorter side of this sub's standards, a week, maybe two, at a time, and it'll probably get old if you have to do it a couple times a week for a month or more, but for\nmy\nneeds, it's a great fit.', a user said: 'Agree with this. One of my favorite places I've ever been was a laundromat/cafe in Krakow.\nWhen I solo travel, usually at least 1 day I lay around and do almost nothing except for go out for dinner and drinks.'"
