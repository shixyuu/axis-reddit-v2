        "In response to 'As a manager I can tell you I've taken a lot of flack for keeping people like your team mate on for a while, so that when first quarter layoffs inevitably come I don't have to let anyone good go. Worry about your own responsibility and let your manager worry about theirs.', a user said: 'Speaking from experience, this!\nI‚Äôve held off on getting rid of people for a bit longer because I knew that Q4 or Q1 were going to ask for reductions and it was better in the long run to term that crappy teammate at that time.\nI had to do it twice in the last calendar year and got called out by members of my team both times and had to behave really professionally until they saw the long game haha. Even my boss has done it.\nAnd if anyone was wondering, no‚Ä¶ terming them earlier doesn‚Äôt mean I just don‚Äôt have to lay off somebody later. You‚Äôd think it would if you don‚Äôt replace them but‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt ever work like that haha.'",
        "In response to 'Had no clue it worked like this. Why 1st and 4th quarters though? I had a coworker who was MIA for hours at a time, every day, never met goals, this went on for months. Then she was finally let go right before conversion from temp to perm. But they kept 2 other slackers on my team, and they've been slacking an additional 6.months now. If what you say is true, I can't wait for 1st quarter', a user said: 'Usually because of budget.\nFrankly, Q4 is hard because they realize that there is nothing left of the year to ‚Äòmake back‚Äô any money. So there are cuts\nQ1 everyone is still bitter about Q4 so they still are anal about money.\nQ2 and Q3 they already forgot about last year or think there is more time to solve it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è'"
