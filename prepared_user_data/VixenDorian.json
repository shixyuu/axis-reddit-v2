        "In response to 'It's a weird sort of power move. The one who cares less in a relationship has the most power. They get off on it.\nMy now ex-husband admitted in marriage counseling that this was part of how he tried to control me in our marriage. (The other part was essentially clinical passive aggression: agreeing to my face whenever I raised a concern, then intentionally doing more of what I had told him bothered or hurt me, as a way for him to feel more powerful.) I immediately dumped his sadistic ass.', a user said: 'Shit like this is why I wish women had a way to leave Yelp reviews about men. The next woman he tries to get with won't know about this shit.\nI'm gonna start asking men for references from the last 5 women they've dated along with details like how long they dated and the reason they broke up. I want to talk to those women and be like, \"Really tho, what's your version of the story? What happened? What'd he do?\"'",
        "In response to 'I did this, too, and when I was met with surprised Pikachu upon breakup, I said, “I told you so many times that I was unhappy.”\nAnd he said..\n“Well, yeah, but I didn’t think you were going to\nbreak up\nwith me.”', a user said: 'They really think we'll just tolerate permanent misery just because.\nLike, no buds. No, women will, in fact, leave you if being with you sucks for us. We don't fear being single. It's better to be alone than with a man who makes you feel alone.'"
