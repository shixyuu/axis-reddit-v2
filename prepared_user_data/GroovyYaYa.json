        "In response to 'This one isn't the annual so it doesn't really count towards anything that could impact pay/raises. If my next one goes like this I will be taking it above him, at that point it will potentially impact my earnings and I refuse to get docked pay when I do so much', a user said: 'Do you get a copy of all of your evaluations, including this one?\nIf you don't - make sure you get them.\nAlso document like you did here in a diary - an explanation that you attach to that last evaluation explaing your side, and date it.  Keep a diary (a CYA diary) of any further interactions you have with the boss going forward.\nThis way if it does impact a pay or raise or more formal evaluation that impacts pay or raises, you don't have to recall something from a year ago - you can just tell them you will refer to your journal entries.'",
        "In response to 'Maybe it's my people pleasing, but I kinda feel like they're busy and I don't want to bother them unless, you know? Maybe I should though', a user said: 'You have a union rep?   YOU NEED TO TELL THEM.\nIt can be like a police report - you don't want to press charges, but you do want to alert them and get it documented.'"
