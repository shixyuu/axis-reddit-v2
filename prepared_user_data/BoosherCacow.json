Because the amount I'm paid is only worth about 4-5 hours of work which I'm already done with.', a user said: 'Because the amount I'm paid is only worth about 4-5 hours of work which I'm already done with.\nYeah but didn't you agree to do the job at that rate when you hired on? I mean this is just weaponized laziness. I was a union rep for 10 years and I kept telling people, you signed up for this. Doing it this way does nothing but hurt you.'",
        "In response to 'And if you got hired at said hardware store four years ago and haven’t seen a raise since then, they’re only paying you for part of the time now.', a user said: 'That's not how it works. Unless you signed on with an assurance of annual raises.\nI get it, I really do. What I am saying is that instead of loafing and losing all credibility in their eyes and the eyes of your coworkers, you have to work to effect change. And I don't just mean their work.\nI mean if you take this approach why the fuck\nwould\nthey give you a raise? I personally couldn't do this even if I didn't feel this way. I couldn't swallow the loss of self respect. Being lazy instead of opening your mouth to ask for a raise is childish.'"
