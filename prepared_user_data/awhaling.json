All anyone wants you to do is your job and literally nothing more. Mind your own business and don't step on anyone's toes.', a user said: 'I work at an older company, not many young people there and many people have worked there over a decade or 2 and I can see why. The culture there is “Stay in your lane. Leave at 5, you can pick up anything you didn’t finish tomorrow, don’t work after hours.” They actually respect work life balance and no bullshit “you need to be a team player!” that is common in many shitty companies.\nSo much better compared to my last job where I got in trouble cause I wasn’t finding things to do on my own when I didn’t even know what else I\ncould\ndo nor did I have the time. Oh and they were trying to implant illegal policies regarding lunch breaks too. My current work was such a breath of fresh air and pay significantly more as well.'"
