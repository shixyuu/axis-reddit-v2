        "In response to 'But if you're doing what's necessary to keep your job, how is that a form of quitting?', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is basically just exploiting the gap between actually meeting the core expectations of the role (I.e. doing your job), versus not meeting those expectations but not so blatantly enough that you quickly attract attention and force your boss to undertake the steps required to fire you.\nArguably quiet quitting is only possible because managers are too busy (or incompetent) and/or the steps required to be undertaken to fire someone are slow or difficult. You see this a lot in government departments where most bosses just cbf going through all the complicated performance management processes so they either retain quiet quitters who have clearly checked out, or find a way to shuffle them onto someone elseâ€™s team.'"
