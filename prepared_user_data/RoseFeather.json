        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I think it’s a stupid term made up by people who want to exploit their workers. Since when is doing exactly what you’re being paid to do a bad thing? It’s not. If you want someone to do more at work than what they were originally hired for, then make those expectations official and increase the pay accordingly.'"
