        "In response to 'I quit from Amazon because I hurt my knee and wanted to ice it, and they told me in the clinic I had to have a manager sign me in. I couldn't find my manager, and so they made me hobble my ass around the fucking factory to find him. Eventually I did, they let me ice my knee, and gave me some Advil. As I was sitting in this room, with a one that hurt way more than it did when it started, I got really pissed and the whole situation. So I clocked out and went home. Fuck that job and fuck Amazon.', a user said: 'Could have called for a paramedic and rung up the employers cost for all this. Then the fireman could have yelled at the nurse for being a dick.'"
