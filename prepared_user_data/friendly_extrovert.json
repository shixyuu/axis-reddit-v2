        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting got me a bonus and a 15% raise I work from home and stopped trying about a year ago. I do monthly closing entries (10 hours of work), but other than that, I hardly do anything. I take my time responding to emails, decline meetings I don't have to join, etc. Since we were acquired and there's been turnover in management, my boss doesn't know what my job involves, and is also weirdly-averse to delegation (workaholic type), so I don't get assigned to anything.  Since I'm just chilling all day with my dog, I'm holding out here until they replace me or until kids come along, maybe in another year.\nWell my boss called me up today to tell me I'm doing a \"great job\". We exceeded targets, so I'm getting 2x my bonus (20k, target was 10k), and a 15% raise (100k to 115k).  Que sera, sera..', a user said: 'Meanwhile in public accounting, I went over budget on a first-year audit and the senior manager was so upset he ended up leaving me a bad review and getting me put on a performance improvement plan. It was a bs plan with no set timeline or deadlines, and I had to deal with it for about 5 months, but they cited that as a reason to give me less of a raise this year.'"
