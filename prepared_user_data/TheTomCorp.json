        "In response to 'Oh I didn’t do this for the company. I was pissed I didn’t get the job, but I realized that the company hired this person because they had a skill set I didn’t have. So that was my goal, to acquire that skill set, and who better to teach me than the person who was just hired for having it.', a user said: 'Sometimes the opposite is true. You have a skillset they don't have. In my opinion it's easier to hire a manager than it is to find senior -insert job role-. You are too valuable in the role your in, promoting you to a manager means they lose you in the job you were doing and now have to backfill. Of course if your valuable to them they need to figure out how to show it.'"
