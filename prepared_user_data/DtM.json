        "In response to 'I started new job at solicitors company. Faster i got and quicker I worked, more work I was given, more mistakes I made and more I got told off. What's a point? Noone apart from this deeply unpleasant and I suspect burnt out girl was working fast or pulling unpaid overtime. So... I slowed down to pace of injured snail. I still get told off purely because they have literally no standard operating procedures and what I get told yesterday is wrong today and both yesterday's and todays will be wrong tomorrow. I am also quite underpaid at least £3000 a year for all that so no motivation to busting my arse for people who don't appreciate it. High staff turnover and etc. haha you pay peanuts you get monkeys....', a user said: 'You’ve completely echoed my thoughts. It’s almost as if you work at my company.\nThe funny thing is, I get told “the company is not making money to warrant pay rises”.\nI work in fund management in the finance sector, our company literally makes money from making money.\nYet I see people who have been on maternity leave for 9 months getting promoted to dept. heads at a 10k per year salary increase and I see people with less experience than myself being taken on for similar roles, starting at 2-3k more than I’m on.\nI guess they think we’re all fucking stupid and we can’t see it blatant as day, but then they also wonder why our department have the highest staff turn over across the business.\nAbsolute morons.'"
