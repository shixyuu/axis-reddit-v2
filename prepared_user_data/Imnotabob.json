        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It's a stupid phrase.\nI'm paid xx.xx per hour for a period of 38 hours in a week to do tasks A, B and C. That's what my contract states, and I do tasks A B and C extremely well.\nIf they want me to perform tasks D, E or F,  or work outside my agreed on 38 hours they'll need to compensate me for that at a rate that reflects my sacrificing personal time or going out of my way to do work I've not agreed to do.'"
