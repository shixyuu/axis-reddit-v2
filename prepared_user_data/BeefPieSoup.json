        "In response to 'I remember when I was getting burnt from work. I started doing the \"bare minimum\" doing exactly what my responsibilities and nothing more, timing everything so it'd take the whole day, same reaction. Was very weird, Ive been using that strategy for years now and... it works?', a user said: 'As a boss, whose ass are you gonna ride:\nA) guy who clearly does not give a fuck and can't be made to give a fuck\nB) sweaty, panicky noobie who is desperate to go \"above and beyond\" to impress the boss and \"do whatever it takes\" to get ahead, and makes that crystal clear at every opportunity?\nEnd of the day, (B) is a fuckload easier to bend over and assfuck into overworked oblivion. (B) is also never gonna get promoted to another department or a higher position unless it becomes absolutely unavoidable.'"
