You guarantee that you’ll get the current market rate for your job and that your wages won’t stagnate. Take everything you can from your job: information, skills, supplies, certifications and training, and most importantly connections. Leverage those connections when you need them most, but maintain contact. Your boss’s company won’t hesitate to screw you over, so you have to “pump and dump” each company you work for. It’s not in anyone’s best interest to create long-lasting performance/meaningful change.', a user said: 'Realistically it depends on the company. Yeah, plenty of companies don’t give a shit about you and only see you as a number, but there are also good companies. I’ve been at my current company for about a year, and I put in the effort to go a bit above and learn some things that weren’t necessarily expected of me and did some stuff that wasn’t in the base job description. And wouldn’t you know it, after just 11 months I got a promotion with a $10k/year raise. I don’t have any plans to leave the company, certainly not anytime soon, because I genuinely feel it’s a good place to work and I like what I do, and I also feel like my bosses genuinely care about my success.'",
        "In response to 'How does this old fart expect anyone to work longer than the time they get paid? If the schedule is 9-5 then you work from 9-5 and leave asap. Not even working at 5:01 anymore', a user said: 'I usually stop working before my scheduled end time because it takes me a few minutes to walk to the punch out terminal.'"
