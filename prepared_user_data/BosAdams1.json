        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'You’re traveling wrong 👀☠️ I learned early that I hate museums + feel like I’ll catch fire in a church. The only place I feel you have to over schedule travel is the USA due to its size. Every other continent and region I’ve been to…I can up and go the day I decide is a good one to move along. Flights, trains, hotels/hostels all so easily accessible compared to home - at relatively low cost. I travel for 2-3wk increments at this point. I take up residence in a new place + create my routine. When I feel I’m settled enough and have fallen in love with the city or area (usually 4-5 days for major cities, 2-4 for mid sized places) I’ll up and explore another new home base. But dear god, I have friends who complain about this type of travel all the time and it makes me grateful I set my own itinerary - if friends want to travel with me…they know my methodology and if they don’t like it, they can optimize their travel to their wants without me 🤷🏻‍♀️'"
