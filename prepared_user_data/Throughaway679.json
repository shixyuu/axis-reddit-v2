        "In response to 'What scares me the most is how early we still are in this administration. I can't even imagine how much worse it's going to get.', a user said: 'Even if the office is spared a bit, people are going to reach a breaking point.\nPlenty of SPEs are already at retirement age and can see them giving in even though they probably weren't planning to retire soon. Morale is low and nothing they can really do.\nSome one will have to pick up their work and If the hiring starts and things don't change going to be a bigger burden on SPEs. Things are not going to get any better for them and more than 3 years, only going to get worse and worse.\nFirst phase of RIF is paused so we still haven't seen the full impact. There is a 2nd phase that involved reorganizing areas of the office.\nHiring and the end of paying for those people who took Fork, maybe things settle down a bit and next FY they will allow some other time again but not going to be the same.'"
