        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" [External Link]: https://v.redd.it/djteeyf02fk91', a user said: 'I had a job at a makeup store and I was constantly going above and beyond. I would handle my area of the store and during the downtimes I would be facing products, restocking, assisting people outside of my area and they really had the NERVE to call me into the office and chastise me for not being in my area at all times. So it’s okay when y’all are short staffed that I service the whole store but not when it’s slow? You want the store to look like crap? And the real gag is that one of the lower managers who was thanking me for all of the extra work I was doing was present when the GM was telling me shit and AGREEING with him. I started looking for a new job the same day and when the pandemic hit and they decided they couldn’t pay us anymore, I quit right after that meeting cause I had gotten hired somewhere else. I will never go above and beyond ever again. I am here for a check. I don’t care about the culture and I don’t care about helping y’all.'"
