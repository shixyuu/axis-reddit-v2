        "In response to 'If someone isn't fulfilling their duties then there's already terminology for that, like underperforming etc. \"Quiet quitting\" is a derogatory term that's recently made it into workforce vernacular that's aimed at shaming people who do their jobs and don't go beyond that, by people who are attempting (apparently succesfully) to get their workforce to think going above and beyond their pay grade is standard.\nIf, in the scenario you describe, someone is failing to perform their duties then \"quiet quitting\" doesn't apply, because they're not actually doing the job they are paid to do.', a user said: 'aimed at shaming people who do their jobs and don't go beyond that, by people who are attempting (apparently succesfully) to get their workforce to think going above and beyond their pay grade is standard.\nI got a promotion this year by effectively going above and beyond, and proving to my supervisor that I was ready for a new position. It came with a pretty nice raise, too. Obviously, going \"above and beyond\" is a bit subjective. The way I would describe it is that I took on additional responsibilities and did my best to work through things and make decisions on my own. I didn't come in on weekends, or any crap like that.\nMaybe it isn't \"standard\", but if you want to advance, that is part of it. I just don't think there is anything inherently wrong with putting forth extra effort in hopes that it will eventually turn into something worthwhile.'"
