        "In response to 'Tech is 100% this.  Get one senior lead dev, who has no life and works until 1am everyday, and pair him with 5 juniors with under 3 years experience, you have an all star team.  They will outperform a group of 10+ mid developers.  Every. single. time.\nCompanies really don't like this though because that one dev has so much power, and if they take their ball and go home, it can absolutely wreck an entire department.  My company has really been pushing this \"swarm\" mentality.  Where they don't want leads or anything anymore.  They want tasks to just be worked on simultaneously by all so that knowledge is always shared so there is never a knowledge gap because they are absolutely terrified of the lead dev power dynamic.  Every task is a paired task.  It's terrible and simple tasks take entire weeks.', a user said: 'This is so similar to the bus factor in projects.'"
