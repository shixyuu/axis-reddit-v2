Still love that EY acts like they only did performance cuts during 2008 and never laid anyone off'",
        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is a hilariously stupid phrase that I love because it implies that people have an obligation to work more than they are paid - which they don’t .\nPer Wikipedia:\n“Quiet quitting is an application of work-to-rule, in which employees work within defined work hours and engage solely in activities within those hours. “\n… the fuck do employers think a job is?', a user said: 'Yeah, quiet quitting isn’t what OP thinks it is. It’s employees that don’t let the company become their sole social group and bend over backwards to help off-hours without pay.\nA good example is when new entry level employees are expected to do recruiting events at colleges without pay and maybe some “swag” (a fucking water bottle) as payment'"
