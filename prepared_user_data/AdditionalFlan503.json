        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I stopped giving a shit and apparently made myself more valuable.  I detached from knock down drag out arguments and started being seen as the cool as a cucumber stalwart when I literally said or did nothing to advance things.\nI applied for a job that I thought was way beyond me, using the same attitude during the whole selection process - I answered questions brutally honestly, again with nearly reckless detachment.  My pay jumped 60% in that move.\nI didn't really quiet-quit, I took my hours from 60hrs per week to 40, worked reasonably consistently.   I stopped reacting to any external demand for schedule change - you want that thing tomorrow? I want a lot of things too, we are both out of luck.'"
