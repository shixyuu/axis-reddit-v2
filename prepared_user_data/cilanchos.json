        "In response to 'I think this “hard work” they engaged in was a myth.  They tell it to make themselves sound better.\nThose “glory days” were glory days because some things were EASY for them, they were handed to them.\nThey say they pounded the pavement, walked boldly into places asking for work. That was because you COULD do that.  Graduate high school with no skills, just walk down the street and easily get hired at the local factory.  And you’d get a decent job for good pay at a place that would be loyal to you, and you could raise a family.\nThey assume because they got those things, they MUST have worked hard to get them, right?\nAnd that attitude of working “above and beyond?”  That’s bogus too.  There was massive growth then.  You’d work a while, and someone needed to be a manager, so the guy who had been there longest was promoted.  Then the next guy, then the next.  They didn’t “burn the midnight oil,” they just stayed at the company that was happy to have them, and got promoted when it was their turn.\nThey (white males at least) were born into an unprecedented time where things for them were EASY and everything was just handed to them on a silver platter.  Then they invented the myth that all that easy stuff wasn’t easy, it was their hard work that got them where they were, and that means that the world today is lazy and soft because they can’t easily get the same things.', a user said: 'And don’t forget they had someone cooking their meals and washing their clothes and making sure the kids were in bed when they got home from work. Their world was very different.'"
