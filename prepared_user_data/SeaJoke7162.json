        "In response to 'I’m stuck in my career (not much of one) and have thought about an MBA to help expand my long term earnings opportunities but each time I talk to MBA grads, I usually walk away unimpressed and confused why I should go into debt for an MBA.', a user said: 'From my perspective, don’t do it.  Wife and I sacrificed a lot to get her MBA back when our kids were little.  OMG what a wasted piece of trash expensive piece of paper that employers don’t value.\nShe actually had to rake it OFF her resume as managers were either intimidated by her degree or thought she was “overqualified”…\nThe job she has now she landed by taking MBA off her resume.  It’s an okay job, but you would expect more income with an MBA I guess.'"
