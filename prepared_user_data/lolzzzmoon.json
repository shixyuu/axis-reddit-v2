        "In response to 'This is exactly what I do on longer trips. So many itineraries I see on here are people moving to a new city or country every three days, and that would totally burn me out. I’ll usually pick a few places where I stay for a couple weeks (sometimes a month or two), and then add the quick city breaks between those longer stays. Some people put a lot of pressure on themselves to see everything, and I understand some people have limited time, but I love getting to know a new place, relaxing, exploring at a leisurely pace.', a user said: 'Agreed. I now choose to miss out on a few things so I can actually enjoy myself. I don’t enjoy hectic traveling.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'My key plan is to build in quiet solo times to read, chill, nap, sleep in. Then I don’t get burnt out on going hard the whole trip.'"
