        "In response to 'Work ethic?\nI spent 5 years living in Japan, and from what I saw in the white collar industry a lot of that ‘worth ethic’ is face time.\nWhy were all the workers taking random naps at their desk during the day instead of just getting a good nights sleep? Because it wasn’t socially acceptable to leave the office until their boss had left, and he didn’t leave until 9.  Then they all had an hour commute home. These were not super productive people. They were worn out for no good reason. There is no work life balance.\nYou’d occasionally have someone who dared have a hobby or a work life balance, you could easily point them out because they were well rested and happy. They were also social and workplace outcasts.\nA lot of Japans social issues would be eased by a better work / life balance. For that to happen it would mean a massive top down social change.', a user said: 'I remember reading that Microsoft Japan experimented with a 4 day work week and saw a huge boost in productivity since they had to cut out a lot of the time wasted on meaningless things'"
