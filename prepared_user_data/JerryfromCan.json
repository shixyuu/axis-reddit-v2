        "In response to 'This happened when a former coworker of mine left. She'd been working nights & weekends for years, not taking vaca, etc. The organization just kept giving her more & more work. She'd tried to explain that deadlines were only being met at the expense of her health. They literally told her to \"work smarter, not harder\".\nHaving gotten nothing better than a useless platitude in response, she left not long after. They literally replaced her with 3 people.', a user said: 'I was this guy, sort of.  I only ever put in my 44 hours (employer was shit and I could work that before they had to pay me OT).  Whatever work they threw at me I just did it.  But I was smart and lazy.  Need all this data analyzed monthly?  Lemme just automate it in excel.  That was 90% of my job.  My boss thought I did nothing so would never give me a raise.\nI quit for somewhere better, and trained THREE people to do my job.  None of them could remotely understand what I was even doing with the scripts, nor how to troubleshoot them when they broke (which they did, I wrote shit code then and now as security).\nWas told after I was gone 1 of the 3 quit and they replaced her with 2 more.  So now 4 people doing my job that I was underpaid for, and they went back to analyzing everything manually in excel.  I made $27k/year and asked for $30k.'"
