I was laid off 4 times in 2 years from 08-10.', a user said: 'Dude Gen-x had it worse than ANY of these generations. I graduated in '94 right when NAFTA was passed and globalization was taking off, factories shutting down left and right. What good ones were left, were taken largely by boomers who were still in their prime working years.And by the time those boomers started retiring it was 2008 and the GFC.'",

Then it all came crashing down with NAFTA and the rise of Asian mfg.', a user said: 'I'm outside of  Cleveland area, so I feel your pain. I forgot to mention temp services. They started to take off right as we graduated. I was laid off 3x( three different plant closings) from '02-'06, the last one I was on unemployment until spring of '07, then a year later, the economy crashed. There was a TON of factory closings near me from 2000-2010, all good paying'"
