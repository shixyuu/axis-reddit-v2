        "In response to 'Oh you know, just a HUNCH, lol.\nI've worked in maintenance and engineering support. Maintenance crew comes up and tells me \"Machines A, B, and C need to be repaired\", and I put it on my list of equipment to inspect after asking the level of criticalness each repair was. The next day I inspect each machine myself to determine the amount of work to be done to get it up and running, put together the price for the repairs, and estimate the pricing.\nThen I present the information and get ignored for 6 months. Then I get called on a Saturday afternoon because \"machines are down and we have critical deadlines\", in which my response was always \"Per my emails the last 6 months: you didn't think these repairs were necessary, so I will see you Monday\".', a user said: 'It’s funny to hear the exact same scenarios play out in completely different fields. When my boss hired me he mentioned a large dvd archiving process for the thousands and thousands of data discs the company has going back 12 years. These are not organized at all and yet need to be accessed regularly.\nI researched some products and gave a very cost effective solution that would involve a total cost less than my boss pays me per week, to get it started at least (would require a low skilled employee to work full-time on the project for about a month or 2). He’s “agreed” three different times and nothing happens. And then of course like right now when we’re busy, tons of these requests are coming in and we don’t have spare personnel to locate these discs so they’re just being pushed aside.'"
