        "In response to 'I was in this situation with my previous job (I was in management at a Seattle-based coffee company). My store was the busiest non-drive thru in my district. Customers would always complain about how dirty the store was, about wait times, angry/grumpy employees, etc…I remember a Teams meeting where another SM (store manager) was venting to our DM (district manager) over how overworked and stressed their employees are, and many of them have two jobs because they don’t make enough working 30+ hours at this job. That SM said “they’re giving their 110%” to which the DM replied “then that’s not good enough!”\nA few months later, the DM visits my store during the morning rush. DM puts themself on the floor doing a super easy role (“warming” wherein you put the food in an oven and wait for it to warm up to then serve to the customer. This is done for pastries and sandwiches). The DM’s usual ostentatiously chipper attitude dropped within around 5 min of working, and after about 10 the DM actually yelled at a customer who was complaining about the wait time for food that the DM was working on. DM can’t even do for 10 min what they expect us to do for 5+ hours a day with 75% less pay.\nTo top this, customers always provide their feedback via the app (if they use the app to pay). The responses are nearly universal in “wait times are too long,” “too few employees,” “this store is too busy for how few people there are,” “dirtiest store I’ve ever seen,” etc…of course the DM doesn’t see this as an issue of being understaffed, rather that the staff are lazy and not following the proper routines.\nSuffice to say I found employment elsewhere.', a user said: 'Way back in the 1900's, my first tech job. Management/HR was angry at how long our calls were taking. So they decided to setup a listening station for them to randomly connect to our calls and listen to what was taking so much time.\nThey admitted to only being able to listen for about 5 minutes because of how detailed/involved everything is, and how boring it was. Management being brought in from outside with zero understanding of what goes into the job tends to hamstring any department in any industry. How things work on paper; how things \"should,\" work? Fall apart as soon as your average human customer gets involved, and that's when it all goes to hell, rapidly.'",
        "In response to 'Exactly. They design routines, systems, and time out tasks based on what’s theoretically possible in an ideal situation, plus maybe 5% extra time if something unexpected happens. What they account for is, well, the public. Someone broke a glass jar in the middle of the aisle, someone is shouting profanity and threatening violence in the middle of the store, an old person is taking 10 minutes to order at the register, a young child is grabbing things off the shelf and leaving them god-knows-where….yeah that’s not being accounted for.', a user said: 'To compound that exact point - \"Someone broke a glass jar in the middle of the aisle.\"\nThe routine should be \"Employee X goes into the aisle with the correct equipment to handle said glass and contents.\" But when in reality it's \"customer reported something on the floor,\" with zero indication of what's really happening, someone has to go, check it out, verify, then either contact someone else to get the equipment, or go back and get it themselves, and then get to work, assuming *another* customer isn't getting in the way the entire time.\nYeah. It's super frustrating.'"
