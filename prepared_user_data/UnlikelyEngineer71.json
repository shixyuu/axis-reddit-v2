        "In response to 'Low key truth. Her whole brand is doing the absolute minimum while maximizing personal gain. She basically perfected strategic laziness as a lifestyle.', a user said: 'Actually it’s very shocking that Kody always said Christine needed to put more effort into their marriage. Christine had 6 children, watched ALL the OG children so Meri and Janelle could work, and still had part time jobs. Robyn had her kids doing the MSWC shipping, never worked, always had Nannie’s… what to hell does she do besides keeping Kody sexually satisfied? \nRobyn was able to treat Kody like her best customer because all the hard work of being a mom was being done by others. I’m sure Christine could have been better in the sack too if she hadn’t just watched 13 kids, cooked and cleaned.'",
        "In response to 'She’s not covered, though. In their cult, Kody would no longer be considered a “worthy priesthood holder,” so if she truly believes, he wouldn’t be considered eligible bring her through the veil into the Celestial Kingdom.', a user said: 'If she truly still believes the crap the AUB preach, it’s no wonder she sobs all the time. The heaven you go to is based on how many wives your hubby had. You need a min 3 wives to get your own celestial kingdom. Kody was doing just fine before he met Robyn. He was on his way to his own little slice of heaven. When Christine left, he still had 3 wives and could still have his own place in the stars. Then Janelle and Meri left.  Now there’s no place in heaven for Robyn - unless she dumps Kody and gets a new hubby, or she finds a few new wives for Kody. We know that’s not going to happen. So knowing she’s lost her entire afterlife is the reason she’s so upset and wants Kody to get on better terms with the ex-wives. She doesn’t want them in her life - she wants their money, and she wants a ticket to a great afterlife.'"
