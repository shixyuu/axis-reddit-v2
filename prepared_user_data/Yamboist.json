[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is such a corpo bs term. When you buy 1kg of rice, you pay 1kg peso worth of money. If the vendor decides to give you extra kg, then that's called a promo. Now when employees give services for what they're paid for, they call it quiet quitting?\nEh, just call it \"quielty doing your job\". Any extra is just a promo and should not be expected as a norm.'"
