        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: 'So glad you’re feeling better! I’m curious if you think the perception of you at work has changed. If so, how? I’m wondering if you’re getting feedback either that you seem happier/more capable, or that you seem like you’ve check out.'",
        "In response to 'The little things at work that used to bother me honestly don't anymore,  especially since I know I literally don't get paid enough to care. Also it's afforded me the energy I need to further my skill set outside of work(coding)', a user said: 'That's great! Good for you. I hope you're able to keep it up!'"
