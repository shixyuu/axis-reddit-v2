I did not get a reply.\n“I finally accept that all my hard work will only ever be \"rewarded\" with more work and punishment when I can not achieve it. I consistently do the work of more than two people and instead of being awarded (or even praised), I get punished when I start to faltering under the workload being dumped on me. I will never go \"above and beyond\" again. I will never work unpaid time again. I will never skip breaks again. I will never miss another vacation again. I will not permit myself to be taken advantage of ever again.”'"
