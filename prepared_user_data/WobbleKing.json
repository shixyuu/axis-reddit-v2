        "In response to 'Think 2008-2012 millennials. You just graduated, but the economy is in a slump and no one is hiring. But on top of that you also have a shit ton of old people.\nChina letting Evergrande declare bankruptcy is huge. Things must be really bad to let a state capitalist agency go under with all the saving face culture they have. Their covid rules really shot them in the dick. They centered their economy around foreign investment and cheap exports but 3 years of no economic activity made those foreign partners go elsewhere for a reliable partner. Also china is way more educated than it used to be so people demand more money and it’s suddenly not cheap labor at all. China wants a blossoming service economy but they are China so understandably no one trusts them with banking and besides the West already has established places to do that', a user said: 'It’s much worse if OPs numbers are correct the Great Recession was only 10.6% unemployment at its peak'"
