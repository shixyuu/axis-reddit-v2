        "In response to '100% this.', a user said: 'In a year, five years, people wonâ€™t even remember much of their co-workers, unless they were really close or became a good friend, but they rarely forget a narrow minded boss!\nBut, I guess it is a good lesson to learnâ€¦you never know who is eavesdropping, so always be careful what you say, especially in a one sided conversation. Big boss assumed a lot, so we all know what that makes out of him! Does he really think people would approach him with questions, with his attitude?\nLooks like OP became the scapegoat. I bet Boss has heard a lot of undertone grumbling. Or OP was too popular with the staff and he felt neglectedâ€¦did he get a hand-made Valentine card? ðŸ¤­'"
