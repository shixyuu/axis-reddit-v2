        "In response to 'I work in a union shop, and when my supervisors piss me off I do\nexactly\nwhat I'm told. . . . . . . And\nONLY\nwhat I'm told.\nWorking as instructed still means you need to be instructed.\nI also regularly admonish new hires for working off the clock. They don't start paying us until exactly start time, so if you come in early, even if you punch in, they don't pay you until you were scheduled to start.\nI think this is a stupid rule, so when I get there early I sit on the conveyor belt that is required for work to happen and play on my phone. They can't turn the belt on if someone is on it, so if they want to start working they have to ask me to move.', a user said: 'I like to put it this way. If workers give enough free labor to add up to enough time to equal another position, they just cost someone a job. That could be one more employee there helping everyone out.\nIf there's more work to be done than people, don't bust your ass and do it for free. Let them feel the pain of things not getting done and they have no choice to bring someone on the help. Don't let the bosses make THEIR problem YOUR problem.'"
