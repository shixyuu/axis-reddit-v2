        "In response to 'Original Post: \"Quiet Quitting\" is a bullshit gaslighting term. Don't let it become an acceptable term [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/fwj0foce59k91.jpg', a user said: 'I,as a unionist,only use work to rule when the union needs to get a point across.   It’s a real eye opener when we use it. Usually about a week and a half before the big guy goes on vacation. He can’t go when there’s labour unrest. He missed his vacation one year. Ever since he tries to keep it a secret when he’s going. Every year we wish him happy holidays a couple days before he’s going. Just to let him know we are approving his time off. Time off is a two way street. As he found out. He plays nice now.'"
