It always reminds me of the one time I quit my shitty job at the time to go to trade school. I didn't do anything nearly this extravagant, but I did manage to fuck over my boss and her whole week, and ruin her reputation with the owners.'",
        "In response to 'I've managed quite a few people and currently teach apprentice electricians, and I've told all of them that quitting by no-call-no-showing or ghosting does exactly as much damage to your rep with your boss as going out in a blaze of glory, so you might as well hire a band and do it right.', a user said: 'As an electrician, I've seen it. Companies will screw you over, and I've seen an employer ruin a young apprentices reputation in a fantastic area for the trades. To be fair, the kid was an idiot and had it coming, but not to that extreme extent.\nI once went out in a quiet blaze of glory over a dispute over not getting paid my bonus for working on a federal holiday, as was stated and agreed upon in my contract. I went to work with a friend and quit quietly, while reporting them to the department of labor. That company doesn't exist anymore, and last I heard was that the owner went to jail years ago for fraud and drug charges, amongst some other charges that showed he wasn't kidding when he told me he grew up in a trailer park in Florida.'"
