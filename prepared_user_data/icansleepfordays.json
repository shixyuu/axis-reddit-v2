Left for a year, came back to the same company and got a 50% increase on what I was making.

Then the GFC happened.\nAbsolutely refute this notion that older millennials had it easier.', a user said: 'Hey that's me! I graduated college in 2004. Managed to find a job. Laid off in 2009. Went back to school in 2010 because I couldn't find a job. Graduated with masters in 2013. Found a job. But because of the timing, I couldn't buy into the market in 2008 which all of the houses would have paid for it self 3x by now. Not to mention the lost years of working experience, student loan debt, etc, etc.'"
