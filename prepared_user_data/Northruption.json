        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'Having these thoughts every day. The only thing that will get me to prospect and cold call is 200MG of caffeine.\nI wonder what's getting me down because I've only been in an SDR role for a year over two companies. Glad to know that there are others feeling the same way.\nOne of the things I think is that my first role had a boss who loved volume but it didn't work well, we saw very little success and the company went under.\nit's unmotivating to not feel success for over a year. Did I book meetings? Yes. Did I hit the quota? Yes. Did our sales org fail ultimately? Yes.\nI think to me the channels that we engage over like phone, email, etc are just boring as hell. IDK about you but I have 15,000 emails 100+ texts, and many other messages just completely unread.\nto me, it's so unengaging and the only thing keeping me is the base salary. I'll ride it out while I sleep in until noon and go to meetings.'"
