        "In response to 'I’m in a pipeline for a promotion to a salaried management position at the moment. They expect these guys to work 52 hours a week minimum. There is no OT and if it your day off and they call you, you are expected to answer. The only thing that makes this slightly worth it is if you get a bonus it’s like 20k but if you don’t than fuck that. I’d already be in that position if they got OT.', a user said: 'At 50 weeks of 52 hours, a onetime 20k bonus is about 7.70 an hour. That's decent, but not absolutely amazing.'"
