If your company cannot survive without overworked gunners then it does not deserve to survive.', a user said: '“Quiet quitting” is just management being shitty they’re getting the same treatment they’ve been giving their employees.'",
        "In response to '“Quiet quitting”\ncalling it that just shifts the blame to the worker, if we called it \"Working as hard as you are rewarded\" suddenly everyone would realize where the blame is.', a user said: 'Yup. I find it funny the definition is “not doing more than required”. So evidently “quitting” is now defined as doing your job. F anyone who seriously thinks people being fed up with being exploited is a bad thing.'"
