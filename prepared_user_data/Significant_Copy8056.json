        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'I think when you work long enough and see that those who work longer hours, do more tasks at the job, and basically seem to be on top of everything, make about the same pay increase as those who just punch a time clock, you see that it's not really worth it. However, most people don't realize what they give up while working beyond expectations. Health, family time, personal time, etc. You don't realize it until after the fact, and you can't get that time back.\nHowever, the values that were instilled back about 30 years and further used to yield a desirable result. An education, a good paying job, a home, a pension. Now even with those same values being taught to college aged kids, they are discovering that those end goals are almost unattainable. Hence, quiet quitting. Many of us probably felt like things were screwed up, but kept pushing on. Kids today, know it's fucked up and what's the point. I'm with the kids on this one.'"
