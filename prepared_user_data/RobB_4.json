        "In response to 'I was a zombie for a few years there, barely participating... to the point where I just couldn't motivate myself to do even essential work... but then my wife died and everything changed.  The people at my work were\nfantastic\n... other people picked up my workload in a second and without and complaining, I got cards and flowers and regular contact from literally everyone... and for her funeral everyone came including some of the Board Members and even a few of our customers.\nOn top of that I had a few months off and they paid me the whole time even though I had like four days leave accrued.\nI feel like their people I should work hard to support in return.', a user said: 'Their response, and yours, is so good to hear on every level. Very sorry for your loss though.'"
