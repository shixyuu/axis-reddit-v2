It's been coopted by business owners and made appearances in op-eds in publications like Forbes and WSJ blaming workers for problems that are a direct result of corporate actions.\nThe short answer is that quiet quitting is when workers do exactly what's required of them but stop going above and beyond for various reasons. It's usually a combination of burnout, overwork, underpayment in the face of massive inflation, or mediocre to absent raises while companies report record profits and executive bonuses.'"
