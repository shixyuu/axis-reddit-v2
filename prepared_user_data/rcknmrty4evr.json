        "In response to '9 years is a long time for that little of a pay bump. Most time you have to leave to get better pay.', a user said: 'That’s what my husband does, he gets a new job about every 2-3ish years to get a proper “raise”. After doing this a couple times, he’s now starting at his new job making 20k more than he did before, at a company with\nactual\nopportunity for advancement, and this new company and title look really good on his resume. If he just stayed at his old job from years ago hoping they’d reward his loyalty, he’d be making significantly less than he does now. He also applies for positions even if he doesn’t meet every qualification figuring it would be good interview practice regardless, it’s actually how he got his current one.'"
