Companies love people who work really hard to try and become irreplaceable. But a company will only put in minimal effort to keep the employees they already got. So I reciprocate by putting in minimal effort to keep the job I already got. It all evens out! Work still gets done! I have no expectations from my job because I know I will quit in 3 or 4 years to get a pay bump.'"
