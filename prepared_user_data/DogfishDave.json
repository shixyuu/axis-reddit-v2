        "In response to 'If you are doing the minimum required to do your job you are, by definition, doing your job. Seems like common sense to me - why sign a contract to do X then do X + Y?', a user said: 'If you are doing the minimum required to do your job you are, by definition, doing your job.\nThis.\nWhen people do this it's invariably painted as negative, but in fact it's completely fair and the right thing to do.\nIf you went into your employer's shop and bought £10 worth of their finest [product name], and took another £2-worth because you actually needed a little more... you'd be a thief.\nWhen you only do £10 of work for them rather than £12-worth (because this needs finishing for a client), it's called \"\nWorking to Rule\n\", or the new \"\nQuiet Quitting\n\".\nAnd there's something insidious, horrible, and old-time British Working Class about it. Aren't you grateful, ya buggers!?'"
