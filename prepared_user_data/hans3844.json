        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'It's called working to contract and has been a thing for a long time. I have been trying my hardest to do this in my job because too many in my industry are taken advantage of and I'm sick of it. I am really speedy so I often would get a lot of extra work but no more! I'm done. I will do my job and then chill the rest of the day period. If they can make me work over 40 hr when it's crunch time I'm allowed to work less if it's slow.'"
