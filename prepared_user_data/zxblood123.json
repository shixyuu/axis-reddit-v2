        "In response to 'I stopped giving a shit and apparently made myself more valuable.  I detached from knock down drag out arguments and started being seen as the cool as a cucumber stalwart when I literally said or did nothing to advance things.\nI applied for a job that I thought was way beyond me, using the same attitude during the whole selection process - I answered questions brutally honestly, again with nearly reckless detachment.  My pay jumped 60% in that move.\nI didn't really quiet-quit, I took my hours from 60hrs per week to 40, worked reasonably consistently.   I stopped reacting to any external demand for schedule change - you want that thing tomorrow? I want a lot of things too, we are both out of luck.', a user said: 'Fuckijg legend haahah'",
        "In response to 'I worked for a bedding manufacturer for 21 years. I don't drive, and during that time they moved premises twice. Both times further from my place of residence. After the 2nd move it was taking me 4.5 hrs each way to get to and from work via public transport.\nI managed to stick it out for 12 months but in the end the 9 hour commute every day was what forced me to regretfully leave. I did a few odd jobs closer to home for the next 6 months but nothing that I could see myself long term in.\nDuring that time I was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Drs have given me about 10 months to go but the terminal diagnosis made it super easy to get approved for DSP.', a user said: 'Oh man sorry to hear! Wowâ€¦'"
