        "In response to 'I’ve tried to bust my ass and work tons of OT and never miss a shift and never be late ao that I could get promoted and at every job ever; this has never worked out for me. Wage increases aren’t even different from the slacker. So yeah I’m definitely a “quiet quitter now”. I’m done trying hard', a user said: 'Yeah, my boss told me my extra work was great, and everyone appreciates it, but “you’re not going to be promoted after joining this team full time, just letting you know.”\nStraight up being told no matter how good or how hard I work I’ll just be at the same position not matter what was eye opening. What’s the point of overachieving if it gets me lumped in with everyone else anyways? I’ll work my exact hours and do only the tasks assigned to me, since I have no opportunity to advance.'",
        "In response to 'Honestly though. Most places I’ve worked for just hire outside new employees with no experience to be in charge of everyone. And nobody understands why the people who have 10+ years don’t get promoted to leadership roles.  And somehow a kid straight out of high school is now our foreman 🤦🏻‍♂️', a user said: 'Oh, that freaking sucks. I think companies do that so they can pay less for those higher positions. You’d have to increase the wage of the person who has 10+ experience accordingly. Someone straight out of high school is probably just happy to have a job, so the company can just under pay that position pretty significantly. It’s pretty scummy.'"
