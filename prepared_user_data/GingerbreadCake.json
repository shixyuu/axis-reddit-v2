        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'The earliest reference I could find in a quick google news search is April 1st, 2022. Forbes, and article titled, “Instead of Quitting, Workers are Ghosting, Coasting, Slacking and Cyberloafing”. I would think it was an April Fools joke of Forbes had a sense of humor.'"
