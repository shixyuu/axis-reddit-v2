        "In response to 'So true. When I ended my last relationship, my boyfriend fully broke down into tears and started rolling on the floor bawling his eyes out. I felt nothing. Like, I felt sympathy that he was in pain, but I had just concluded a 3 month process of checking out of the relationship. He had no interest in being the type of partner that I needed him to be, he just liked the type of partner that I was to him. This was years ago when I was in college, so I basically waited until finals were over to break things off because I didn't want the breakup and move out process to affect my grades.', a user said: 'Same - mine cried and said it was sudden. I couldn't cry. I'd already shed all of my tears by that time, and didn't have any left.'"
