        "In response to 'Thank you. I did try to explain it to him when he was marking me down. The real irony is he was sitting there calling me a potential negative toxic presence that was going to ruin team morale the day after I had just handed out hand made Valentine's to my other teammates.', a user said: 'I agree with you and absolutely would be hurt in this aspect of having an evaluation weaponized against you. He is toxic management. His actions are going to damage morale more than providing a sympathetic ear will ever do.\nHe (boss) is going to try and flip this on you. Now that you're not doing the extras that did brighten up your coworkers days, he may try and come back and use this against you.\nDo you have a way to formally dispute the evaluation? Can you speak with HR? He is out of line punishing an employee for listening to someone else vent about the workplace. Venting is healthy. Gets things out in the open so work can continue. I think you need to \"vent\" to someone higher on the food chain that can wrangle him in.'",

He wouldn't be able to terminate me unless I actually did something crazy or consistently not meet my matrix.', a user said: 'Can you talk to your union representative about what happened here?'"
