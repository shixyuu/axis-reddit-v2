        "In response to 'It's all about outlasting editorial. Spider-Man will last longer than the current editor will.\nDuring the Mackie/Byrne run, editorial demanded MJ be removed so Mackie included a Lollipop Man mystery and had her \"die\" in a plane explosion. The moment editors changed, they immediately brought back MJ.\nUnfortunately, OMD has lasted through several editors. However, what we have going for us is stuff like the Nick Spencer run: A run that is entirely the writer saying \"I don't want to do anything new or interesting: I just want to make Spidey be how it was when I was a kid! Kraven's Last Hunt, Chameleon robot things, the Foreigner (Kids love the Foreigner!), a Return of the Sinister Six, roommates with Randy again, and Harry should be dead!\" etc.\nNick Spencer spent his entire run undoing years of Spider-Man stories in the name of nostalgia. It's just a matter of time before an editor comes along with a similar mindset with regard to with the marriage and either demands or allows an actual resolution to OMD.\nIt might take 5 years. It might take 25 years. But it is inevitable that at some point OMD will be addressed.', a user said: 'It's funny how Nick Spencer's run ended up being. Back when it started, I remember watching this\nvideo\npraising Spencer for redeeming Spider-man. Then the same youtuber made this\nvideo'",
        "In response to 'I mean there is also a video on the amazing spider-talk channel where he shares his thoughts mid run( absolute carnage)', a user said: 'Oh wow. I didn't even see that one.'"
