        "In response to 'Thats exactly the problem most places aren't seeing. Plus everyone wants a fully remote role. If it's not fully remote I'm not interested. It's just how I'm looking since I'm sick and tired of the useless office and being in teams and webex meetings with people right next to me when I can be doing the same things from home chilling in sweatpants. Very ridiculous.', a user said: 'Yeah, the idea of commuting 2-3 hrs everyday is dumb when all I’m doing is the same work from home. My last job they were on the verge of forcing everyone back in person 5 days a week, network admins, sysadmins, web developers, etc when all we do is just sit in a cubicle or office to do work, attend meetings on Zoom, and never talk to each other in person, all because of need for an “in person culture”. All while our CIO has been 100% remote in his ranch in central cali. Suffice to say there was an exodus when they announced 5 days in person (exceptions for management of course), then management saying the same \"no one wants to work anymore” bullshit as we were all leaving for other positions.'"
