You get to be ignorant of what people actually do, and when something goes wrong you can just point a finger, cuz you don't know how or what to do so how can you be blamed. Management jobs are useless, train people to communicate and leave them out completely, I'd rather have a lead, a person who KNOWS WHAT YOUR JOB IS, DAY IN AND DAY OUT, and could do it themselves. That's the only person you need at the front of a team. Not a paper pushing biz person, fucking dead weight.'"
