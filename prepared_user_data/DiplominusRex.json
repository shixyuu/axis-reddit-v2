        "In response to 'Linking a poorly sourced website created by someone who has self-proclaimed biases about a subjective and Canadian specific matter is pretty pointless. Yes in the US it would be considered left. Our Conservative Party would even be fairly left. ðŸ¤·\nCBC is centrist in Canada. They support the Liberals, who are also centrist. Thatâ€™s pretty well understood by anyone who understands that there is more than a left vs right dichotomy.', a user said: 'I have a personal friend who is a producer there. He is and has been hardcore left his entire life - working in successive major leftist media publications, and even he was lamenting at how hopelessly, absurdly left the angles and assumptions are they heâ€™s had to pursue in framing news at his own organization.\nCBC is not remotely centrist anymore.  If you think it is, then neither are you.  Itâ€™s too left for even the lifelong card carrying leftists who work there.  Itâ€™s almost to the point of self-parody.  When my friend explained some of the news angles he had to chase, I honestly thought he was exaggerating for comedic effect.  He wasnâ€™t.'"
