        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'The thing is... if your 100 or 110% effort was actually beneficial to you or humanity in general, this would be an excellent trait.\nHumans are hardwired to PUSH... to excell, to innovate...\nI need to EXHUAST myself on this hunt, because our villiage (my family and friends) DEPEND on this food.\n... that's how we've survived.\nBut this \"system\" has hijacked that natural drive, and tries to target it at corporate profits, rather than human progression.\nUnless you're in a rare position where your effort ACTUALLY matters... save the 110% for your home and your family. Give only what's necessary to the job to sustain the part of your life that really counts.'"
