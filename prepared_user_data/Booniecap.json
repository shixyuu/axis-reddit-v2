        "In response to 'How did education debt become the one type you can't escape with bankruptcy etc?', a user said: 'The government started Guaranteeing certain student loans and facilitating government paid scholarships. Schools said “hey!  Why don’t w charge more since we know we will get It?!?!” Then the government said don’t worry you students not on scholarship or government loans guess what we will just make it worse by pay the colleges more. So now we have a bunch of idiots who all want to go to Harvard or some\nOther brand name school in order to get scholarships on how to drink, party,  have college sex. Because they are idiots they many of them don’t qualify for scholarships and so the take out loans. Now these idiots want the government, the same entity that caused half the problem to begin with the other being colleges that continued to rise in price, to pay off there loans. The government, being the government and full of people trying to get more votes for the next election so that they can abuse their positions to gain more power and wealth, is more than willing to subsidize the idiots who divided to take on debt just so they could get a bullshit degree on how to get drunk and fuck while in college.'"
