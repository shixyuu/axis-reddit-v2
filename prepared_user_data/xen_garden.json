        "In response to 'Original Post: Minnesota among top 5 states for quiet quitting’ [External Link]: https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-quiet-quitting-jobs-2022', a user said: 'I still don't know what quiet quitting is.  Does that mean you do your job half-assed because you are lazy or don't give a f?  Or does that mean you do everything expected of you and no more?  Because if it is the latter, I don't see what the problem is.  I generally do enjoy going above and beyond in what I do, but I don't think that should be the default - I just really like what I do, so I'll work late and put in the extra effort.  But if people aren't slacking, what is the big deal?'",
        "In response to 'It means you do your job, the job you are paid to do, and not a bunch of extra shit without extra pay, thanks, or recognition. If I’m supposed to work 40 hours a week and focus on X work then I’m working 40 hours a week and doing that work. I’m not working 45, 50, 55+ hours doing extra work or special projects or other people’s work or spending time kissing ass. That’s what quiet quitting is but it’s really setting boundaries and refusing to be taken advantage of for free.', a user said: 'I don't see why they needed to give this a special name - that's just called doing your job.  When I first heard about this, I thought it was people doing their job half-assed so they'd get laid off and get unemployment rather than quit and get none.  Sounds like the slow news cycle is just drumming up a phony controversy again.'"
