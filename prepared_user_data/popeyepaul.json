        "In response to 'Not really, work-to-rule has a long history as a protest, whereas \"quiet quitting\" refers even to people who are doing fully adequate and expected work.\nWork-to-rule is an organized, wide-spread action in a workplace.\n\"Quiet quitting\" is basically the one guy at the office who asks \"leaving early?\" when you leave at 5PM or expects you to respond to emails at any time, but elevated to having an opinion article.', a user said: 'Work-to-rule sounds a lot like what we in Finland call \"an Italian strike\". Which means kind of passive-aggressively doing your job 100% literally and nothing more. Which is to say that you more or less purposefully do your job poorly because your job description can't possibly cover every little detail that may happen at the work place. I have sometimes done this when I've had disputes with my employees (usually around the time that I've been about to quit) but I wouldn't encourage it as a rule to follow every day because it more likely hurts your colleagues just as much as it hurts the employer. Nothing more frustrating that having to work with a colleague who is always late and doesn't bother to check his work and correct his mistakes. If you show that you can't do even single tasks on your own, don't be surprised if you get a manager that insists on micro-managing every aspect of your work in the future.'"
