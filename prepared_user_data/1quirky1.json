[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/shqpdu0ns7qd1.png', a user said: 'Amazon is trying to increase unregretted attrition to reduce the amount of layoffs that are upcoming.\nI worked there for several years.  I kept hopping teams because the constant optimization/efficiency (read: enshittification) of everything there takes its toll over time.\nHere's what I believe about Amazon:\nAmazon can't miss out on any optimization including those that kill morale and productivity.\nIf someone there is liking their job then there must be some missed optimization because that joy costs money.\nAny person or entity working for/with Amazon never wins.  Either Amazon wins or everybody loses.\nHere's an example of the third item -\nI remember back when Amazon offered people the opportunity to start their own small business delivering for Amazon. They offered leases on vehicles, etc.  I knew it was a complete fucking screw job because Amazon would do it all if it was a profitable endeavor.  Amazon was shedding employee liability and dispersing the workforce to avoid unionization.\nThis would be easier to admire if it wasn't sucking the souls out of so many people.'"
