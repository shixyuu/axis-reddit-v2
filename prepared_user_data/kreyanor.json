        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I dislike the phrase ‚Äúquiet quitting‚Äù. It‚Äôs just doing what you were hired to do. The phrase is used by the oligarch class to suggest people should get blood from stones instead of what their JD says what they should do.\nYes there are cases where sometimes you need to go above and beyond, but if that sometimes is all the time then your management are exploiting you.'",
        "In response to 'There's a difference between only fulfilling the requirements/ expectations of a role and actively doing the bare minimum to not get fired', a user said: 'So your job description.'",
        "In response to 'Fine with me if it works for everyone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nBut none of the redunancy payouts I gave were life changing, couple months pay at most.\nAnd the job market atm is brutal, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be looking right now.', a user said: 'How come so many people from your team were made redundant? Are you bad at managing your staff?'"
