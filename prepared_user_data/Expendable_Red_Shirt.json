Feelings mattered more than anything else and this is what we get from that.', a user said: 'We can thank Reagan and conservatives who have made it so that no matter how hard you work you don’t get shit. We’ve catered to soft republicans and their feelings (war on Christmas anyone?) rather than fix societal injustices and our economic system. Now we’ve got fascists in office making everything worse because they can’t stand to be told no.\nIt’s a sad time. If this country and the world were less conservative we’d still have a work ethic.\nGood on you for calling out conservative bullshit.'",
        "In response to 'Reddit hates Regan more than Hitler, for his time he was one of the most popular president, especially compared to Jimmy Carter. And it ignores the fake that Democrats held office for 20 years since Regan held office, Republicans only held it for 16 years', a user said: 'Can you try that again in English?'"
