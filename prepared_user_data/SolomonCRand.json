Don't let it become an acceptable term [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/fwj0foce59k91.jpg', a user said: 'I’m happy to go above and beyond for managers willing to do the same for me, but I’ve wasted enough years toiling under people who wanted to squeeze me dry while insisting they couldn’t afford to pay me better. If the boss makes it clear there’s no reward for working hard, then I’m just working hard enough to not get fired.'",

        "In response to 'Okay, but do they pay you above and beyond?', a user said: 'My first post-college job, I was able to rise through the ranks and more than double my salary in the process, which was cool up to the point my boss was arrested lol. And I have a few friends in tech that have done very well over the years. I just keep that caveat in there to preempt the “why are you anti-work, my job is great!” crowd. If you can find your niche in post capitalism where you’re making a good living without exploiting anybody, I’m happy for you, but that doesn’t mean I want to hear you tell me how easy it would be for everyone to luck out the same way.'"
