        "In response to 'This is such a fucking stupid thing to do. Their logic is always \"well then we have to replace someone that we promote internally\"\nSo promote someone else until you just have to hire a junior position?', a user said: 'So promote someone else until you just have to hire a junior position?\nI used to work for a design studio that did a lot of work for a big tech company. The way one guy explained it to us was â€”\nyou never hire somone competent or smart in the position or they'll be gunning for YOUR job\n.\nThe notion is someone who does good work who is already there needs to be kept in place for two reasons: a) you're too valuable to the team, I can't allow you to advance, and b) if you're allowed to move up, you're a threat (probably already doing the exec or manager's job for them).\nThat company's corporate culture was an awful rotating door of cascading morons until they finally got bought (partnered!) with another tech company and the brands combined for a short time. Eventually they were quietly erased from the branding all together and no one misses them at all.'"
