        "In response to 'The ceo of our company announced 4 mos ago that he was bringing in his “good friend” to be our VP of HR. She is now my bosses’ boss, has fired 5 people in her 3 mos here, and recently hired a “good friend” of hers to take my managers position, that myself and our other assistant manager applied for (and are very well qualified for). I’m so fucking out of here. I can’t believe this bullshit they think their hourly employees will just ignore. I plan to work right up to the day my new job starts, and give them a ring an hour after my shift starts to say I won’t be there, ever. Fuck your bullshit', a user said: 'Corporate nepotism is icky'"
