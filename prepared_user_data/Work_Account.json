There are always groups of coworkers going out to lunch together or walking the loop on break, and I just… don’t want to make small talk for 45 minutes in a setting where I need to watch out for over-sharing or anything like that  My work is social enough (meeting clients, leading meetings, etc) that I don’t want to share my down time with anyone. Then I feel like I’m perceived as distant or a loner or something (I am).', a user said: 'Embrace it. I do the same thing. It can definitely feel isolating at times though, I get that, but at the same time, I like decompressing in the middle of  the day by leaving my work building and just chilling in my car.
