        "In response to 'I stayed in Japan for the entire month of January for my job this year. I work for a American company that also has a office in Tokyo, talking to my Japanese colleagues, all of them told me they would all try to find work with foreign companies in this case American. Because Japanese companies are very strict and almost always expect you to stay over time, one of the guys there told me he worked for local Japanese company, where he would start work at 8 am and his job ended at 5pm but was always expected to stay late or it \"would look bad\" to the bosses, so he would routinely leave work at 7pm.\nThats no way to live, just a robot life, as soon as you finish work you're too tired to do anything.', a user said: '8am-7pm, but don't forget commute time. So all their \"free time\" went to eat/sleep. Barely enough to survive.'"
