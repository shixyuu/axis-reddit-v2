        "In response to '“Quiet quitting” but you want to stay 5 more years in the hopes your stay outlives your bosses’ stay?\nI would think hard about that strategy and how it benefits you.\nThat said, it’s hard to frame it as a goals discussion if you have no intention of progressing. If you truly want to just outrun the clock and do very little for the next few years, maybe just talk about how you’re happy in your role and feel this is the right pace for you. Focus on how you’ve met your metrics. If pressed, say it isn’t the right time in your life to take on more. Short, sweet answers.', a user said: 'Yeah, I'd call it \"working to the contract\"  AKA doing what the job requires rather than everything that one sees that needs to be done that is outside of the job description.\nOP has learned how to read their boss in that they can now recognize which ideas are unlikely to be brought up again or otherwise go nowhere, and therefore no effort needs to be put into making them happen.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: How to Approach Annual Review After I Quiet Quit Almost a year ago, my boss pulled some power move BS and I made two changes as a result: I took work email off my phone and stopped working more than the expected hours. No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a \"good idea fairy\" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't.\nMy boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise.\nSo now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the \"extra\" stuff has fallen away.\nIt will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?\nFWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years. Thanks!!', a user said: '\"Looking at our metrics, we really got things dialed in over the last several months.  I will continue to look for opportunities for improvement, but I don't see a need for big changes.  What would you suggest Ifocus on over the next 6-12 months?  I value your POV since it has a bit of an outsider twist to it.\"\nTweak the vocabulary as you will to suit your style and what your boss and boss' boss would want to hear.'"
