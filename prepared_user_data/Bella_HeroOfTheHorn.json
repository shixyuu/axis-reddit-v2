        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didnâ€™t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didnâ€™t have to dishes as often, didnâ€™t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldnâ€™t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didnâ€™t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'My husband has taken on ordering groceries delivered, and we get Factor premade meals. I love to cook but all the cooking, cleaning and planning time just doesn't fit my priorities any more. I'd rather work out or do something for myself ðŸ¤·'"
