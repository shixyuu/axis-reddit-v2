        "In response to 'Helfrich does get credit for helping develop Marcus Mariota, when he (Helfrich) was an assistant coach. However, Helfrich inherited a lot of talent leftover from Kelly's tenure.', a user said: 'Helfrich had complacency hit, both with him and the old guard staff at large (Pellum, Campbell, Greatwood, Neal, etc etc) that started catching up to us immediately after Mariota left for the draft. Our defense had already been completely gutted merely two seasons after making the playoffs and getting to the championship a second time. Another problem that doesn't get talked about was the Willie Lyles scholarship reductions hitting around then, which further amplified the recruiting problems that snowballed into the nightmare that was the 2016 season. I remember the hype going into that season was about Dakota Prukop, the thinking being that \"hey, Vernon Adams worked out so great as a graduate transfer, lightning will surely strike again!\" It did not of course, he was very underwhelming and it ultimately pressed us to use a very not ready (at that time) Justin Herbert.'"
