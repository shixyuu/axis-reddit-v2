        "In response to 'Just curious, are you able to make the other fifty minutes actually worthwhile for yourself?\nFor a long time, I thought this kind of job was the dream. Now I've been there for about a year, and it's a soul-sucking nightmare. My days get destroyed because I'll have something like 1 morning meeting and 1 afternoon meeting, and I end up just idling away the hours in between. I usually just surf Reddit or watch Netflix. Best case, I'll get in a workout or read.\nI'm quitting soon to go to an actual job, where they're going to pay me more money to do real work. I don't know if it's just because it's been years since I had to do actual work for multiple days in a row, but I'm weirdly looking forward to it.', a user said: 'Do you have any plans for when you retire? Not in terms of finances, but like, what do you envision yourself doing? If so, do that. With a bit of work peppered in here and there, if you like.\nIf not, well, no time like the present to start thinking about it. Pick up an instrument, or a hammer, go bird watching, change your car's oil, garden, renovate, exercise, shake your ass on TikTok, I dunno, do whatever the hell you want to do that 8-12 hours of looking busy and 3 hours of commuting normally makes you incapable of doing.\nWe talk about having nothing to do when we're not working, then complain that all the things we\nthink\nwe want to do are too hard, too time-consuming, etc.. Well good news! You've got the workload of a retiree and the body of a not-yet-a-retiree, so get cracking!'"
