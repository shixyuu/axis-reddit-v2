        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Not OP, but if I don’t teach in the summer, I don’t get paid for two months.\nIf I’m only allowed one class (which happened last summer,due to similar reasons as OP) I make 1/2 pay for two months.  Recent changes mean I don’t know if I will have one class or two until summer starts, which means it’s difficult to arrange for other work in case it’s lean.\nActively looking for side hustles as a tenured full professor is not where I thought I’d be, way back when.'"
