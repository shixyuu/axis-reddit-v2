        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'I dont want to say biblical prophecy but, hear me out, (I get it is probably bs) but this is what i keeping thinking and cant shake entirely yet\nWe were taught(I saw that with a very fucking great understanding we were taught lies mixed with truth)\nBabylon the great the world empire of false religion(which probably represents rome- prophectically maybe could make a point its the whole world, commerance, religions, and everything else) was supposed to parrlel the fall of babylon.\nThat is river drying up, we were taught it was the people leaving the churchesâ€¦excluded witnesses. But honestly what if all religions have served their purpose for nations to keep people docile and now that they have the upper hand there is no need for it. Similarly what if the waters are drying up and people are leaving included from the false religion Jws'",
