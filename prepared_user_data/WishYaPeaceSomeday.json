If you start calling yourself a loser or a failure you've only hurt yourself and done nothing to solve the problem. People often do this when they aren't sure what the problem is or how to solve it. That's why when I read a tweet showcasing an issue that needs to be addressed. I look to see if the commenter is offering a solution. If they end with a statement like \"the United States is an economic failure\" you know they don't have a solution and worse yet they are only commenting out of a neediness for social validation.', a user said: 'Get rid of First Past The Post voting and make third parties viable.\nPeople deserve the right to vote for who best represents them, while still counting their vote against those they don't want in office.\nElectoral reform is possible one state at a time, outside the two party system.\nLook up a video on FPTP voting for more information.  CGP Grey has an amazing one (all his videos are amazing)'"
