[External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: 'This branding of “quiet quitting” is way more negative then it should be. They are literally labelling doing the job your hired for as quitting. Like wtf, not everyone is going to accelerate at there job, or make an effort to move up. This isn’t a new thing, someone is trying to mix this attitude with remote work to try and give it a negative spin.\nI think any reasonable employer would agree if you do what we hired you for well, your doing your job. If this individual doesn’t try to go above and beyond is that actually a problem, no just means they are competent where they are and are not showing performance of what the next level of the job maybe or different roll. If they are compensated as such it’s not a huge deal.'"
