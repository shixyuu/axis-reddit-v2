        "In response to 'More, that not doing other, extra, unpaid jobs that the company either is or should be paying another person to do is “quitting”.\nOne example is academia right now—professors and staff no longer want (or can manage) to spend the 20-40 extra hours a week doing all the tasks like sitting on endless committees unrelated to their classes, volunteering for move in or ushering events, mentoring, supervising extracurriculars etc. that they’ve been doing for years without compensation for their time.\nSame in my side gigs—over the years we’ve all stepped on one another’s jobs and asked for less than we deserved to get any work or compensation at all when every job is “all hands on deck—remember we’re an arts nonprofit! And someone would do this for experience and exposure”. We are told we’re lucky to have a job at all in this climate, while an email reporting the record endowment and enrollment numbers dings.\nOf course this is the eventual result, and although this media blitz and the “quiet quitting” moniker itself is stupid, I’m liking that it’s being discussed.', a user said: 'I used to work in arts/events full-time and would never go back to doing it non-union. I keep my IATSE union card in my back pocket for when I feel like doing event work.'"
