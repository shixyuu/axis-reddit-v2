It's not your doctor who's keeping you down.', a user said: 'I’d argue that it’s the executive class and upper management classes who are keeping us down.  They’re buying vacation homes while all the while cutting benefits and limiting wages to build “shareholder value.”\nMy wage can barely keep up with inflation most years. Now we have pandemic / post pandemic / war inflation. Good luck keeping up with that.\nHell, I had a first line manager (not even middle management) who would return money from our team’s allocated raise pool because it meant a bigger bonus for him at the end of the year.\nFor reference, I am a “professional” in a large government contractor aerospace company.'"
