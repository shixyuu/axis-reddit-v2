        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I’ve officially ‘quiet quit’ for 2 years now, and I still get recognition points, and the regular pat on the back. I do maybe 8 hours of actual work per week tops. I’m a manager, so I give my team time and space to do what they need and pick their own deadlines. I give absolutely no shit about anything at work. I leave most days at 3pm and no one has picked up on it. I thought I would have been fired or made redundant months ago - but alas, if the work is done, no one cares\nMaybe once every 2 months there’s some mediocre emergency which requires me to work a full couple of day - but I’ve only worked past 5pm once in 2 years. I’m at a big bank.\nPlease - don’t kill your selves at work. It ruins it for us lazy people'",
        "In response to 'Managed to make an extra $25k in bonus last financial year from doing far less than normal. I can’t make sense of it.', a user said: 'The advice I give my team is to do one or two big things a year and stamp their name all over it - rather than doing 10-15 little things. Less is strangely more. But you need to be clued in to what the big things are'"
