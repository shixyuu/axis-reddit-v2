        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'I do exactly this. Work my hours and no more. My mental health has improved greatly for it. And I especially don't feel bad since the % raise we all got this year wasn't even enough to cover my gas each week to and from the office. Which is also why I don't feel bad for refusing to return to the office at all.'"
