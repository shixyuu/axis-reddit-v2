        "In response to 'I've never heard about it until now, assumed it was a joke about overly coddling DMs.  Is this from 3e or some random house rule?', a user said: '3.x in a bit of streamlining had Take 10 and Take 20. Take 10 let you do something as though you had rolled a 10 and could be done basically any time you weren't threatened or under time crunch or the like with some exceptions on both sides.\nTake 20 let you act as though you had rolled a 20 (which for skills isn't an auto success or crit chance or anything) under similar circumstances, but you also couldn't have a specific penalty for failure other than the obvious failure of the skill and it took a lot longer.'"
