        "In response to 'I did something like this 4 years ago--had a client that promised to do some work for 3 months, then told me on a call they didn't do anything and expected me to work 12 hour days through the summer to make up for all the missed work.  Then she laughed.  I was in an office with my boss on a conference call, I stood up, went to my office and started moving stuff to my car.  3 days later my boss called me, offered me a $14,000 raise and a new client if I would come back.  I just got another $12,000 a year raise in March from the same company.  Sometimes the takeaway works.', a user said: 'This was the most \"You've got me fucked up\" action I've heard in a while. And you know it's 100 justified too when your company calls you back like \"Yeah that was fuckery we know and we'll handle it and give you more money no questions asked. You know it's real when a person doesn't even speak, doesn't even change facial expression,  just gets up and starts grabbing their shit.\nRespect is serious thing, and I commend you for not letting a client, or company, waste your time and not give you the respect you deserve in that moment.'"
