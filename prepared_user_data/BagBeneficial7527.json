Just sounds like this person is lazy and doesn't want to do his job like everyone is expected to.', a user said: 'You know how companies keep adding more and responsibilities without increasing pay for years?\nWell, quiet quitting is when employees refuse to accept that situation.  It also means refusing to work off-the-clock or on weekends.\nThey do the same amount of work they always did since their pay never changed.'"
