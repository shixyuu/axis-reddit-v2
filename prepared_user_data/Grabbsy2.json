        "In response to 'Do you think we are effectively post scarcity? Obviously not the ideal definition but post scarcity in terms of needs vs. Availability of resources to meet those needs?', a user said: 'In some respects, its just a matter of logistics.\nWe waste so much food, the whole world could eat more calories than they need to be healthy, if we didn't.\nWe have energy in the form of shale oil that is just sitting there ready for us to get out of the ground, but other sources of gas are so cheap, its not economically feasible to remove it from the ground.\nResources are just sitting there, it is economic factors that prevent them from being dug up, as well as regulatory factors.\nIf the pesky environment wasn't so important, and geopoliticial games were not afoot, I would say we are indeed post-scarcity. Its basically an issue of logistics on how fast you can physically remove and transport the resources.'"
