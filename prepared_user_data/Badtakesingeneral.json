        "In response to 'There are millions of people who own a house and a newer car that are completely oblivious to what's going on out there. Many are shocked beyond belief when life happens and they find themselves looking at having to buy a house or a car.\nMany people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nA mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.', a user said: 'The affordable starter homes have historically been smaller homes in the 30-40+ year old range. Think about what kinds of homes have been built in the past 30-40 years and what people in those places have been doing to prop up their property values.\nPlus we just had 10 years of very little housing production until about 2019 or so.\nItâ€™s kind of the perfect storm - lack of supply plus extremely low borrowing rates.\nI feel incredibly lucky to have been home buying age right before gentrification hit hard.'"
