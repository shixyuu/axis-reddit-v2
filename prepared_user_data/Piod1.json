Your time is finite, why the fk would you give it away free to an employer? Always see folk saying they work hard and give extra but are passed over for promotion or a raise, why?.. Simple answer is your a mug and they are taking advantage of you, why would they impact profits for your sorry arse. There might be exceptional circumstances initially, to plead for you to help out but these often become routine. Then those that are wrung dry are negative to the more savvy, part of the reason for the toxic environment apparent nowadays. If you have to work to pay the bills when you don't want to, your working class. Don't let them fool you, but mostly, don't fool yourself. Namaste'"
