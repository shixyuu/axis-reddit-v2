And for the jobs that require 24/7, it still divides easily in to 4 shifts, though I can understand those jobs still needing to have unique hours to stay staffed.', a user said: 'This would be so much more consumable to the public as it aligns with school schedules.\nTo be honest, at 4x8h parents would at least have a whole day free of children.'"
