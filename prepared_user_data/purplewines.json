        "In response to 'My current place of employment is amazingly effective at creating a quiet quitting environment. It's pathetic how much money we lose because we don't incentivize anything. Turnover rate is over 100 percent for years as well. If I was the CEO or a stockholder, I would immediately begin incentivizing people based on work performance and this is evrn if you exclude all ethical motivation.', a user said: 'See this is one thing I have learned in the corporate world. Some of these employers can receive better advantages to taxes and other incentives by having this type of horrible turn over. They give the illusions of “We’ve hired over 50,000 people this year we’re such good people and gave all those people jobs” 🙄 Meanwhile about 500 people actually have worked there for 20+ years and the other 49,500 worked there less than 90 days! But how can you be upset we’re giving so many people jobs 😭. Literally trash.'"
