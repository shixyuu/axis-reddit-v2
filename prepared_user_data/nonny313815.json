        "In response to 'I'm from the UK so I'm not sure how it works in the US but how does someone get $100k in debt from student loans? Quick google showed the average course for a state college is $10k for a US resident and a private college was about $35k, and thats for the fully course not per year.\nI'm asking because in the UK out student works like this, when you apply for a higher education course so college or uni you're allowed up to 4 years of tuition from the government, It basically gives you a cap so you can never get into that sheer amount of debt. And once you start earning I think its Â£25k a year you then have X amount taken out of your pay basically like an extra tax.', a user said: '$10k for a US resident and a private college was about $35k, and thats for the fully course not per year.\nThat's definitely per year. Wherever you looked that up lied to you.'"
