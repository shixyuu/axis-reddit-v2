They order stuff on their phone and don‚Äôt check afterwards. I even see them in grocery stores just taking up the isle .  I don‚Äôt think they are spitefully doing these things , just feel like they weren‚Äôt raised with manners.

Someone said ‚Äúexcuse me are you using this machine‚Äù bro felt bad and apologized about a 100 times like he was so out of zone of what he was doing. Same thing with doordash .'"
