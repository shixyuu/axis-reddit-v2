[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/zyuip9dwb68a1.png', a user said: 'A lot of the complaining seems to come from small businesses, which tend to be under-capitalized and poorly planned at inception. Does your neighborhood really need a Jersey Mike’s franchise sub shop a few blocks from a Subway franchise? When the owner has a (possibly) short-term cash flow problem where does the cash come from? Selling the owner’s new Tesla or cutting labor costs?\nWhen capitalists glorify the risks taken by heroic ‘job creators’ they NEVER consider the risks taken by employees who go to work for unstable businesses with high failure rates.'"
