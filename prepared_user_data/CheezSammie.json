        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'The problem isn't who they voted for, it's the elections in general. They're purposefully designed to have a literal monster (putting children in cages and sexual assault, racism etc) vs the monsters we already know (corporate overlords) and then they pretend it's a choice. You can't blame people for thinking we need to vote for the corporate overlord when most people are not awake enough to realize they're being played. The best we can do is get them to realize the game instead of being angry that they didn't realize it sooner'"
