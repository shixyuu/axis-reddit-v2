        "In response to 'The simple answer is pay them better but that’s always the last thing they want to hear.\nAlso, it is actually counterproductive to work harder than you’re paid. Cause if your employer is already getting the job of two people from you for min wage, they have no incentive to hire anyone else. And it is possible to make yourself too valuable to promote. It might be more profitable for them to keep you in a lower position that you’re already overworking yourself in than promote you and have to find someone who won’t be as profitable in that same position.', a user said: 'You're 100% right.\nI'm the seniormost member of my team. CEO pulled me into a meeting this summer and asked why turnover is so high in my department. I explained the reason is that we're overworked and underpaid. Thanks to cost of living increasing ever higher, I make less now than I did when I first started here, despite the raises I've received.\nPeople come in, learn what they can and leave for something better.\nI explained if he wanted to keep our team solid, and not have to hire new people every year, he had to do 2 things.\n1) Give a path to move up. Give us opportunities to learn and grow professionally.\n2) Give us GOOD raises. Ones that outpace inflation and cost of living, and they need to be regular, at minimum once pear year.\nHe balked and said it wasn't possible, and then got pissed when I told him the cold reality that our department will never improve unless he's willing to make it worth improving.'",
        "In response to 'Sorry to tell you you’re probably getting shitcanned soon', a user said: 'I wish. The unfortunate part is, nobody has been able to keep up with my work. They want 3 of me. They aren't about to fire me when I'm the only one who can finish their work on time AND they're continually having staffing issues.\nBut if they did fire me, they'd be doing me a favor.'"
