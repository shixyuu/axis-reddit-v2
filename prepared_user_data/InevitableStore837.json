        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'About 10 years ago I stopped travelling with the expectation of doing anything. I'll have 3-5 things that I would like to go see but nothing concrete. I have travelled just to find out I just want to chill, just went to the local pub and talked to people or read a book on the balcony. Currently I tend to limit myself to half day of adventure and a half day just hanging out watching a movie, going into the pool whatever.\nAlso something very fun and rewarding is volunteering at a local charitable organization.'"
