        "In response to 'If you're ever unfortunate enough to have a conversation with one of those die-hard capitalist types, one thing you'll quickly realize is that they do not acknowledge ethics when it comes to making money. Their priority is making more and more money, the only limit is the law, and even then they're only limited by whether or not they get caught. They genuinely do not see this as being good or bad. They see it as the way the world works under capitalism. Their guiding light is profit, and your role in life is to make as much profit as you can, period. It's really, deeply fucking weird.', a user said: 'It’s funny, because this apathetic attitude towards money often leads to such terrible reputations by the public. Morality is never an issue in their own circles: friends who are also in WS or those just blinded by the money. You’d think these guys would care about how others perceive them, but I guess they’re just good at brushing everyone who has less money than them as “lesser.”'"
