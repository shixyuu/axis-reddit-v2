        "In response to 'To David V Johnson's point, we're not an economic failure.  Quit the opposite.  The systems functioning exactly as intended.  The sooner a critical mass of us realize this and take action, the sooner we can start to course correct.  But that graph is a symptom of a disease, except the disease is THE feature, not a bug.', a user said: 'In psychology they tell you when you're facing a problem not to attack yourself, attack the problem. If you start calling yourself a loser or a failure you've only hurt yourself and done nothing to solve the problem. People often do this when they aren't sure what the problem is or how to solve it. That's why when I read a tweet showcasing an issue that needs to be addressed. I look to see if the commenter is offering a solution. If they end with a statement like \"the United States is an economic failure\" you know they don't have a solution and worse yet they are only commenting out of a neediness for social validation.'"
