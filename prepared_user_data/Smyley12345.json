        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting - How do I do it properly Been at J2 for 9 months. Reorg in March completely dismantled my team. Manager new what was happening and fled to a new team.\nWas assigned to a new team a couple of months ago. Have not had any work assigned in almost a month. I log on. Attend a couple of team meetings. And that is it. Asked my current (new) manager if there were opportunities to hop on other projects. They pretty much responded by telling me to enjoy the free time and that they would get back to me. A new manager for my team will be hired within the next month.\nI've applied for an internally posted role with no success. No response to application.\nAny thoughts on how to handle this situation. I literally am doing nothing and earning a paycheck. Am I wrong to continue logging in until I get let go?\nThought about taking PTO for a week. Thinking now that I should just save my PTO, log in, start my mouse jiggler, and go about my business.', a user said: 'J3'",
        "In response to 'Agreed!\nQuiet quitting is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard.\nYou do the job you were hired to do. If you decide you want to do more that’s your choice, if not, it shouldn’t matter. If the organization you work for can’t make good decisions then that isn’t your fault.', a user said: '\"Your job is to do what your boss tells you to do\" is one of those boomer generation things my dad instilled in me that is taking a lot of effort to unlearn.  I still have a ways to go but I'm much happier not being a doormat in the workplace.'"
