Finally, after much wheel squeaking on my part they hired me an assistant, who was 19 with no prior work experience but his family went to church with the boss. Shit at the job, could not teach him anything, but he worked for half my pay.\nSo after i trained him they fired me and gave him my job with no raise.', a user said: 'Honestly, they did you a favor. If 75% of your department quits, quit.\nNoone has a happy story that starts with everyone else quitting'",
