        "In response to 'It is not the police's job to prosecute cases.  It is their job to stop/investigate crimes as they are happening and after they have happened, regardless of what they think, or even know the DA and courts will do - obviously this shouldn't be carried to the point of absurdity like busting every single jaywalker, but in the case of something like these bikers, they absolutely should be all over them because the action itself needs to be stopped as it is happening even if the ultimate prosecutions don't happen.', a user said: 'This is completely incorrect from a legal perspective.\nIn the American criminal justice system, police are the goons of the prosecutor. Prosecutors, not the police control investigation. They don't and should not arrest people for things the prosecutor will not prosecute. If it's unclear, they're supposed to consult the protector before proceeding.\nProsecutors in turn are officers of the court. They should not bring cases that they do not think they can win.\nUltimately at the end of the day, we need to select better judges.'"
