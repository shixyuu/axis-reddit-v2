        "In response to 'They aren't reading their emails. That's part of your job.\nBut that's not my issue. My issue is that OP thinks that's \"quite quitting\", which isn't a thing, is what their co worker is doing. But that's not real.\nIt's a term made up by corporations to make us feel bad that we aren't doing more, but we don't need to do more. We need to do what we were hired to do and that's all.\nClock in, do ur work, clock out leave. Nothing more, nothing less.', a user said: 'Corporations using the term manipulatively and this guy using it to describe his coworker slowing down his productivity donâ€™t have to be correlated.\nChoosing to do less than bare minimum but not quitting seems like a proper definition for it. I completely understood what he meant.'"
