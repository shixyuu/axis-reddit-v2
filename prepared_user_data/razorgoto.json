        "In response to 'The average cost of a house in 1950 was around $8,000 and 20% down was usually required to have any hope of a loan.  The 20% was a little over half the average yearly household income.  Again, I am only trying to point out that saving the 20% was not a cakewalk.  Homes were definitely more affordable back then.', a user said: 'The current average household income income is $63k and median household income is $44k.\nSo the equivalent for today would be ~$31k and $22k for a 20% down for a new home. Houses would have to ~$150k in 2022.\nYeah, not a cakewalk. But much much harder today.'"
