        "In response to 'This \"quiet quitting\" thing has such a weird name. It's literally \"Doing your job.\"\nYou don't pay the price of a 97' hyundai and expect the performance of a F1. If you want you car to run at that speed, well... it will certainly cost you.\nI really hate how this corporate hustle culture eventually became a scam to have workers give their 100% while giving them a 20% salary. What was the point of that in the first place? Why did we allow ourselves to be used like that? I remember people shitting on the french for being on strike all the time, supposedly being \"lazy\" and demanding their rights. Guess what? They are correct and we were the suckers.\nPaying X and getting X\n10\ndoes not apply anywhere else in the market, (certainly not profesional services) why are employees any different?', a user said: 'Idk why they bothered with the “quiet quitting” name. They’re ‘Bare-Minimum-ing’ their active current jobs they are continuing to do. They aren’t quitting.\nHowever, they decided it would be a flashy name for headlines over “can-do attitudes requiring more than the constraints of the job (i.e. ‘giving 110%) are no longer going to be given” or “give us more money if you ask us to do more stuff”'"
