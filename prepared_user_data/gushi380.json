Plenty of folks would be willing to articulate what the movement is about.\nHe's been disturbingly off since the election. Reactionary, defensive, vaguely conservative and angry at the left side of the party. It's crazy you have a progressive media network and you don't have a clue what some of these issues are really about.', a user said: 'Unfortunately they’re going to start hemorrhaging listeners. I’m about to be one and I’ve been sound since we were keeping it 1600.'",
        "In response to 'Oh my god, the discussion on \"cursing\" is just so....modern Democratic Party.\nFavs is playing the part of the establishment shill well during that segment: he presents a false alternative (\"act just like Republicans\") in comparison to people telling him that they don't want republican-lite\npolicy\n. There's an actual alternative that's legitimate: to stake out a position--an\nactually progressive/left populist one\n--and also show some\nfight\nfor it. That doesn't require candidates to sound like a drunken sailor or to ramble on about fictitious serial killer cannibals. Jon either knows that and is playing dumb, or else he really is that stupid.\nAlso, \"cursing\" has no moral value; it's neither good nor bad to curse or to not curse. It isn't \"better\" to not curse.', a user said: 'It’s puritan to not cuss and the crazy religious people care so little about it that trump is going back to the White House after he okd their handpicked VP being hanged.'"
