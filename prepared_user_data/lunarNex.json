        "In response to 'It feels really weird in the corporate world right now. My company is making record profits but is cutting costs wherever they can. We had layoffs, and benefits have been reduced significantly, all while our sales have been growing exponentially.', a user said: 'It boils down to greed.  Investors and executives are demanding more and more profit.  There's only so much pie to go around.  There's two main ways to generate more profit (short term), either increase revenue, which is hard to do, or reduce costs, which is easy to do (again ... short term).\nIf only one company did this, they would simply go out of business due to high turnover and bad product.  The issue we have now is that most companies are jumping on the \"cut costs\" train because it makes short term numbers look good.  CEOs are making SOOO much money these days, they only need to work a few years at that level to be set for life, so they don't care about the long term.  Workers can't go to a different company because they're all doing the same thing.\nSince US politics is based on\nbribes\ncampaign donations from rich \"donors\", workers have no legal representation or a way to change the system other than to form unions.  Unchecked late-stage capitalism allows all this corruption and greed to take place, and there are many types of\neconomic systems\nthat would fix these issues, but the first step is to get money out of politics.  Without that, we're all slaves.'",

At least until the revolution phase starts.', a user said: 'I'm not sure people are desperate enough yet.  They're all distracted with TikTok challenges and the latest Trump tweet.'"
