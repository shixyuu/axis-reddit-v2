        "In response to 'This probably qualifies as an Unethical Life Protip. I did something similar in the past as an IC at a previous company along with my colleagues when a nonsensical performance metric system was foisted on us:\nIt sounds like at least some of your perf metrics are 1) quantitative and 2) transparent within your company (i.e., you can see or deduce the metrics for other ICs).\n1) make a histogram of metrics for ICs comparable to you\n2) assuming you really are in, say, the 9th decile, compare your metrics to the median.\n3) figure out how much effort it takes to stay, say, at the 6th decile (just above median), and do that much.\nTL;DR: if a bad quantitative metrics system is used against you, you can use it right back.', a user said: 'Adding 'foist' to my lexicon immediately'"
