Wages have stagnated for too long, the cost of living keeps going up, and I'm expected to work harder and faster to make your shareholders more $$$$ while I take a pay cut every year.\nI saw my parents struggle and get sh*t on for their loyalty and hard work. I know what to expect.\nSo yeah, no thanks. You're getting what you pay for.\nI dunno what the solution is, but I don't care.
