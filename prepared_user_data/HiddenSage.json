        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'Is this actually new? And if so, is it actually going to impact productivity in the slightest?\nI've spent decades hearing that \"Japanese work culture\" amounted to a lot of people keeping their butts in their seats for unreasonable amounts of time because Japanese middle management falsely equated working hours with productivity. And then also held kinda weird and unreasonable expectations about doing too many after-work happy hours and the like with the bosses.\nThat always sounded to me, admittedly as a dumb American, like a lot of folks who were \"quiet quitting\" all along, by staying on the clock and being fake-productive to kiss up to their superior. If they're just moving the border on that to actually leaving work at a reasonable time, it's not a decline in work getting done - it's cutting out wasteful effort from the white-collar bureaucracy.\nAnd given that there's a lot of studies showing that overwork/burnout actually decreases productivity in the long run, that switch may well improve Japanese work results. Happier workers with a better work life balance get more done in the time they're on the clock. And also have time for their own lives in a way their parents didn't - which could, among other things, help slow down the crash and burn of birthrates across Japan.'"
