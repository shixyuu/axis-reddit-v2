He does one good enough, but ultimately shitty weld, then does a beautiful weld that shows his skill and craftsmanship. Then tells the interviewers: the first is what you’ll get from me for $16, the second is $30.\nThis is the reaction of millions of people being taught that raises/promotion requires that extra effort, just for the company to hire from outside instead of promoting within. I will do what I am required and nothing else, unless it benefits a friend/coworker (maybe taking a shorter lunch here and there to help them button up a project). If you want more, I will need to be compensated for more.'",
        "In response to 'The welder should have done a shitty weld for $16 then less shitty weld for $30. Then do the beautiful weld and say that’s for going over the range and we can talk numbers if you’re willing to negotiate.', a user said: 'This joke is pretty old. I first heard it in HS in the mid 2000’s. I’m sure it could be updated for sake of amounts. The point was the effort-income ratio.'"
