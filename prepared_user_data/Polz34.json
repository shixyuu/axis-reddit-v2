        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'You get paid to do a set of tasks, if you are asked to do more tasks you can ask for more money for it, or accept it if happy. Most job roles aren't stagnant and will change over time as requirements do and that is something people should expect but if it's additional responsibility or a business asking for volunteers for extra stuff them employees shouldn't have to always want to go beyond.\nThe only downside to it is if a business is expecting a lot from their staff those who want to progress end up having to do all the 'extras'\nAt my company (Global) we get yearly reviews and our increases are based on performance and behaviours, I have multiple peers who get the standard achieved each year with the small increase, I have always (in the 9 years here) gotten 'exceeded expectations' and gotten a larger increase. Makes me laugh when they complain about their increase when they aren't willing to learn new skills or help out! I don't consider myself to be a work horse, or do crazy extra hours but I will do my best to get stuff done and support the wider business when in the office.'"
