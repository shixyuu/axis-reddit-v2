I accepted j3 and for the last 3 months I did a total of 0 commits, I just go to meetings and pretend I do some shit\nI just got off my 1:1 with my manager, and got promoted to senior backend dev. I will get a raise of 15%\nLife is funny sometimes', a user said: 'My spouse was promoted to manager and hired 3 direct reports. 5% raise.\nI was quiet quitting sort of too. (Stressed buying a house) Meanwhile, people were resigning. Management got scared and promoted me with a 25% raise.\nSpouse still earns more than me but the message is clear. Raises, promotions, and job offers are NOT as merit based as people assume.\nBTW I am not OE. One Job and a side hustle at night'"
