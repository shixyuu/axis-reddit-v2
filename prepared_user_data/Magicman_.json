        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet Quitting”, not quite quitting, but forcing employers to adapt. [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: 'So this is just doing your job? I guess I have been “Quiet Quitting” before it had a term. If you are going above and beyond you are just being taken advantage of by your employer. I never stay late unless it’s absolutely necessary and I refuse to answer my phone/email outside of work hours. I don’t care if this affects promotion. A job to me is to collect a paycheque to do stuff I like outside of work.'",
        "In response to 'Let’s be honest as well, minimum wage jobs (like working at superstore, Tim Hortons, McDonald’s, janitors etc etc) work ten times harder than most higher paid employees (sorry it’s true) and are honestly the backbones of society', a user said: 'And I have no idea how they exist. I make about double the average income where I live (Maritimes so I’d be poor in Toronto) and I definitely don’t feel well off.'"
