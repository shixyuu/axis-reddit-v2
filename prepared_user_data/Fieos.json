        "In response to 'Original Post: Gen Z is quiet quitting because we've seen millennials suffer through economic hardship. Companies can't sell us a pipe dream. [External Link]: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-quiet-quitting-work-ethic-millennials-money-struggles-2023-10', a user said: 'As a Gen-X, it will be interesting to see the cold war of Gen-Z and firms.  As a principle, firms seek the least sufficient labor for lowest cost.  If Gen-Z work quality isn't great, it will further promote firms to offshore and automate if those pursuits are more cost effective than meeting Gen-Z total compensation demands.\nIf history is any guide, Gen-Z will start competing with each other in the labor market as willing sustained unemployment is only an option for people who come from means/privilege.  The market works based on willing participation in the market, even if firms have created an imbalance in power that favors the employer in the labor market.\nTo raise my family in a middle class lifestyle and to help prepare our children for a bright future... I'm willing to show up to work and work to exceed expectations.  I'll change jobs as needed to maintain meaningful compensation growth, but I'm also putting in the work.'",
