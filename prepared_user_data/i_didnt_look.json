        "In response to 'somwhere deep down he knows. Thats why he got uncomfortable. It would be hard for somebody like him to admit it to himself though, since that would imply that he has been brainwashed and let companies take advantage of him for 30 years. A hard pil to swallow.', a user said: 'Similar situation with a coworker of mine. Long term employee who was all about being \"the best\". Never charged for time in meetings that was outside working hours, paid for gas and repairs in his company vehicle (they appreciate that I'm proactive he said), no raise\nfor 15 years\n, small increase in vacation time, just a total \"company man\".\nAfter a few conversations with him, and him nearly getting fired for \"insubordination\" he started to see how brutally he had been screwed over by the company, and it broke him. Took some significant time off, and came back a totally different person. He said he wishes someone had shown him the truth earlier, since he's so close to retiring, he can't even leave the job.\nWhen confronted with the idea that you suffered your whole career and it means nothing, I can see why people shutdown. My coworker saw what had happened and he nearly had a mental breakdown over it.'",
        "In response to 'What percentage of the population uses shrooms? What a stupid story. Also, they’ll blame anything for lack of productivity', a user said: 'Roughly 7 percent. But use among young people has doubled in recent years.\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4054255-magic-mushroom-use-by-young-adults-has-nearly-doubled-in-three-years/#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=16957316275472&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fpolicy%2Fhealthcare%2F4054255-magic-mushroom-use-by-young-adults-has-nearly-doubled-in-three-years%2F\nThe use of psilocybin can definitely alter your perception of what is, and is not, important. An uptick in use would be bad for the \"hustle and grind\" culture I would imagine. Framing it as a bad thing is the corporate world spewing propaganda against work/life balance.'",
        "In response to 'Psilocybin changed my life. Not in some ethereal divine way but it breaks my ego down and helps me let go of things that I’m perseverating on uselessly. I use it therapeutically about once a month at a normal dose (1-2 grams) and sit out in nature with my thoughts.', a user said: 'My personal experience was similar. Helped me to let go off some of the nonsense that was eating at my mental well being.\nThat being said, I know people who have had their whole lives upended by taking psilocybin. Dedicating your existence to something that is then revealed to you as maybe not as important as you thought can have dramatic consequences.\nMy opinion is that the world would be a better place if everyone got to experience this type of \"perspective awakening\" in a controlled environment.   Most everyone I know whose tried them is better for it, but it would bring about some radical changes in society as well. The Hippies in the 60s started this movement but the powers that be crushed all that, making hallucinogens a schedule I drug, demonizing counter culture, etc. before too many people started \"free thinking\"\nOf course, that's just an opinion but looking at what was happening in the 60s when LSD use was somewhat more widespread, I think a better society would be possible if we all could get some new perspective.'"
