'Rage applying' is the latest form of worker revenge | CBC Radio [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/rage-applying-1.6759642', a user said: 'I hate to say it because shitting on the CBC is part of the conservative two-minute hate.... But the CBC is so far out of touch it's become a parody of itself. Between horseshit like this and publishing articles every day about how horrible the poor landlords have it, or about the struggles of those people that buy million dollar homes and are bitter that they have to drive Uber on the weekends instead of just downgrading their fucking car... I'm about ready to get aboard the defund the CBC boat.'"
