        "In response to 'This \"quiet quitting\" thing has such a weird name. It's literally \"Doing your job.\"\nYou don't pay the price of a 97' hyundai and expect the performance of a F1. If you want you car to run at that speed, well... it will certainly cost you.\nI really hate how this corporate hustle culture eventually became a scam to have workers give their 100% while giving them a 20% salary. What was the point of that in the first place? Why did we allow ourselves to be used like that? I remember people shitting on the french for being on strike all the time, supposedly being \"lazy\" and demanding their rights. Guess what? They are correct and we were the suckers.\nPaying X and getting X\n10\ndoes not apply anywhere else in the market, (certainly not profesional services) why are employees any different?', a user said: 'We ‘allowed’ ourselves because of some empty promise from prior generations that hard work and loyalty pays off with raises, promotions, and loyalty in return. Turns out life was just easier to survive on being mediocre and putting in 110% doesn’t earn us anything other than depression and burnout.'"
