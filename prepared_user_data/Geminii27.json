I have no idea what will happen in the upcoming weeks.', a user said: 'I get you, but this is still non-OE thinking to a degree. If they let you go (and if they do, there's not much you can do to avoid it), you still have an income.\nIn the meantime, because you have that fallback and stability, you can take more risks and be bolder. This could include applying for other positions (which you're doing), networking heavily, and/or using the time to upskill.\nThis last one is actually interesting, because if you apply for jobs within the J2 employer, and they ask what you've been doing for the past weeks/months, you can say that with little in the way of assigned work, you've taken it on yourself to improve your knowledge/skills in areas X and Y so you could bring more to the table, etc.'",

        "In response to 'Original Post: When you quiet quit/ride it out till you get fired, it negatively affects others in this community I had a teammate who had been dropping the ball for a while and was finally let go this week. His output was so bad that my manager noticed and did some digging. Turns out he barely worked at all and was clearly just coasting till he got fired.\nWell, my manager and skip are PISSED and literally called out how they think our old teammate was working multiple jobs. In my xp, they definitely were as they had many signs.\nRegardless, it’s now coming back to bite my team and me with new policies. Yes I’m pushing back on all the BS coming our way and trying to minimize it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if activity monitoring software came up soon to flag suspicious activity as well. This gig has been great for OE for years and now it’s in jeopardy because someone couldn’t just quit when they were done… I have friends (OE and not) at multiple other companies who are dealing with fallout like this as well.\nMy point being, when you pull the anti work card and coast like this just waiting to be fired (which I see recommended here daily), it’s not an isolated event. You get your bag a bit bigger and your teammates (and fellow OEers) deal with the fallout.\nIt helps to push for more RTOs that may have not as it eliminates the possibility of many of these issues. This also affects remote offerings (wayyyy down from what I’m seeing myself in new job hunts)\nHow would you feel if others put your extra paycheck(s) in jeopardy?\nGet your bag, but don’t screw others over while you do it.', a user said: 'Quiet-quitting isn't necessarily underperforming or dropping the ball.\nWell, my manager and skip are PISSED and literally called out how they think our old teammate was working multiple jobs\nFunny how it was only AFTER they were let go... \"Oh yeah let's accuse this guy of things we don't like, but not when he's actually here to be able to dispute them.\"'",
