Having one whole day dedicated to improving your house, yard, chores etc. followed by a day of fun and entertainment, with a whole extra day of mental rest before getting back to work', a user said: 'I think a 6 hour workday would be preferable.  Also, we should always clarify that we're arguing for fewer hours, because everyone I know who works 4 days a week does 10-12 hour days. Not that you can really be productive 10+ hours, but people think you should do that anyway..'"
