        "In response to 'I've actually yelled at co-workers who were not taking their breaks.\nOur half-hour break is unpaid. So you DO NOT fucking skip it. It's fine to pospone it. If a supervisor asks you to work through it, he's asking you to break the local labor laws, and you should come tell me so I can yell at the supervisor. But take your fucking break!', a user said: 'At my work if they ask you to work through lunch that half hour is double time. If you work through lunch but take it later it's straight time. If they want us to do these things they better make it worth it, if not they can pound sand. Never give an inch or they will take a mile.\nI'm the shop steward for my department on nights. While our chargehands are also in the union they act like company men and not memebers. I have no problem calling those scabs out for their bullshit. They are consistantly screwing guys out for dirty pay or restricted pay, happens all the time. It's just as bad as working through break for free. Things are falling apart and no one lifts a finger because they don't want to rock the boat so it makes my job next to impossible even though I have no problem spreaking up. It takes us no where and I might as well piss in the breeze. While firing us is far from easy everyone is scared.\nIf we don't stand for our rights we will be fucked. Companies take advantage anywhere they can but it's so important we stand together and stay strong. In my opinion everyone is to blame at this point, we do it to ourselves. I give the guys shit, I give management shit and all I look like is a mouthy bitch. I don't even care anymore. The best they can do to me is ban my overtime. I'll take the financial hit until something happens.'"
