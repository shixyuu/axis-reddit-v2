Everyone is going to perform their 12 hours per week responsibilities better if there’s only 32 hours of required busy-charades instead of 40. The “pretend to do shit” culture drives both individual contributors and first line management insane, while senior management all the way up to the CEO love it without understanding how much money they lose to it', a user said: 'Oh, we’re cutting hours?\nI’m hourly and apart from maybe 1 hour per week for bathroom and coffee, I can truly bill for all my time. Cutting hours would hurt me, but working 10 per day for 4 days would be awesome IMO.'"
