        "In response to 'Do you understand how rare that is? 90% of employers in this era have no idea how to measure productivity. Tech companies are better about it. Head over to a bank, insurance company, pharma company, or another firm like that. These places have NO IDEA how to measure productivity. That’s a big reason firms like Goldman Sachs pushed RTO. It wasn’t some desire to get ‘value’ out of their CRE - Goldman’s CRE is such a small part of its balance sheet. It was because no one at that company could figure out how to measure productivity.\nTo many, many people ‘presence’ is the same thing as ‘productivity’. At my first job, I used to show up early and stay a little after 5. Wore a suit every day. People thought i was the most productive guy ever, getting a shitload of work done. Reality? I maybe put in 10 hours a week and spent most of the day studying for my masters classes.', a user said: '“90% of employers in this era have no idea how to measure productivity.

For context, I work in the restaurant industry and it’s pretty clear (I think) for us on how to measure productivity.'"
