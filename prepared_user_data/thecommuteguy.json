        "In response to 'There are millions of people who own a house and a newer car that are completely oblivious to what's going on out there. Many are shocked beyond belief when life happens and they find themselves looking at having to buy a house or a car.\nMany people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nA mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.', a user said: 'It's been insane in my area. $1.5M in March 2020 got you a 4400sqft house built in the mid 2000s before the financial crisis. That same house in 2021 was $2.7M, maybe $3M. Right now it will still sell for $2.5M all day every day. 60-100% increase in home value all because people started buying again in a FOMO frenzy after the pandemic shut everything down.'"
