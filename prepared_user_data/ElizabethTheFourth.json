        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'I've been to Japan on a work stint. Tokyo has 6 rush hours. The last two are at 7:30pm and 10pm. I worked late a couple times and caught the 10pm rush hour. Like a moving sea of people all going to the train, as if it was 5pm in NYC. Trains filled to the brim. At 10 pm.\nThank fucking god they're quiet quitting. This is a horrible way to live. I hope they all say, \"i love my country but this is killing me. enough.\"'"
