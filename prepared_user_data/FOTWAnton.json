        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'Depends on your definition of quiet quitting. Doing the job you were paid to do, doing it well and doing it on time is how we get to be a more productive and efficient society. Instead of focusing on face-time, unnecessary meetings, corporate bullshit.'"
