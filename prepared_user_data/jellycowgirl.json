        "In response to 'I live in a suburb of Denver… since things have reopened, traffic has gotten worse and worse to the point of being crazier than pre-COVID times and it keeps getting worse, I see at least 2 major accidents driving in and 2 major accidents driving home(not fender benders, cars demolished or flipped). I’m losing 3hrs to 3.5hrs total a day on what should be a 30 minute drive. I get in to Denver @6:55am, work my ass off, only to leave @4pm and face a 1.5hr to 2hr drive home. It’s really starting to get to me. The mental and even physical health effects have become overwhelming. After a year of this heavy traffic, I am depleted, to say the least. And this is all for something I could do from home… I work very independently and barely ever even have contact with any upper management unless I screw up, which is rare. My presence at the office means NOTHING. Yet, if they don’t see that badge swipe and parking scan, I’m in trouble. So yea, he is so detached he has no idea the effects doing a WFH job in the office have on someone. I’m not complaining, bitching, or saying I’m fragile. I’m just stating the facts of how I feel. No one wants to make a 2 hour drive at the end of an exhausting day. It’s incredibly draining, and it’s all for nothing.', a user said: 'I feel you. I grew up in Seattle. I worked at one end of town, lived on the other side & went to school in another city. My commute one way was 1 hour and 15. The stress was immense and really caused trauma. I became ill doing that.'",

GTFO.'"
