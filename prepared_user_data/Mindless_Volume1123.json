        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'My favorite part of travel is acting like I live there. Am the touristy stuff is cool, but you need some days to just soak in where you're at. I used to spend time at parks and people would just sit next to me to chat,and that was lovely. I also took some cooking classes to learn about local food and ingredients. If you have a place to cook where you're staying, definitely visit the grocery stores. That way you can save money, and see what people buy. You can even make your home foofs so that you can have a piece of home to reset before doing more touristy things.'"
