        "In response to 'Original Post: Homer Simpson (1995) explaining quiet quitting 27 years before people thought quiet quitting was a new thing. [External Link]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYXzHjbfMDk', a user said: 'Because 'quiet quitting' is a new term designed to put the blame on the worker for 'not' doing their job, despite actually doing their job.\nIt's called 'Working to Rule' meaning that if it's not on the contract, you don't do it. That's the bosses problem to find someone to do the task if it's not on the contract. It's what we all should be doing, as the vast majority of us already make more money for the company than we are given in return as a wage, so why the fuck should we do even more work we don't get paid for.'"
