I prefer “doing what you’re paid for” to be much more apt.', a user said: 'I literally never heard this term before the pandemic.

If I didn't get a promotion in the last 3 months am I being \"quiet fired\"?\nIf they want employees to act like they own the company they could try giving them some equity.'"
