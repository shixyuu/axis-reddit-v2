        "In response to 'Original Post: How many of you have \"quiet quit\" and when did it start for you? I got to say for me I quiet quit my last job 5-6 years into it after realizing I didn't have a future with that company, but I never left because I was at least getting paid and now have a decent savings account because of it. I legit started my new job early this year and I've already quiet quitted. I hardly do the bare minimum since I gave them a whole summer of hard work and not a single fucking praise. Or even any kind of \"hey keep it up you've been doing an awesome job\". The moment I make a mistake I feel like it destroys everything i worked hard for so what's the point anymore? I'm just going to keep working enough so I don't get fired, but if I do I doubt I'll be upset over it. It also just seems the way 2023 has went if the economy and housing market continues to stay awful next year I can already see people quiet quitting for 2024 and it hasn't even started yet!', a user said: 'Sooo slightly different but I’ve been quiet quitting half my job for a while now. Basically I’m in a role that never existed pre pandemic, and only came about as a way of giving someone enough to do to justify their existence during the slow period when we reopened. Problem is, now we aren’t slow, and the “side job” that was tacked on to my primary role is now taking up the vast majority of my time, and easily comprises a full 40 hour work week, which I don’t even have time for, since I do have other responsibilities. But I like the side job better, so Ive been finding a variety of ways to avoid doing as much of my primary role as possible, and now it seems like splitting me off and letting me do my thing might actually be in the cards soon.'"
