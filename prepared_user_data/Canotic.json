        "In response to 'Its work to rule not working to the amount agreed to in the hiring contact?', a user said: 'Work to rule is more like adhering slavishly to the rules and regulations in order to cause a slowdown.\nIn every workplace there are a lot of rules that \"should\" be followed but everyone actually cuts corners because the rules are stupid. It could be that you're required to document everything you do, but most people just give a very general overview of what they did. Or it might be that people need approval to buy office equipment, but in reality this is only ever used for expensive things like copiers or computers.\nWork to rule would then to write extensive documentation about\neverything\nyou do, including writing documentation about the time you spent writing the documentation. Or getting approval for every single expense, even if it's just a pen or paperclip.\nThat's work to rule. It's used as a way to protest without giving management a reason to fire you; after all, you're just following the rules as written.\nWorking your agreed upon hours for your agreed upon pay is not work to rule, it's just work. That's what an employment\nis.'"
