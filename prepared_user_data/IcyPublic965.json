        "Quiet quitting - How do I do it properly Been at J2 for 9 months. Reorg in March completely dismantled my team. Manager new what was happening and fled to a new team.\nWas assigned to a new team a couple of months ago. Have not had any work assigned in almost a month. I log on. Attend a couple of team meetings. And that is it. Asked my current (new) manager if there were opportunities to hop on other projects. They pretty much responded by telling me to enjoy the free time and that they would get back to me. A new manager for my team will be hired within the next month.\nI've applied for an internally posted role with no success. No response to application.\nAny thoughts on how to handle this situation. I literally am doing nothing and earning a paycheck. Am I wrong to continue logging in until I get let go?\nThought about taking PTO for a week. Thinking now that I should just save my PTO, log in, start my mouse jiggler, and go about my business.",

I'm like...is this a trick. I'd prefer to stay in the company and keep collecting checks versus waiting to be let go. I have no idea what will happen in the upcoming weeks.'",

        "In response to 'Check your state law on PTO.    Do you get paid PTO if you quit or are laid off?\nIf you get paid for your PTO after you leave, just keep that as a nice bank for later.    Don't take PTO, you're already on it ;)', a user said: 'will do. thank you.'",
        "In response to 'Keep cashing those checks and be thankful you’re not stressed out. Lol take your vacation, live your life. It sounds like you feel bad for taking money from an employer and not doing any work. You need to erase those thoughts from your mind.', a user said: '❤️❤️❤️'",
