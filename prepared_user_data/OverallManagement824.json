        "In response to 'We call it “working your wage” here.  Even as a first-level manager, I taught some of my employees this principle and I never held it against them if they chose to implement it.  I was on their side, because I’ve been in their shoes; even in lower-level management (especially in grocery or retail), I wasn’t paid what I should have been, so I also “worked my wage.”  This “QuIeT qUiTtInG” crap needs to stop - it’s not an accurate descriptor at all.  It’s just annoying.', a user said: 'In the car business we were encouraged to \"work your pay plan\". The idea was that we were commissioned and the compensation was designed very skillfully to reward us for specific behavior, so if you just work your pay plan everyone will be happy. Yeah well, that works until it doesn't. Suddenly they get upset that you're doing X and not Y. Sorry man, just working my pay plan. You know... You can change it if I'm not doing what you need. It's literally YOUR pay plan. Why don't you just change it if you don't like the results?\nFor some reason this makes managers angry. Who knew?'"
