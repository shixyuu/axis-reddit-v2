        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: 'I work in healthcare and I’ve had periods where I’ve only done the bare minimum or less. It does feel like a thankless job sometimes. I’m a medical assistant so I can’t really move up without more education and I don’t have the time or money for that right now.\nI’ve also had periods where I’ve gone above and beyond, but mostly in an effort to make my work environment better for myself and my coworkers. I’ve led lots of projects and committees about safety issues and process improvements. It usually isn’t appreciated, I feel most of my managers hate me because I call them out on their crap. But at the end of the day I feel like I’m providing the best care I can for our patients, and hopefully a little peace of mind for myself.\nNot sure where I’m going with this. But take care of you first. Any job is only temporary. You’ll know when it’s worth it to put in the extra effort.'"
