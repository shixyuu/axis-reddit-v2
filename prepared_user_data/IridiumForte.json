That isn't at all what would be implied to me.\nQuiet quitting imo is going into work and doing a shitty job KNOWING you're going to get fired at some point, and seeing how long you can last getting paid to do little.'",
        "In response to 'To me it seems more like quiet self-sabotage.\nI’ve been with my employer for 19 years and a hiring manager for 6.\nCautionary tale:\nAn employee of mine has been there 8 years and has been using the quiet/quit, work-to-rule approach from day one.\nThey have now forwent $7/hr in wage increase by failing to meet raise expectations. Instead of making $26/hr, they are just below $19/hr.\nNew hires are now starting at a higher wage because COL has increased faster than this person’s wage increases.\n1) 8 years in, makes less than first-day employees.\n2) Will take 7 years of slightly more than bare minimum and no more write ups just to get to the wage they should already be at today.\n3) This person has a 45 minute commute one-way just to work hard at not working hard… at an employer’s discount.\n4) oof', a user said: 'lol, bro, employed for 19 years, and a hiring manager for the company and you don't see how fucking wild that is? amazing lol'"
