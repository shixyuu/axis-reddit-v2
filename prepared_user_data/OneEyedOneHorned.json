        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: '\"Quiet quitting\" is a term first used on TikTok on\nJuly 26, 2022.\nIt was picked up by\nHuffPost\nand\nNew York Post\n, both on August 2, 2022, both of which are owned by Rupert Murdock.\nBefore the TikTok video and these two \"articles\", the term \"quiet quitting\" did not exist.\nIt's not \"a thing.\" It's not a trend. It's a corporate ploy to get burnt-out people to be complacent and quiet so they can be quietly fired for skating along instead of looking for better jobs, asking for better pay, or complaining about current issues in our economy and workforce. It also, conveniently for the business owner, encourages the worker to stop talking about unions, rights, or wages hence the \"quiet\" \"quitting.\"'"
