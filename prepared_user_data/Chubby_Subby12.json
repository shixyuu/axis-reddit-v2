        "In response to 'I was a maintenance tech at a nursing home before, I called in a day before because I was in the hospital and fired me but not stating any reason because we are a at-will state.\nBut anyways they denied my unemployment and got it but it took 2 weeks for unemployment to get shit sorted out. It pissed me off they actually tried to deny me.  So I called the department of health and told them every building infraction and cost them a lot to fix.  Friend told me they were fucking pissed at me at the next monthly meeting.', a user said: 'Good for you! I got denied unemployment by my boss at the height of the COVID 19 shutdowns. Just before everything locked down, she let me know she was cutting my hours to part time, and I was like no, that’s not going to work and she basically told me I could leave that same day. Everything shut down like the next week and I couldn’t find another job, and she denied me unemployment. I appealed it. She didn’t show up to the appeal, and I was found to be in the right. I was so happy. I don’t know if having to pay unemployment messes with companies, but I hope it messed with hers, haha.'"
