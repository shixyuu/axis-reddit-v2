        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'It shouldn’t have to be the trend.\nIdeally it should be exactly what you do at work.\nYou come to work, do your job to description, finish at the end of the day. A day’s work for a day’s wage. \nIf you want to go further agree that certain extra objectives and roles can be taken on, and this would count towards pay rises and progression.\nUnfortunately it doesn’t work that way so people who “quietly quit” are seen as the abnormal.\nCompanies keep wanting more out of fewer staff, not forgetting that full time has been generally reduced from 39 hours to 37.5 across the board - you work 20 minutes less per day which you won’t notice but the same amount of work has to be done, plus you get £50ish less a month in pay (based on current min wage) and the company will likely have you “cross-training” and try to turn all staff into general assistants so you can be told to go and do a little bit of everything at a moment’s notice, so the company has fewer staff that can supposedly do more.'"
