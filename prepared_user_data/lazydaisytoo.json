        "In response to 'The term is a misnomer started in a TikTok video that went viral and was picked up by the media. It is actually a concept called Work to Rule which is the concept that you just do the bare minimum for what you are paid to do and do not go above and beyond. In the US, though, work culture has been formed to expect employees to go \"above and beyond\" and we as workers have been conditioned to grind and do the most. People are discovering that all that hard work and sacrifice is only getting us more work and no more pay. Now that people are just doing what they are paid to do, corporations and businesses are panicking because they are losing productivity and the free labor they are used to having. We are all saying, no. We aren't working for free anymore.', a user said: 'I learned the hard way that doing an exceptional job only got me paid more because of overtime. When I asked for a raise this spring (after not getting one for over a year) I was told that I hadn’t shown the manager that I deserved one. Gave notice on the spot, and only did that so that I didn’t get screwed out of my PTO. Otherwise I would have just walked out.'"
