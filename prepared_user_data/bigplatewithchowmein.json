        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: '“It’s only quiet quitting when it’s from the Champagne region of France, otherwise it’s called boundaries”'"
