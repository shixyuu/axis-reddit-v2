        "In response to 'It's just comics. You're not gonna be quizzed on them. You can look up anything you want.', a user said: 'Almost nobody wants to need to have a wiki open to feel like they are getting a full understanding of the comic they're reading. I think actually there are lots of X-Men  runs where you can just jump right in with no context required, but recommending those is much more productive  advice to a potential new fan than \"you can  look up anything you want\" - it's just comics, as you say, it's not Ulysses.'"
