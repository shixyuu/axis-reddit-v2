        "In response to 'Original Post: [Discussion] Pod Save America - \"Is Biden Quiet Quitting?\" (12/17/24) [External Link]: https://crooked.com/podcast/is-biden-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'They can’t be serious, defending the time change.\nLOL \nLiterally, nobody wants that.\nAlso, it’s not practical for some states to observe it and other states not widely across the board as they suggest. Very strange argument. I know there’s a couple of examples right now, such as Arizona, but imagine the US were half the states observed the time change and half don’t. It makes no sense.'",
        "In response to 'I don’t know that I have strong feelings in permanent DST vs permanent Standard, but I absolutely do want them to just pick one and be done with the switching back and forth', a user said: 'Exactly'",
        "In response to 'I want this. Where I live, if we didn’t fall back, it wouldn’t get light outside until after 8. Think what that would do to morning traffic and kids getting to school. If we stayed on standard time, it would get light before 5 in the morning, but sun would set closer to 8 pm.\nI am absolutely on board with the time change; so much for “nobody wants this”', a user said: 'I stand corrected; i’ve never met anyone who likes the time change so I guess you guys are out there lol.\nI’ve always dropped my kid off when it’s dark in the morning or got her on the bus and never thought twice about the daylight. I’d rather have more light in the afternoon and evening, where it’s light out and we can do stuff.'"
