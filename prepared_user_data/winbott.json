That is just marketing capitalists are doing to make it out to be something bad.\nYou are just doing exactly what they are paying you to do.', a user said: 'If the company won’t go above and beyond for you why do the same? Companies work to the letter of their contracts so why should workers be expected to do any different? You cannot be fired for working to the terms of your contract. It’s not quiet quitting it’s basics of contract law and capitalism.'"
