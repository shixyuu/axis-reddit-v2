        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'As someone who doesn't get the honor of travelling often but am currently on my own trip: it's more than alright to rest in your accomodations. Having such demanding expectations of yourself and your time can be one of the fastest ways to sap fun out of those little things! Especially if in your daily life you grind and work in order to have the time to enjoy these lovely travels; You deserve to rest. One of my favorite acitivities on my current trip was taking a book to a local park near my hostel and reading and people watching and eventually dozing off under a tree! (not necessarily the safest everywhere, but be aware and safe♡)\nTLDR- It is your life, your money, your trip♡ Vacations are for existing as you wish (ideally) without the burden of outside expectations.'"
