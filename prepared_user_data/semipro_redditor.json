        "In response to 'Original Post: I for one am grateful for APDs quiet quitting bc my vehicle tags are 3 years expired with no plans for renewal on the horizon. Living dangerously over here.', a user said: 'Got caught 4 years expired by a state trooper when he was behind me at a light. Dude literally laughed as he was telling me it was a record for him. Also told me if I renew before the court date the ticket goes away. So really not much of a reason to renew until you get caught.\nWord of warning though, expired tags are used as an excuse to tow your car for being abandoned. So careful where you park'"
