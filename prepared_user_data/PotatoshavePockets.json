        "In response to 'yea it started as a bullshit tactic for the powers that be to shame people for doing “the bare minimum”, i.e their job description, instead of going above and beyond for zero compensation. at first everyone rightfully saw it for the manipulation tactic it is. now for some reason people are actually using it unironically, it’s wild', a user said: 'Agreed. Of all ways to push companies to bring RTO I just don’t understand why that was the tactic. Even my company had an all hands call where the jist of it was we trust you and we’ve alway’s been Remote work friendly.\nGood friend of mine wasn’t so lucky, his company was remote even back 15 years ago but quiet quitting was enough for them to enforce a full hybrid schedule. I can’t even imagine commuting again it’s so nice not dealing with traffic daily.'"
