        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: 'this behavior can be easily identified, and you can be easily replaced at perhaps even great loss to the company.\ngreat loss means an excuse for missingt his quarters numbers for your business unit\nit also means a great bonus for acquiring your replacement successfully next quaarter. they will of course be paid more than you, and this is tactically a superior place to be in: an employee supposedly-satisfied at fresh hire making X+1/hr is more controllable than a long term employee making only X. Caving to the employees request for more compensation only results in a power disruption.\nso in the end you see, you're doing what they want. they'll find you, and so I'd have another job lined up already for when they do.'"
