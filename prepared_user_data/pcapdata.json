        "In response to 'I do the math every year with premiums and out of pocket max comparisons, but since healthcare is so overpriced in the US it always boils down to this: Any real medical emergency is going to put me over my OOPM anyway, and once you add the premiums the cost of all the plans is within a couple grand a year. So I take the cheap plan, if I don't have a hospital visit I save $4k, if I do have a hospital visit I lose $2k. I figure I'm not in the hospital every year, so in the long run it's net positive.', a user said: 'I wonder if every plan doesnt’t include an “out-of-pocket maximum” because there are still people posting hospital bills where the insurance only paid like 5% of the total for an in-network provider and told the patient “Sorry, guess you’re fucked!”'",
        "In response to 'I quiet retired.  I’m one of those MBA guys.  I left a good 6-figure salary corporate career job because I just could t take it anymore. After my husband died, I didn’t care anymore; it didn’t matter to me. Career was so unimportant anymore. So I stopped caring, got offered severance and took it. Never want to go back. I soft retired. I got a job at a doggie day care and am happier than I’ve been in awhile. I play with dogs all day making enough to meet my minimal expenses.', a user said: 'I play with dogs all day making enough to meet my minimal expenses.\nThat's the dream!'",
