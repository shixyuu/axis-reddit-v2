Uber only gives customers 5min to be late for a ride before the driver can cancel it and take a fee. If you order food, it’s your job to be by your phone. These apps generally screw drivers over non-stop for the customer and corporate to benefit, so I think it’s fine for drivers to have a few ways they can benefit. Especially when customers being slow means money leaving driver pockets.'",

I think it’s completely fine'"
