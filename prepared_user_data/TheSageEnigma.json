Unfortunately it's a very different situation when they've come to rely on you as a top performer.  It's a greater loss to them, and they take it very, very personally.\nAdmittedly, I didn't last long after that.  I ended up in a shouting match with my boss, who then demanded that I write my own PIP and present it the next day.  I physically could not degrade myself like that, and so I tendered my two-week notice instead.  It was the last day anyone at the firm spoke to me... so I sat around for two weeks twiddling my thumbs.', a user said: 'Why didn’t they talk to you? Are you a slave who has no right to say “no”?'",
        "In response to 'You come across as having a big lack of accountability honestly. I think you’re too bitter to have much of a future at your current company. You can take your performance down, sure. But I think a good parallel path would be to dig into why your attempts to find a different job have failed. If you’re as good as you say you are, you would do well to find a position commensurate with what you perceive are your skills and contributions.\nIt reads like you’re blaming everything external to you to the reason why you’re unhappy.', a user said: 'Typical corporate gaslighting'"
