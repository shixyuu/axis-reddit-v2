        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'Nono, there\nis\n. Quiet quitting isn't 'doing the minimum you're contracted to do', it's 'turning up at work and doing the absolute bare minimum that it doesn't immediately get picked up by your bosses as you lazing about'.\nWhat youre talking about is being contracted to make 25 widgets and only making 25 widgets. Quiet quitting is being contracted to make 25 widgets and either making ten widgets in a standard workday, and looking busy when the boss walks by, or making 25 widgets, but skipping all of the QC and work that makes them\ngood quality\nwidgets. You do\nless\nthan you're contracted to do. Doesn't matter what the bosses expect of you - say you're contracted for 25 widgets, but they demand 40 widgets, only making 25 widgets is just filling the terms of your contract.\nQuiet quitting requires that you specifically be\nlax\nin your job.'"
