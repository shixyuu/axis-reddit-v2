        "In response to 'Original Post: How to Approach Annual Review After I Quiet Quit Almost a year ago, my boss pulled some power move BS and I made two changes as a result: I took work email off my phone and stopped working more than the expected hours. No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a \"good idea fairy\" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't.\nMy boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise.\nSo now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the \"extra\" stuff has fallen away.\nIt will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?\nFWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years. Thanks!!', a user said: 'As others have said, you definitely want to focus on the positives and and what you can do for the company. Maybe include the struggles of having to work with a team that's short staffed and how you are looking forward to doing your part in bringing any new hire up to speed so you can exceed those metrics.\nI do find one thing concerning, quiet quitting a job you don't plan to stay at is one thing, but doing so at a job where you plan to stay is something else completely. Maybe you should make sure your mindset is in line with your goals. I'm not saying that you should burn out for the sake of the company but possibly find some happy(er) medium.'"
