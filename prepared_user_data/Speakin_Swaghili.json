If a business relies on employees charity then it shouldn’t exist.\nThere should be a serious investigation into a lot of hospitality businesses as they take the piss when it comes to employee hours. Having worked on the bar while waiting for admin to come through I can confirm that hours will be taken off your payslip.\nI worked for a Greeneking pub, I have and will always advise people against working for that company. They steal wages and treat employees like slaves. For the heat wave they sent us tiptops, even though our takings were outstanding.'"
