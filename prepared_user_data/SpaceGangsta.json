        "In response to 'In my old job (construction) the more you did, the more you ended up getting compensated (in piece-work, even more true).  The funny thing is, is that the owner of the company I worked for says all the dumb shit like \" nobody wants to work anymore\" meanwhile he's got a crew of 20 guys, putting in 50-60hrs week 6-7 days a week (travel work)- literally all they do is work!  I mean, he pays really well once you gain the skills, starting pay is $25 plus per diem, ot, and dt.  Foremen are making $42/hr- you just need to find someone willing to trade their life for that.\nAnd buddy, it ain't worth it for how shit the industry is these days...', a user said: 'That’s how being a mechanic is. Especially if you’re union. The mandatory minimum pay is 30 hours a week in Illinois. But you get paid book for a job. If it’s quoted in the manual as a 3 hour job and you do it in 1.5. You still get paid for 3. The top guys clock in for 40-50 a week and get paid for 60-80. He’s got mechanics that make $125k+ yearly. The lazy asses book 20 a week and still get paid 30.'"
