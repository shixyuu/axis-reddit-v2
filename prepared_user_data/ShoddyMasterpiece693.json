        "In response to 'Why? These types of workers exist in office too. Managers are still responsible for replacing bad employees, their job doesnâ€™t somehow happen automatically when in the office any more than wfh.', a user said: 'Right. Two different workplaces, but I saw performance issues punted far more in an office setting when managers didn't want to deal with the hard \"feelings\" associated with a reprimand or PIP. They just silently sat and hoped the person would move on. I moved on first instead of waiting longer than I did for them to deal with the problem.\nAt my remote job, multiple people on my team (similar to OPs) have been placed on PIPs and then exited when/if expectations weren't managed. These people were also the first to go in downsizing measures.\nI have a better manager remotely. Bad management is almost always the problem when performance issues are not addressed...not the work setting.'"
