        "In response to 'Automated or not, there is no more juice to give.\nI don't think that this analogy works.\nBut automation will be the answer to most of our problems. AI will either doom us or save us.', a user said: 'I agree.  Automation is the future.  That's the natural evolution of technology to automate tasks to make life easier.  Problem is there's going to come a time when little if any human labor is needed.  What are we going to do about earning a currency to pay for things?  Will  things become plentiful that we don't need to worry about currency?  I like that at least 1 politician, Andrew Yang, has been thinking about the future and pitching ideas.  Wish more would have half of a brain to pitch ideas rather than blaming immigrants.\nAs for AI, I want to clarify you're probably thinking of Generative AI (ChatGPT).  It's limited to relying on copying what already exists rather than creating something new.  Not saying we won't get truly sentient artificial intelligence that can think and act like a human but better.'"
