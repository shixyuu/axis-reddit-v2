I had the most enjoyable day and it help recharge my batteries.', a user said: 'This is actually genius. Sometimes the best travel moments are just living like a local for a day - grocery shopping and watching random TV shows. Did the same in Paris once - spent half a day in my Airbnb watching French game shows and eating supermarket cheese. Zero regrets. It's like hitting the reset button on your travel energy.'"
