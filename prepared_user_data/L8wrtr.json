        "In response to 'Same with teachers. It's actually kinda insane to think about what a school would be like if every single teacher did exactly what they were paid to do and no more.', a user said: 'EXACTLY. Teachers have a very specific contract. Details from one contract to another may very, but the basic picture is the same, teachers are simply expected to perform far beyond the very specific duties of their contract, expected to put hours beyond what is outlined, spend personal funds for basic needs, perform tasks beyond their scope… all because they love teaching they’re expected to work for far less, doing far more work simply because the ‘job is the reward’\nFuck that.'"
