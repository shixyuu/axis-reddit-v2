        "In response to 'Actually it’s very shocking that Kody always said Christine needed to put more effort into their marriage. Christine had 6 children, watched ALL the OG children so Meri and Janelle could work, and still had part time jobs. Robyn had her kids doing the MSWC shipping, never worked, always had Nannie’s… what to hell does she do besides keeping Kody sexually satisfied? \nRobyn was able to treat Kody like her best customer because all the hard work of being a mom was being done by others. I’m sure Christine could have been better in the sack too if she hadn’t just watched 13 kids, cooked and cleaned.', a user said: 'I’m sure she was fine…even if he had ED, he’s tell them to, “blame yourself if I can’t get a boner.”🤮'"
