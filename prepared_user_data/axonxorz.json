        "In response to 'I thought quiet quitting was just continuing to show up without really doing anything but the bare minimum to look like you're not useless?\nI'm all for the downfall of the corporate propaganda, guess I'm just confused what is meant by the term now.', a user said: 'In the UK, they have the term \"work to rule\", which means you do your work to the rules that are set out - no more, no less. This is what employees mean when they say quiet quitting.\nEmploy\ners\n, on the other hand, are trying to rebrand it to what you've written.'",
        "In response to 'Interesting.\nSo is that like basically if you don't make the rule I have to clean the bathrooms in my official job duty I can't be told to do it one day I come in at random because the janitor got fired?\nRegardless of course the reason people would be doing that is the businesses fault not the people.', a user said: 'businesses fault not the people\n1000% agree with you.\nLike everything, it works both ways. If I get on great with my boss, and every so often I need to clean the bathroom, no problem. But if my boss is an ass, or the boss/company\nknows\nthere's a systemic problem (lack of contracted janitor), and it's just easier to get little axonxorz over there to do it because he's already here?\nFuck that.'"
