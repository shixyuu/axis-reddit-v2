        "In response to 'Nope. Act with integrity no matter what. The real wage of a job is the person we are able to become because of it. But this applies to them also! Everyone has a responsibility to be their best and most ethical/ true self, and the whole universe is waiting for THAT. Underperforming the expectations of a job doesn't help you. Do your best every day and then switch to something better when you can. You agreed to the wage, now do your best! Do exactly what's expected of you, nothing less, but don't put your neck out either to do more than is required. And get more education if you can, and brush up your CV/Resume until it shines to find another position + get more education if need be. Good luck!', a user said: 'You do absolutely have an obligation to yourself to be your best self, but that includes an obligation to insist on being paid for the work you do, doing the work you're paid for, and saving your energy for the things that are important for you.\nThe real wage of a job is the money you're paid. We can't be so na√Øve as to treat a job as an opportunity for growth if our employer does not treat it the same way, and the bigger your employer is the more likely it is that you are seen as a necessary cog that they will pay the absolute bare minimum to keep spinning.\nGetting more education, finding easier and better paying work, spending more time with your young family, building up funds to travel the world, these are all great things to do with your spare energy and time. Unpaid overtime because that's just what good people do is wage theft with a thin veneer of justification.'"
