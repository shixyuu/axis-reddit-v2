        "In response to 'Yep what a way to bankrupt the pension system, alot more people are just gonna take the contribution cash payout at separation if they have been contributing 9%', a user said: 'A lot of people won't know, and have to separate to do so.  Do they get paid back with interest?\nThat's an insane amount.  I was upset to be one of the first people to pay 4.4% at FERS FRAE, they just need to make everyone pay the same amount, even it's a bit more (eg 4.4% for everyone, even people hired before 2014 no matter when hired.  Because they are all working at the same time).  Actually'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'that is CRAZY.  One of the reasons I quit is because some people were paying FERS at .8% and I had to pay six times more into the pension at 4.4% when I came back right after the change in 2014 (I was only part of the feds a year the first time).  Now they are going to pay double that, over 10x more??? It adds up over the years, thousands and thousands per year.\nI wouldn't have minded if everyone paid the same, but to have some people pay more, others less, even when working at the same time/year, is unfair.\nEdit: Actually I read the proposals and one of it is what I have always suggested- to phase everyone into 4.4%.  Then an unfair burden won't be just on a certain group.'"
