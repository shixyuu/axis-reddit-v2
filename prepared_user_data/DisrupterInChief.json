        "In response to 'Adding work email apps to your personal phone also opens you up to remote wiping of your device in case of separation. Itâ€™s usually buried in the terms of service, and another good reason not to do it.', a user said: 'Been in IT where I've had to remote wipe people's phone when they were let go. Most of the time it was company phones, but there were people who treated company phones like it was a personal phone. Instantly their personal contacts, photos, texts, etc... disappeared because they didn't separate work/personal boundaries. Never put my work email on personal phone since, cos I know the trigger can be pulled on me at any moment. Best to keep them separate.'"
