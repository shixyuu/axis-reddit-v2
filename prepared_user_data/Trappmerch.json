I used to have my coworkers do that same thing until one of them told me that wasnâ€™t their job and I completely agreed and apologized to them. I did what I thought was right by my bosses. After that anybody working back drive never had to do as many tasks. Make happy meal boxes and man their lane until it was time for McBakery or whatever tf they decided to call it. Pivotal point in my management experience and that earned my respect throughout the chain.'"
