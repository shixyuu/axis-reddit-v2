I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'This is a real life example of\nwhy we can't have nice things\n,\nYou have OP literally committing fraud and the companies using this as an example to force everyone else doing the right thing to RTO.\nGod forbid one day OP gets caught what do you think will happen to the rest of the staff members WFH?\nPeople that actually need to WFH and am doing a good job will be forced to RTO as they will have evidence of why WFH doesn't actually work.\nThis is antiwork subreddit not speed run to prison and ruining things for everyone else.'"
