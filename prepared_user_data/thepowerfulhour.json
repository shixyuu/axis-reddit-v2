        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I've spent the past month and a 1/2 literally doing nothing and somehow have not caught shit for it.. I'm so burnt out. I'm just kind of waiting for the day that I get put on a pip or just fired but that day still hasn't come so I'm gonna keep riding it out. I also got hit with a divorce a couple months ago so that didn't help, but I mean literally 0 effort. I show up to some internal meetings, 0 prospecting. Just take my base salary and golf or play video games all day.'",
        "In response to 'Start applying to other jobs at least. It will get you motivated to do something again and take your mind off your toxic job. Stay strong.', a user said: 'I got a new job, start next week. Leaving the remote SaaS life to go in person landscape sales. 3 preset appointments a day, only gotta close. No more cold calls.'"
