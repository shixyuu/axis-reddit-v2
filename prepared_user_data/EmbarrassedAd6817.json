        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'Yep, a few years ago!\nMy rule is, if it’s outside of my contract hours it has to either bring me joy or bring me enough money to make working late worth it. So far I’ve rarely stayed past contract.\nI do need to do some IEP meetings outside of contract, but decided not to die on that hill.\nEdit - I agree with the issues with the term “quiet quitting.” I don’t call what I’m doing quitting in any way. I work my ass off those contracted hours.'"
