        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work\nHence the term \"quiet quitting.\"'",
        "In response to 'Other countries just call that \"doing their job\"', a user said: 'Employers call it \"being lazy.\"'",
        "In response to 'Being lazy is not doing your job. If you are in fact working, then by all definitions, you aren't lazy. If you're paying me to work and I'm working, I don't see how that's laziness', a user said: 'I don't see how that's laziness\nDon't ask me, ask my manager, or your manager, or all the managers I had for the past 20 years.'"
