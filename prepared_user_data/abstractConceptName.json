        "In response to 'Oh I've been beaten down so hard by life, that I am 100% convinced that promotions, better pay, and benefits packages, are the adult equivalent of Santa Claus.  They are lies people tell other people so that the world feels less bleak.  They aren't actually real and don't actually happen to people.', a user said: 'Obviously promotions\nhappen\n, just not for the reasons you think.\nAnd I don't mean people are buying promotions with sex (although no doubt that does happen), but promotions are purely about the story you can weave about your career.\nBeing able to work hard isn't the greatest skill you can develop for yourself.\nBeing able to convince others (and knowing who to convince) that you're necessary for their future success, is.\nThe person who keeps their head down, works hard, doesn't complain?  They're exactly where they should be.\nThe person who has ideas, and can articulate them to the right people?  Let's see where you can go.'"
