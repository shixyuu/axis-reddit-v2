        "In response to 'Interestingly, this isn't what I've always been told \"working to rule\" is. My understanding of working to rule is that it's a method of protest to reduce productivity to a crawl.\nFor example, when the official procedure for a specific part of a job says \"measure the object to ensure it's within tolerance\" after you've been doing the job a while you can probably eyeball it pretty accurately. Working to rule means you follow each and every rule to the letter. So each time you need to check you go get the ruler out and measure exactly. Don't forget that oh&s usually requires you keep a clean workbench, so make sure you put the ruler back in its appropriate place when you've finished using it that time, even if that's the other end of the workshop. See a spill on the way? Don't wait for someone else to clean it, someone could get hurt.  Follow proper oh&s and go get all the appropriate safety gear and make sure it's properly signed while you clean, then make sure you clean all the equipment exactly as the guidebooks state, then return all the gear to the proper places. Get back to your station and take the next piece of work. Need to measure another piece? Guess you're going to the other end of the shop to go get that ruler you stored properly last time, etc.\nI feel this is better termed \"working to contact\" or, my favourite, \"meeting all contractual expectations\". You want me to do more? No worries, time to start a new contract and negotiate new pay terms to represent the increased workload.', a user said: 'I love this. \nYou're a menace and an absolutely brilliant one at that'"
