        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'My students are on a point system (therapeutic setting & behavioral supports). If they choose to not work they get no points, can’t make up the assignment and are asked to leave the classroom until they are ready to follow expectations of classwork.\nIMO your grades are earned. Don’t do the work, you fail.'"
