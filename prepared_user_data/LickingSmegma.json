        "In response to 'https://youtu.be/YEKYG-zvQvA?si=F6pFpJnkXbMGprt2\nThe song is called Bubamara and it was written by Nele Karajlić for the Serbian movie\nBlack Cat, White Cat\n. The movie is about gypsy community so the song is popular among gypsies worldwide. It's also popular among marching bands, so it's not that strange to hear it all the way in the US.', a user said: 'It's written by Nele Karajlić of The No Smoking Orchestra, which band collaborated with Kusturica on soundtracks and albums.\nA few bootlegs of the soundtrack wrongly list Goran Bregović as composer.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah, you're right. I actually first wrote Nele, but then googled it and it said Bregović was a writer, so I edited it (I'm gonna edit it back to Nele, my bad). It makes so much more sense that Nele wrote it since the movie has other songs performed by his band Zabranjeno Pušenje (No Smoking/Forbidden Smoking).\nIt's not that strange that people wrongly think that Bregović wrote this because he wrote songs for a few Kusturica movies.', a user said: 'I happen to be more familiar with that tune from\n‘Unza Unza Time’,\nwhich also has a bunch of other bangers. Bregović doesn't quite seem that groovy to me, which is probably why I was suspicious of his authorship here.'"
