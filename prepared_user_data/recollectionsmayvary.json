        "In response to 'I like Kamala a lot and I think she is smart, warm, and hilarious. But I agree with you that she's not a great national candidate. She is too cautious and perhaps too kind to have the killer political instincts that candidates like Obama and, in his own idiotic way, Trump have. And she seemingly couldn't bear to break from Biden as she saw it as a betrayal.', a user said: 'And she seemingly couldn't bear to break from Biden as she saw it as a betrayal.\nI wish people said the quiet part out loud on this specific talking point. I don't think it's that she couldn't bear to break away from Biden because she saw it as a betrayal. It's more that Biden didn't tell her explicitly, \"do what you have to do to win; if that means throwing me under the bus; do it twice, just for good measure-- democracy is literally at stake. you'll get no pushback from my team.\"\nBut he didn't do that and I think absent his permission, there would've been Biden loyalists who would've skewered her for weeks on making a break from him and leak stories about how aligned she was with Biden and they are \"dismayed and shocked that she's now betraying President Biden\" and further would've flamed the fires of \"she's a flipflopper with no identity.\"'",
        "In response to 'I think Biden completely let his ego and emotions get in the way, but I don't think the Biden loyalists are actually a powerful force. They're loud on X, but he was so overwhelmingly unpopular - I don't think the betrayal line would have stuck.', a user said: 'i think it's less that the betrayal would've stuck but it would've further fanned the flames of \"she's a flip flopper with no identity.\" Elements of the left and the right would've lapped it up eagerly.'"
