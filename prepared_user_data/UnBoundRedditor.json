        "In response to 'I once just walked out on a job mid shift. I was working at a small denim boutique at the start of the Great Recession. All of the tourists had disappeared and we hadn’t had a single customer in the shop for days. On this particular morning I had spent hours on my hands and knees scrubbing dust off the shop’s baseboards just to pass the time since the owner couldn’t afford a cleaning service. After three hours of this, the assistant manager walked in and immediately chewed me out over something trivial that had happened weeks before. I got up off the floor without saying a word, walked in the back, grabbed my coat and bag, and left through the back door. After about 45 minutes the jerk must have realized that I left and started blowing up my cellphone. I didn’t even bother answering. The owner and the assistant manager knew that they had treated me horribly. I never spoke to them again.', a user said: 'I was enlisting but grabbed a job with Panera to hold me over until I left for boot camp. I repeatedly told them time and time again. Don't schedule me for these days, I'm not a permanent employee, and I have random obligations that need to be met for MY goals. They would keep me way past my shift to finish food prep because they would go through so much food and only had a single prep person. Then they scheduled me for a big corporate initiation thing on a day I had obligations. I said enough is enough and slept in the next morning. I answered the call from one of the AMs and said, \"Yeah I quit, I told you guys I have obligations and you don't care about my time, bye\"\nI came in to collect my last check and was officially banned from entering that store.'"
