We're professionals, not volunteers.', a user said: 'Serious question though, (and totally sorry if my newness shows—only 1 year under my belt) but if our contract contains the statement “and other duties as assigned” under the job responsibilities portion, do we have a choice in this sort of thing?'",
        "In response to 'If your contract has a defined start and end time, the assigned duties need to happen in those times. If the contract specifies that you can be assigned duties outside of those hours, what is the point of an end time?', a user said: 'Ah, I see. I guess the duties would need to be within those times to still fall under the contract.'",
        "In response to 'You always have a choice. All of our contracts have that clause, \"and other duties\". It's not carte blanche for worker exploitation.\nIf you refuse unpaid extra duties, how will your admin respond? OP's admin stressed the dance was \"mandatory\", yet, no repercussions. Your admin might respond differently.\nYou either accept being exploited, or you don't. Working at a school that willingly exploit's its teachers like this isn't worth working for.', a user said: 'I’m currently taking one year off to be with my son born in January but left my previous school for the reasons you’re highlighting here.\nAt that school, teachers willingly signed for their time slot at homecoming, prom, sports gates, etc. so you were just viewed as the turd if you didn’t overextend like everyone else. All sorts of random things were “mandatory” for us and they’d pop up out of nowhere, but yeah, you’re right.\nI have my sights set on a school that seems to be much better for the upcoming year, I just hope that’s correct.'"
