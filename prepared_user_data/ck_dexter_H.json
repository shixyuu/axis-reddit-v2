        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'I've been in a similar position, having been passed up for a promotion, while I was doing most of those tasks... I was told that they wanted to hire someone with more experience so that they wouldn't have to spend time training someone.  I ended up training them on everything I was doing.  There were other contributing factors, but I quietly looked for another job and once I had one I quit.  If it seems like they don't value you, chances are pretty good that they don't.  And if the company is already clearing house, you may be next anyways.'"
