        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'I always called it minim pay equals minimum work ðŸ’€ if im overhere making 30 an hour best believe ima bust my ass for that 30 an hour ðŸ’€'",
        "In response to 'People have been saying this since the wage was 7.25. Not sure what your minimum wage is now but I make over 10 dollars over that here. Yet I still see people act like Walmart hasn't raised our wages at all. If you ask me, ya'll just don't want to work hard, which is fine. But just say that... And no, I'm not a bootlicker and I share the same gripes about this company as most, but pay has over doubled for almost every non-salaried position in the company in the last 5 years.', a user said: 'Everybody works how they wish and its not that i dont want to work i work fast and i do my job but when youâ€™re getting paid minimum wage for a job thatâ€™s physically demanding like factorys and knowing that it can be very dangerous you would think you would be paid a little more.'"
