        "In response to 'I had this conversation recently with my wife. There will be a huge issue because people won't have money to spend.\nFirst time in history just very recently like a few weeks ago that credit card revolving balance is for the first time higher than paid off credit cards.\nCompanies don't realize they need a customer base to buy their products and that said customers are employees of other firms....\nGonna be interesting to watch that dumpster fire once corps run out of customers because they don't give their own people money to buy from each other', a user said: 'I’ve been saying this same thing for years. It’s so mind boggling to me that our govt & corps haven’t learned after all of these “social experiments with tax payer money” that the trickle-down effect does not work to support the greater good.\nThe most obvious social experiment was during the pandemic when govt touted keeping corps & big businesses afloat by giving them money directly instead of giving enough money to the consumers to pay for said bills/products being offered by these companies. The free market/capitalism doesn’t work well if consumers can’t afford the products!'"
