Company policies and practices have changed over the course of our lifetime (e.g. no more pensions, few retirement benefits, limited raises that do not match cost of living increases, etc.) and we have to evolve to match this new environment. You adapted. You didn't quit.', a user said: 'This is such a good point. I’ve been rated as “exceeds expectations” every year since 2017 and every year I get the same shitty 2.5% raise as everyone else. There is nowhere to go up the ladder besides management and fuck that noise. So if I begin only “meeting expectations,” I’m still doing just fine. I’m doing exactly what’s expected. 🤷🏻‍♀️'"
