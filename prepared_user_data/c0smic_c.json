        "In response to 'Are any managers on here?\nMy entire team plus dependent teams have quietly quit.  Makes getting anything done a real headache. No one willing to do anything more than the minimum.\nThese are well remunerated staff members with heaps of flexibility.\nPeers initially did soul searching until we realised impossible to change mindsets. Quietly gave up.', a user said: 'Me. I manage a very small team of two, and then I’ve got two people above me (in a small org of 25 people we are far too top heavy) and my managers are the absolute freaking worst. \nThey suck at communicating but think telling me to tell my staff members to “support other staff” is managing/communicating? Avoid any type of difficult convos, expect everyone to just adapt to change with no comms around it, will send wanky corporatespeak emails about leadership - but not step in or provide guidance when it’s needed but will then claim they are “empowering” us when they stay silent when in actual fact they are just screwing us over. \nI hate it here ☹️'"
