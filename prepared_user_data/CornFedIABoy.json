        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Vivek Ramaswamy 'quiet quitting' his campaign? It sure seems so. [External Link]: https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ramaswamy-2024-presidential-election-campaign-rcna131919', a user said: 'He’s got a full slate of scheduled events here in Iowa through this weekend, up to six a day.  That doesn’t look like quitting to me.  Obviously going off air is a good sign he’s out of other people’s money, but if he was really ready to quit he wouldn’t be doing the Pizza Ranch circuit in rural Iowa counties.'",
        "In response to 'I have a hunch he will drop out and endorse trump right before Iowa, or at least right afterwards.\nHe’s hoping for a cabinet position, not VP. Mike Johnson will get tapped for VP.\nThis is my prediction.', a user said: 'If he does the deal hasn’t been made yet.'"
