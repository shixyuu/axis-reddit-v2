Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'I don't understand why everyone is defending the customer.  Look were delivery drivers that are not that far. Usually, you get an order within a certain distance.\nThus, it isn't a delivery where we have to carry a big cargo jump to orbit and use a light ftl drive to jump to a different system while avoiding pirate attacks from different species in space.  We're literally down the street. If you order, we get an order and come.\nBe prepared to receive your delivery.'"
