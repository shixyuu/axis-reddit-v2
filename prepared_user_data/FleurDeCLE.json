        "In response to 'I've actually yelled at co-workers who were not taking their breaks.\nOur half-hour break is unpaid. So you DO NOT fucking skip it. It's fine to pospone it. If a supervisor asks you to work through it, he's asking you to break the local labor laws, and you should come tell me so I can yell at the supervisor. But take your fucking break!', a user said: 'I will work through lunch, but later in the afternoon, I will walk out and take a long break to recharge. Just some places my co workers aren’t. You don’t realize how much you need that time until you start to take it. So TAKE IT!'"
