At my old store, breaks were taken in the final available hours (first break sometimes butted up against lunch at the end of the 4th) and lunch was minutes before your 5th.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'That was life at my old store until they got rid of the registers. Then meal violations shot through the roof because there was nothing forcing associates to take their lunch, and the managers who were never up front sure wouldn't remind them. It basically became the job of the few who would do it to track everyone's lunches and tell them to go, even if it meant the bullpens would be briefly understaffed for a bit. Not-so-fond memories of being the only associate in a busy 14-register bullpen.'"
