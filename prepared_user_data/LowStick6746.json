        "In response to 'Hey, come sign our streaming contract, it will get you 50% off for the first six months! What a deal! It's a year long contract though, but think about the savings!', a user said: 'It’s not just streaming services nowadays. The store I work at introduced a subscription service a couple of years ago. You get locked in for a whole year even if you cancel. Originally we were told “don’t worry associates aren’t going to have to push it. Guess what we’ve shoving down every single cusp throat now? We’re constantly being driven on pushing this subscription service and it drives me nuts'"
