        "In response to 'Because jobs drill the \"above and beyond\" crap\nSome don't give you a raise unless you do, some make you feel bad of you dont. At least whete I'm at now there's a big bonus for going above and beyond\nIt's so annoying, we need to normalise doing your job fully but not beyond your job.', a user said: 'Most places as far as I can tell don’t give you a raise even if you do go above and beyond, and then once you scale back your effort to line up with the pay/progression they offer you act like the reason they didn’t give you a raise is because you aren’t going above and beyond.'"
