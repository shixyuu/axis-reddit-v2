I don't think the men in these scenarios actually think about the pain they are causing, they're just trying to maximize their rate of return. They have been taught and/or observed that a tolerable level of permanent unhappiness is sufficient, so that's the standard they strive for. They aren't looking to be abusive or exert control, they're looking to do the absolute bare minimum it takes to keep their bangmaid around.', a user said: 'Truly! I told my (male) partner that, \"don't worry when I'm mad, worry when I don't care.\"'",
        "In response to 'I feel like I was constantly telling my ex how miserable I was and what I needed to remain in the marriage. When I asked for a divorce he was shocked. “But we’re so happy!” he said. He told everyone I blindsided him. That I just woke up one day and told him I’d had enough. It had been years and years of “you need a job. You need to clean. You need to take care of your health. I need x, y and z.”\nBy the time I reached the point I asked for a divorce I was completely done with that marriage. Nothing he said or did would have made a difference. I think of my situation when men post on a Reddit or elsewhere about how the ex were blindsided. In their posts and comments there are always clues to the many ways they were given a heads up and chose to ignore it.', a user said: 'Omg are you me? It's like they don't listen.'"
