Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'As a customer, Doordash doesn't always send me the notifications.. like no joke... and sometimes they send the notifications like 10 minutes later. So it's good to call. You work in customer service so you should at least try calling if you're having a hard time reaching them. You're just being lazy, honestly. But you do you.'"
