Don't let it become an acceptable term [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/fwj0foce59k91.jpg', a user said: 'I worked so hard at the job I’m still at. I got a promotion to assistant manager only to be verbally and emotionally bullied and never properly taught how to do the job properly. I asked how to do things and got ignored. I had anxiety and depression before but she made it 100 times worse.\nI had multiple incidents where I had to leave to go to ER because of an unknown medical condition. (High BP due to stress and heat) took two months off and now only work two days a week. I get my tasks done and that’s it.\nHard work doesn’t get you more money. It just gives you more work.'"
