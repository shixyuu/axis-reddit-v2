        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. ðŸ’ª', a user said: 'Unfortunately Home Depot doesnâ€™t careâ€¦ if itâ€™s not corporate then you are just the pawn. I work with a person who has the best regional sales for 10 years in a row and all she got was a plaque saying great customer service. Her specialist of the month item just some cheap pots and pans was stolen by someone in Chicago. Corporate people know her and come by all time but itâ€™s just sad that she makes nearly anything from Home Depot'",
        "In response to 'My store had a PASA who was #2 in sales every year..only kept losing to a chick who had the fucking air force base in her pocket... anyway he was very well compensated in other ways via gifts and other shit from the contractors who loved him..I'm talking about trips to Mexico..cash...etc...not saying all specialist are doing this but it's not rare either', a user said: 'Shes loves by customers but she doesnâ€™t mention any customer compensation. She probably makes 25-30 hr after 20 years working but itâ€™s really not much for were we live. Thats a good wage for starters and what local places pay to start let alone having really high sales. But Home Depot likes to pay half of what youâ€™re worth. And come up with elementary school style ways of rewarding good work.'"
