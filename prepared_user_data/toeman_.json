That’s why it’s not a completely unreasonable question.', a user said: 'Yeah I can understand why OP would want to step in and say something, because obviously it's not fair for OP and the rest of their team to have to pick up the slack and take on more hours to cover for the one coworker not contributing. But at the same time, you have to be careful not to overstep boundaries especially in the workplace.\nOP if you want to say something I would suggest bringing it up to your manager privately but keep it brief. Just say that the team's been putting in more hours lately to manage the volume of tickets and you need more support or someone to help manage that workload. Let karma take care of the rest.'"
