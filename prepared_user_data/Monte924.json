COVID was the reason businesses finally allowed WFH, but once workers had it they understood they needed it for A LOT more than COVID. They needed it for their mental health; they needed it for a better work/life balance; they needed it to help take better of their kids; they need it to save money on unnecessary expenses; they needed it to avoid a pointless commute that wastes their time for no benefit for themselves. We live in the age of high speed internet and communication; a lot of work can be just as easily be done at home as it is in the office. Heck, reducing stress can actually BOOST productivity. Insisting people work in the office is more about control'",
