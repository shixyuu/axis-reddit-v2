        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: 'I’m relating to this one so many levels. This entire summer I’ve felt undervalued and overworked. My salary has increased 300 dollars over the last 4 year. I feel like I’m just expected to put in my 30 years of service, barely make an average salary and go into the night.\nI can’t pay our bills without using my credit as an extension and everything just keeps getting more expensive. The debt keeps piling up and I just see now relief from this. I didn’t think this is how things would be growing up, I wish I was more skilled and could work a job that actually made me money. They say money isn’t everything but that’s easy to say when you’re making enough of it.'"
