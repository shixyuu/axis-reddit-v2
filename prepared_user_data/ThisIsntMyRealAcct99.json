        "In response to 'Yes.  I have.  Federal worker.  I am assigned to the PNW but have no local “customers.”  I write doctrine for military units all over the world.  I was a remote worker pre COVID and have been awarded Special Operations Wing Civilian of the Year multiple times while remote working.  Now I’m being told I’m ripping off the taxpayers and lazy if I don’t return to the office.\nI did return to the office.  The telephones and internet do not work.  I now refuse to hotspot my personal phone or use my home WiFi so I literally cannot accomplish anything.  I have 700 hours of accrued leave that I am going to burn.  I will be completely inaccessible outside of normal working hours.  My minimum callback time is 2 hours.  If my supervisor contacts me at 5:05 pm, I will (and already have) be logging a 2 hour comp time request.  Every time I get a message at 6:30 am that the installation gate is closed for some random reason, that’s also a 2 hour comp time request.  My laptop will be staying at my desk so in the event of adverse weather, I will be logging admin leave instead of situational telework.   Nearly everyone in our workcenter is in the same boat and we’ve warned that it’s going to cause mission stoppage once someone gets hurt or killed because we literally cannot do our jobs.', a user said: 'Can you clarify the 700 hours of leave, is that your SL or are you some special category that can carry over more leave every year?'"
