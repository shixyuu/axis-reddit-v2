        "In response to 'Wait, doing the job you're paid for during working hours is now called \"quiet quitting\"?', a user said: 'I don't get that either. That's not quitting, that's simply work-life balance.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah, the more I hear about this quiet quitting thing, the more it just sounds like \"working to rule\". Definitely changes the connotation of what's going on.', a user said: 'I don't understand why it's called \"quiet quitting\". They're not quitting, they're working. Quiet quitting sounds like just not showing up without any kind of notice, but that's not what this is.'",
        "In response to 'I just got a 100% raise for my freelance article writing that I've been lazily pushing out, at apparently higher quality than other writers.\nThis is gonna sound crazy but I'm actually more motivated now. Fucking wild right?', a user said: 'If you want motivated workers, you've got to pay them well.'",
        "In response to 'When I first heard it, I assumed it meant subtly doing less and less work over time until you were either doing nothing or were fired.\nWhen I found out how people are actually using it, I couldn't stop laughing.  What a bunch of bourgesois propaganda.', a user said: 'I thought it meant not showing up to work without giving notice. I was disappointed when I found out it just meant doing the work you're paid to do. Working to rule is a much better description.'"
