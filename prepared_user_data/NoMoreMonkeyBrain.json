        "In response to 'I'm Korean - the work culture in East Asia is toxic as hell. Dunno if it's the same in Japan, but in Korea it's generally seen as unprofessional/disrespectful to leave the office before your boss. Consider the layers of management in a conglomerate like Samsung, and you start understanding why the birth rates are the lowest in the world. Additionally, long hours ≠ productivity, oftentimes is counterproductive if you have people just doing random shit to look busy to fill their hours because they finished their work 3 hours ago. And that's not even all - Korea also has an intense drinking culture, where work colleagues generally drink after a long day in the office.\nIt's very little surprise to me that the younger generations are snapping and revolting against this structure.', a user said: 'I'm very suspicious of this, but I've read several times over that east Asian companies will sometimes hire white people to essentially be a jester.  The 'otherness' affords a level of grace; the rudeness of saying something like \"why would we waste everybody's time by staying late when we won't be meaningfully working\" is balanced by the utility of having someone call out terrible management practices.\nI have no idea if this is true or not; it reeks of orientalism.  But at the same time, I sure do see a lot of discourse about toxic work culture.....'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: My last paycheck didn’t deposit. Hey yall!! I posted last week about how my boss blew a hissy fit when I called in once because I was grieving the loss of my dad.\nNow my last paycheck didn’t deposit this morning!! I texted my coworkers and I know at least one of them got paid. But this is a common occurrence, she always seems to fuck up payroll somehow. (This is the 7th time payroll has been fucked in the year I worked there). I’m pissed because now I have to reach out to her and I “quietly quit” so I was hoping I wouldn’t have to do that.\nSpeaking of which, I approached her about the text hoping to have a productive conversation. I took accountability for calling in after having so much time off for his hospital stay, death and funeral. She started going on about how she’s been looking for her “fourth token” meaning she has had 3 employees that work for her who are all subpar human beings, and she’s looking for a 4th person to help her run the shop/support her/be a normal human being… well I don’t feel like I’m her fourth token and I don’t want to be. So I left this letter and my key, packed my shit and didn’t go back.', a user said: 'Bruh, you gotta start reporting this to the DOL every time there's a delay.\nAlso, I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry you work for such an annoying shitstain.'"
