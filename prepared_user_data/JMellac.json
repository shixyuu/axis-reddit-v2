        "In response to 'Every company I’ve ever worked for has been in a constant state of defining and redefining their goals and responsibilities for each level so there’s always plausible deniability when you say you’re ready to move to the next level. Yet when they post new jobs, they seem to have an exact idea of what’s expected for that position. It’s all by design.', a user said: 'Years ago the company i worked for announced record setting profits in the same meeting where they let us know we did not meet the profit sharing goals even at the lowest level. A lot of employees got mad and asked to know what the goals were (goals were not shared). Company said they understood and made a traffic light to show how we were doing on next year's goals. Employees again said thats not what we want, we want to know what the goals are.\nSo the company cancelled profit sharing altogether. They never intended for the employees to acrually know the goals. Read into that what you will.'"
