        "In response to 'It boils down to greed.\nEverybody is greedy.\nYou're greedy when you want your company to pay you more, and the company is greedy when they want to pay you less. Eventually the market finds an equilibrium because people prefer exchanging value.\nSince US politics is based on bribes campaign donations from rich \"donors\", workers have no legal representation or a way to change the system other than to form unions. Unchecked late-stage capitalism allows all this corruption and greed to take place, and there are many types of economic systems that would fix these issues, but the first step is to get money out of politics.\nAgree with your premise, but not your conclusion. We need to get politics out of money, not the other way around. If the politicians have no power to tilt the scales one way or the other, then the person making the bribe has no incentive to bribe anymore, cutting off the problem at its roots.', a user said: 'You know what happens when there's no regulation or oversight? The wealthiest people have all the power, just like with feudalism. At least until the revolution phase starts.'"
