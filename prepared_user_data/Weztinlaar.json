        "In response to 'Because they expect you to do more than what's in the contract, but they refuse to write it in the contract or they'd have to give you more money and things.\nSo they can just shame and guilt you and command you, and get free work and effort from you.\nThat's how you be a team player.', a user said: 'I worked for a major Canadian university back when I was a student. The university pointed out to my manager that the students in my position didn't have job descriptions, and tasked me to write our job descriptions. I wrote down my normal tasks and submitted them to my manager, she agreed that these were my responsibilities and that it was an accurate representation of my job. She forwarded it to her superiors and it works its way up the chain and back down.\n\"If this job description is accurate then we are required to pay them at this higher rate\"\nMy manager deleted half of the job description I wrote (not even reworded to include the tasks in a different way, just wholesale highlighted 50% of the document and hit delete) and resubmitted it. I know this to be the case because she sent it from the shared department e-mail address and I came across the e-mail chain.'"
