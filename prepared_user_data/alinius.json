        "In response to 'Taking 10 is effectively what passive perception is, but for any and all skills.\nYou say that like Passive Perception is somehow unique. There are passive scores for every skill.\nTaking 20 is the version for when they character conceivably has plenty of time to roll again and again until a 20 is rolled with absolutely no downsides to failure to failing or trying again. So they just take the time and are assumed to have gotten a maximum result.\n5e has take 20 without calling it that. From the DMG:\nSometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With enough attempts and enough time, a character should eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating the check allows a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.', a user said: 'Passive perception is special because it was commonly used to take 10 in 3.x and is a passive skill in 5e, so it is the best example of the link between take 10 and passive skills.  Investigation has no equivalent skill in 3.x.  Insight is similar to sense motive in 3.x, but sense motive was most often used in situations where taking 10 was not allowed.'",
        "In response to 'Wat\nPerception wasnt a skill in 3.5. It was combined from spot and listen checks.\nSearch is a skill in 3.5. It, was used in the exact situations you would use investigate, and like investigate, its an INT skill.\nYou could almost always take 10 on sense motive. The rules for taking 10 was you couldn't do it while distracted or threatened. Most of the time you arent distracted or being attacked in a conversation.', a user said: 'Fair point, I forgot that search, spot, and listen were not combined into a single skill until Pathfinder, which my group always jokingly referred to as D&D 3.75.\nIn 3.x, search is about finding inanimate objects, which is mostly traps.  Most groups I played with took 20 more that they took 10 on search.  Search in 3.x is part of perception in 5e.  Investigate is \"finding obscure information in books and understanding how things work\" which is completely different from 3.x search.\nMaybe table specific.  At our table, it was assumed that any opposed roll counted as being under threat and thus could not take 10.  Even if the threat was not physical, you are face to face with another person who could react negatively to a failed opposed roll.'",
        "In response to 'Different editions anyways, but in 3.5 taking 10/20 had specific times attached, so being able to do so in an action would still be valuable.', a user said: 'Take 10 was same amount of time as rolling, but could not be used under pressure or if distracted.'"
