        "In response to 'In retail, \"Quiet Firing\" happens all the time. You don't like the employee for whatever reason, you just schedule them little to no hours until they leave. I've seen it happen so many times.', a user said: 'This happened to me when I worked at Target. They tried to pass it off as \"Well, we don't give anyone but supervisors 30 hours and only managers get 40 hours, that's just how it works here\" when I pointed out that I was hired on the promise of getting 40 hours per week. Over the course of a year, my hours were lowered again and again until, the week after I put in my two weeks notice, I was scheduled for four hours across two days. Gave up and quit on the spot, even after the manager I told I was quitting said \"You know you'll be blackballed from ever working here again, right?\" Bitch, I don't want to work here\nnow\n. Why would I want to work here in the future?\nSide note, I didn't put in my two weeks because of the low hours. I did so because I got yelled at by my supervisor\nin front of customers\nfor asking a coworker to not say \"that's so gay\". Coworker claimed I had yelled at her and instead of getting my side of things or, I don't know, checking the goddamn cameras, supervisor chose verbal violence for whatever reason.'"
