        "In response to 'I think it depends on the field\nI strategically choose situations when to go above and beyond especially if it makes an impression and with the plan to reference it for raise discussions. When I do I make it clear that in that moment I went above and beyond but not to expect it as norm, with the assumption being a raise or promotion will motivate me to show them that part more\nMy bosses have always complemented my firmness and strict work life balance. It’s the same boundary setting that makes me successful with our clients\nNot many people know how to stand up for themselves, and worse, many jobs punish those that do', a user said: 'I like how you put it with strategically choosing. That’s what I’ve learned over my career. Going full out 100% of the time will get you no where. You need to know when to run and when to walk.\nI think many people follow a similar arc in their career. When you first start you bust ass to make a good impression. But over the years you realize it doesn’t get you much. Then you start backing off a bit and you find out that you’re actually still getting the exact same praise and kudos as you did before even though you aren’t trying as hard.'"
