        "In response to 'I hate how they call it \"quiet quitting.\" Like simply working the hours you paid is the same as straight up quitting and being unemployed.', a user said: 'Exactly! Deciding to only work within your specified work hours isn't quitting--it's doing your damn job! I hate that so many of my coworkers think that they aren't working hard enough if they aren't available all of the time. Not me! I do my job when I'm at work, but when I'm at home, I'm at home. I don't feel guilty that I don't respond to a colleague's 10:30 PM text or check my work email over the weekend. When did we get to the point that work is supposed to take up your whole life?'"
