        "In response to 'I learned it watching my boomer mom work full time for half time hours. After 35 years she got those extra hours, for 5 years before she retired.\nI don't do anything extra as a rule UNLESS they are a good employer and I know they will have my back when I need it. However, those employers are few and far between in my experience but I also spent half my work in the public sector where wages/work do not mingle, just time spent.', a user said: 'Sometimes I do extra because of the co-workers I have, but that's more of a worker's comraderie, really. My work friends! Or perhaps...Comrades would be the better term. :)'"
