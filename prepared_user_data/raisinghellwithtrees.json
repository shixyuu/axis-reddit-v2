        "In response to 'Sadly, you are correct. I learned this the hard way. Busted my ass last year, achieved all my goals and really felt I deserved a 4/5 or 5/5 rating, but since the company/ industry is in a slump, only a very tiny percentage of people in the company were rated 5/5 and everyone else got 3/5 and a shitty raise. I've never felt more discouraged. I have a ton of PTO and am remote, as a result I do have a nice work-life balance, so I guess it's time to quiet quit / coast another 10-12 years until retirement.', a user said: 'I worked for a poorly-run company that had to lay off one third of its workers. We all worked hard to pick up the slack. The accountant faxed over the quarterly earnings sheet which declared we made a profit that quarter. Word spread quickly and since we had a profit sharing model, we were looking forward to a bonus. Even if it was small it'd be some kind of reward for everyone working their butts off.\nThe accountant president of the company announced that contrary to popular rumor, we hadn't made a profit due to depreciation of equipment which wasn't factored into the earnings report. That demoralized just about everybody, who quit within a couple of months. The biz declared bankruptcy in six. What a shit hole.'"
