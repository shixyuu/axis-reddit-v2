        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone in the process of “quiet quitting”? I’ve been at my job for 9 years. I work in a department where I get swamped daily and have been under staffed since covid. I’m burned the fuck out. I’ve asked management and HR for help to no avail. I dread every day I wake up knowing I have to go to work.\nI’ve tried to pare back my work load myself but my work ethic is too strong to just go in and dog it but now I’m to point where I don’t care. I make great money and the benefits are probably some of the best in the country but I’m not happy at all. I’ve looked at applying other places and have had call backs but I couldn’t pull the trigger and leave.\nI’ve heard of quiet quitting where you just go in and do the bare minimum. Knowing my employer they either won’t bat an eye or they will come to me and wonder why I’m not laying waste to any and all tasks like I used to which would be a mistake on their part as that would piss me off lol. Has anyone done quiet quitting or currently doing that?', a user said: 'Every year they tell me they want me to adopt new xyz processes on top of existing workflow. Along with new personal goals and rto bullshit policies. I just nod along. Not going to happen.\nLongtime veteran QA supporting 30 devs across three large scrum projects. I’m planning to retire next summer and they know this. I am basically unmanageable now and do whatever I want. Fortunately they have little leverage.'"
