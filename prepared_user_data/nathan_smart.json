By the end of that job, I didn't give two flying hoots about anything\nMy next job (didn't get fired from last one, just left), I give a healthy 70%. I can ramp it up during high stress needs if needed, but I just maintain a 70% effort level. I also have days where it's a 50%.\nIt's just removing yourself slowly from an over loaded work environment, imo', a user said: 'That sounds like way more than 100%'"
