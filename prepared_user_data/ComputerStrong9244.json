        "In response to 'Who the fuck is emotionally connected to their work?', a user said: 'Sarcastic but true answer: All those weirdos on LinkedIn who post about how they wake up at 4am because they can't wait to feel capitalism throbbing inside of them. They have fake made-up job descriptions and are CEO's of a company with 1 employee.\nActual answer: You can feel connected to a job that matters, or things you'd do for free but get paid for. I take care of dogs, that makes me happy. I have no boss, that makes me even happier.\nThe kind of jobs this article talks about? Nobody fucking cares about those jobs.'",
        "In response to 'I'm my cousin's nanny and his grandma's errands runner. It's pretty damn cool even if sometimes I feel like a donkey or Cinderella, hauling heavy loads or staying up past midnight finishing some housework.\nLiterally don't think it'd be possible to pay me enough to do this kinda stuff for strangers who clearly feel I'm beneath them.', a user said: 'I've had to get a little snippy with people who are used to barking orders at subordinates taking a fucking\ntone\nwith me. I tell them in a jokey way I don't work for them, we're coworkers whose job is to take care of Princess Pookie-kins. If they still have a stick up their ass after that, we can't work together.\nI'll move heaven and earth and work 24 hours straight for a client I like (for example, taking a dog to an emergency vet when parents are out of town), but the second someone thinks they own me because they know how to use Venmo, I've got other places to be.'"
