        "In response to 'Yeah. I worked five minutes past when I’m supposed to log off to finish up a project yesterday. I’m salary so I don’t see how it would matter to anyone else, but my boss scolded me when she got an email notification that I had finished the project. She also keeps reminding me to hurry up and use all my PTO before the year ends. Love this woman.', a user said: 'Lol, I got similarly scolded the other day. I sent an email at like 6:12, we clock in at 6:30. My boss messaged me all, what time did you come in?? I said I hadn't clocked in yet and I was just preparing the report so I could see what my day looked like. He was like, that's worse, only do work you're paid for.'"
