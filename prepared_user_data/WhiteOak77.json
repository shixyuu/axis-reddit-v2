        "In response to 'Since interest rates forced companies to use profitability instead of hype to borrow money, everyone has been on a quest to max out RPE (Revenue Per Employee).\nRevenue per employee—calculated as a company's total revenue divided by its current number of employees—is an important ratio that roughly measures how much money each employee generates for the firm.\nIf you have 5 people generating 20(x), but cost 1(x) - well jackpot. Traditional companies are using BIG TECH tactics to make billions with a few (hundred or thousand) employees. That’s why you see no one getting hired after the let go. They are finding ways to automate (using IT DevOPs) or have customers self help using documentation.\nChatGPT gave corporations the excuse to let go and have you pair with the computer to get work done faster.', a user said: 'This was my knee jerk reaction. Record growth and massive expectations over the next 2 years plus a reduction in staff? Sounds like a recipe for failure, burnout and \"retooling\" at the end of next year.\nRight now I do the jobs of 3 people. Daily i see things fall off my plate because I can't handle mich more. Management refuses to hire any supprt.'"
