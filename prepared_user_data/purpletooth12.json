        "In response to 'Not by US standards, or Canadian ones, but universal / international ones.\nMedia Bias Fact Check, which is plenty reliable, says the following:\n“CBC’s straight news reporting is consistently low-biased, factual, and covers both sides of issues. Editorially, the opinion pages tend to be balanced with some stories leaning left, such as this: […] and right-leaning: […] Opinion pieces have also been critical of liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On the whole, slightly more opinion pieces favor the left.”\nYou seem to agree with all of that, BUT the last sentence?\nI’ve been listening to CBC every day for my entire adult life, but I am conscious of what I’m hearing, and the occasional centre-left tilt. Definitely NOT right leaning (which was my original point.)\nLikewise, the LPC (the so-called “natural governing party”) is centre-left. We don’t actually have a centrist and/or moderate party in this country, maybe we used to, not anymore.\nThe left-right spectrum is a simplification, absolutely, and any nuance is lost, but really in most cases it’s a pretty good one.\nAlso… poorly sourced? What other sorts of sources would you have liked to see? Did you even read?', a user said: 'Key part of the media bias fact is \"opinion pieces\". An opinion piece is just that, an opinion.\nSure some people get into the \"I identfy as abc, or feel xyz etc.\" but doesn't make it true or factual.'"
