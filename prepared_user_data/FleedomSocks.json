        "In response to 'I actually got fired for this last week. A new sales manager was hired and had one on ones with the sales team. I let him know that this job isn’t my entire life and my family and life outside of work is my priority. I said I will do the job and I will do it well and make you money but I’m here to do a job and go home. He didn’t like that so a week later I was fired for “not a culture fit.”', a user said: 'I'd be on the phone with the labor department asap'"
