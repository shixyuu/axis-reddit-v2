At some places it is far easier to get a senior level promotion approved than an additional head count. And then you add in stacked ranking for the yank and rank HR process. So the logical choice if you need more experienced/skilled staff is to promote past the skill level, then at the next six month review pip the person. Then at the years end fire them.
