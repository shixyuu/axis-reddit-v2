        "Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?",
        "In response to 'I've literally always just done my job, only going \"above and beyond\" when it was to make my own job easier. But I have found ways to tone it down even more since the rto mandate.', a user said: 'Do you think a lot of people will \"tone it down\" to punish their companies for RTO?'",
        "In response to 'Why is this bad?  No one mentions Quiet Payroll.  I always see exactly what is owed, never a little extra, like 5 cents even.', a user said: 'No one said it was bad. I was asking people's thoughts on this approach versus outright quitting.'"
