        "In response to 'One coworker used to comment how amazing it was that I walked out at 3:00 every day. She made it sound like I must be super organized and had my work done. No, I just left it there. The comment also had an edge to it, like me leaving “so early” was somehow sketchy. Duty day/contract hours, if it can’t get done then, it’s not getting done. Fuck the martyrs.', a user said: 'Those types of teachers, the ones who are always there to work for free, do so much damage to the profession.\nOur school has a Saturday school program for kids who are behind. It is actually about $$$ though because we can get attendance money from the state for the kids that show up.\nWhen it started, the principal at the time expected teachers to work for 4 hours on Saturday for free. He wanted at least 1 teacher from each department and, of course, there were teachers willing to do it, \"for the kids.\"\nBut the rest of us said Hell no. We got the union involved and got paid for it.  But I told those teachers that they could still choose to not do a timesheet if they didn't feel they should get paid'"
