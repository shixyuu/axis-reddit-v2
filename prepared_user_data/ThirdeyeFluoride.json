I never sign up for extra hours. And the couple times a coworker texted me about work when I'm at home I nipped it and told her to email me at work. She attempted few more times after so I ignored and deleted her texts. She finally got the hint\nEven had the department manager\nhint\nI stay for meetings after my shift. Told her can't and left.', a user said: 'Same situation with my old coworkers. Ignored them long enough or stated I can’t. Then one day she texts me hinting I’m gonna get jumped at work for her shifts. Spoke to my boss, she giggled and said, “oh, she’s probably just joking”. No longer work in that toxic environment. Prefer corporate work than “we’re a family” work.'"
