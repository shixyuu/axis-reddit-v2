        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Can we stop acting like this is a legitimate term and not just a way for crappy employers to shame workers?'",
        "In response to 'I made a comment already, but Google Work to Rule. Quiet Quitting is absolutely based on a legitimate union strategy', a user said: 'The tactic is real, but the phrase \"quiet quitting\" turns it into a bad thing and shifts the blame onto the workers.'",
        "In response to 'Thank you! When I first heard it I legitimately thought it was just people actually quitting their jobs without notice. People being outraged over everyone just doing the job they’re paid for is fucking stupid.\nHonestly though, it almost makes me think that that’s what it is. Media companies trying to act like this is some huge thing to stir up shit and keep us fighting each other and not large corporations and the wealthy like we should be.', a user said: 'IMO that's exactly what is happening'"
