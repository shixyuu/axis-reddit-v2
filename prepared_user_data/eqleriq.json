        "In response to 'Original Post: Homer Simpson (1995) explaining quiet quitting 27 years before people thought quiet quitting was a new thing. [External Link]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYXzHjbfMDk', a user said: 'That's not what quiet quitting is.\nQuiet quitting is only working during work time and basically plug-pulling as soon as the work time ends, ignoring those 5:15 emails and requests, and not doing anything more than the minimum requirements of the job.\nIt has nothing to do with \"working half-assed,\" it is pushing back from the idea that WFH means you're on call 24/7 because someone dicked around during work hours and is making up for it outside of those hours.'"
