        "In response to 'I don’t know why you’re pretending that she had low charisma, she objectively didn’t. You’re telling me the person in these videos had low charisma:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4N1VGw/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4L3qnr/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4LouPk/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4NMNjo/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTY4LEXMe/\nLike there’s a lot you can criticize her for, but lack charisma isn’t one. I get that maybe you fell for the propaganda or bias, but if you actually scrutinize her when she’s out in public she’s just objectively genuine and charismatic. Like I honestly don’t see how anyone not coming from bias could say otherwise when it’s so obvious to someone with eyes.\nPoint to other politicians that produce content like this - it’s Obama, Trump and Harris. Could add AOC to that list. I’ve yet to find someone that was actually willing to say this is mid tier politicking you see from other candidates - it’s not.\nBarack Obama was a fantastic speaker. Michelle Obama is a much better speaker than her husband but doesn’t want to go into politics, which is fair. In flat-out speaking ability, Harris is probably in the bottom 25% of the Dem party.\nHarris literally had the second best speech at the DNC, after Michelle. Stop with this nonsense.\nShe did phenomenal and she ran a historic campaign because she’s historically talented. That doesn’t mean she should run in 2028, but we need to be honest. Obama’s got it. Trumps got it. Harris has it. She lost because she ran against someone who had it, not because she lacked it. Any other boilerplate Republican she would have beat.', a user said: 'She objectively had low charisma as we can see because she could not carry a message. No one knew what her campaign was about. Obama: “change we can believe”. Trump: “make America great again”. The American people know what those things mean, they’re more than just slogans. That’s political charisma.\nWhat did Kamala have? Brat? Coconut tree?'"
