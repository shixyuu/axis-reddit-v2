        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: '‚Äúgreat question, I‚Äôll have a look into that‚Äù ‚Äú thanks for the reminder, I was waiting to hear back from somebody on this‚Äù etc basically don‚Äôt do anything until somebody follows up with you, that way you‚Äôll figure out what of your work is actually important'",
        "In response to 'I love that. Don‚Äôt do anything until someone follows up. I always thought most tasks die on their own if you ignore them properly. The trick is not to be rude while doing this I guess?', a user said: 'Exactly, pay attention to what and how people ask for things, it can be more important than the task itself, you will soon see other people in your workplace are employing exactly the same tactic or reverse will tell everyone how busy they are and look a little stressed so that people don‚Äôt give them more work.'"
