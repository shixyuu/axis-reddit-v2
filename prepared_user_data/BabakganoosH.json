        "In response to 'The term is a misnomer started in a TikTok video that went viral and was picked up by the media. It is actually a concept called Work to Rule which is the concept that you just do the bare minimum for what you are paid to do and do not go above and beyond. In the US, though, work culture has been formed to expect employees to go \"above and beyond\" and we as workers have been conditioned to grind and do the most. People are discovering that all that hard work and sacrifice is only getting us more work and no more pay. Now that people are just doing what they are paid to do, corporations and businesses are panicking because they are losing productivity and the free labor they are used to having. We are all saying, no. We aren't working for free anymore.', a user said: 'I prefer the term \"Act your wage\"'",
        "In response to 'A few of us have pay structures that incentivize caring about the job outside of the normal day and on weekends. Those are the directors and high level management where a significant part of pay is based on performance and it's likely 200k+.\nThen there is my pay structure that's 90% salary and 10% bonus. Thatll get me to answer the phone for a few hours after the normal day to triage but not fix any issues provided it's once or twice a month tops. Weekend work? Nope unless it was planned and I had enough notice to adjust my weekends\\get a comp day. I still won't work more than 40-44 hours on a normal week.\nThen there is salary with no bonus incentives...what reason would you give free labor especially if the salary is under 80k.', a user said: 'Every few months, I have 2 weeks of on-call where I have to be available by phone for emergencies 24/7. I get time and half for any work done but nothing for being on call itself.'"
