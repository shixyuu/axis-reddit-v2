I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'You ever think theres a counter weight somewhere in your company, of multiple people working very hard that you are taking advantage of?\nIts not all about the people at the very top.'"
