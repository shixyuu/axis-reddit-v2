        "In response to 'thats how I was at my first job as a project lead. always going above and beyond. and the project manager loved me for it. but when it came time to promote, I was always skipped as I was pulling most of the weight on the team and me moving up would make the team look bad. So I applied to other positions in the same company. Was a step down in title, but a step up in pay and I wasn't working 60 hours a week every week anymore. After our bounces were messed with. Found myself looking again.  This time It was a 2 step up in titles and pay. Moved up to being a project manager that is known to get projects back on track and rebuilding failing teams. Took a position Back at first company. but I am now 3 levels over My old boss who wouldn't promote me. There are still people I know from my first team that hasn't moved up in any real way. There, Managers, have them doing way more than their scope for less than half the money that all those things add up to. Thanks to covid there have been alot of lean changes happening and many shitting managers and project managers are gone now. If you make a mangers look too good, they will just keep slamming you with more and more work.', a user said: 'A great example of the unfortunate fact that most of us have to change companies in order to move up significantly'"
