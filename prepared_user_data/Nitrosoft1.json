        "In response to 'It's also called Work to Rule. No more, no less than expected.', a user said: 'About 15 years ago I worked at Target in the backroom doing hourly pulls.  After constant micromanagement as well as extra work being commanded of us with no extra pay, my other backroom coworkers and I decided to have a \"by the book and to the T\" day.  All rules followed, no cut corners, done everything that was asked of us.  It was malicious compliance.  The store was chaos by mid-day.  It took about a week to get back on track.  The inventory control system was more fucked than usual.  The managers didn't know what hit em.  This taught me that any job done to the letter of the law is typically going to produce less value than a job done the right way as learned by the workers.  It's very much like when Mike Rowe learned how to castrate lambs.  How it's taught versus what actually works is vastly different.'"
