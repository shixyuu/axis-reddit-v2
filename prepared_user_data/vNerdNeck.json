        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone else's departments like completely falling apart due to people quitting / quiet quitting? We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: 'If you think 120K is a lot of managing Azure,  you need to start shopping around.\nThis is the part that most companies don't want to accept, when you move critical infra to Azure, GCP or AWS, guess fucking what? You are no longer gonna be able to hire a \"cheaper\" admins (who, honestly, with inflation are probably or should be looking for similar salaries).\nYou're no looking for a \"cloud engineer or Cloud Admin\" and so are all the big companies want these folks and your gonna have to compete.  The coming recession is gonna hurt the folks trying to make their bones, the ones that already have are still gonna be in demand (and your gonna pay for it).'"
