        "In response to 'If I'm getting paid to do it all, I most certainly will. Otherwise you can fuck right off.\nAs a tradesman that often gets the old \"while your here could you just look at this wee job?\" I find that answering back \"sure once I finish the current priced job, I'll take a look at that and give you a quote to fix\" generally cuts them off short', a user said: 'How should I ask you to “just look at this wee job” in a way that makes it obvious I’m not expecting you to do it for free? We’re in exactly that situation right now where someone’s given us an estimate and is coming back in a few days, but we’ve noticed something else in the meantime. Might literally be a three minute job, might not.\nDo we just need to say “can we get a quote on this while you’re here”, then he can decide whether to wrap it into what he’s already doing? Or something else?'",
        "In response to 'That's exactly what you say. \nSorry while I've got you here, there's this tiny job we'd like you to have a look at cause we didnt notice it before and give us a price.\n 9/10 times I'll do it or only add £5 if it truly is small. If I think it'll be larger I'll tell you straight out and price it.', a user said: 'Good. That’s what we were gonna say, I’m glad that puts us in the “not dicks” category!'"
