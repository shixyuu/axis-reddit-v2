Only way to really get a pay increase is to leave for a new job.\nI just hope the pendulum eventually swings back to employees.', a user said: 'Back in my commuting days, I had an unpredictable commute. So I would get in early. I’d get some personal stuff done or catch up on some work stuff while I had my breakfast.  Problem was that my boss started calling or messaging me an hour before my scheduled starting time or even earlier for urgent tasks and I’d still get stuck late and or have to work through lunch.  I was exempt so no overtime. And then she started calling me on weekends.\nI eventually got very burned out.  I won’t log in early. Of course wfh is a more predictable commute! Which helps.\nBut I learned my lesson after being woken up on a Sunday around 10am on one of the rare weekend days I’d managed to sleep.'"
