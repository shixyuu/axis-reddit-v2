        "In response to '> What is your opinion?\nMy opinion is that \"quietly quitting\" is the stupidest possible name for \"continuing to do your job to a sufficient level that might not get you promoted but doesn't get you fired\". It is also called \"doing your job\". It is absurd to try to craft a narrative around averagely-motivated people staying in their jobs as \"quitting\", its the opposite.\nCEO: thank you zilla for your many years of loyalty and work, which was a bit mediocre tbh but hey so are most people, here is your gold watch.\nMe, age 65: ha ha ha I 'quietly quit' 30 years ago and never told you.\nCEO: *shrugs* whatever gets you through the day old man', a user said: 'Surprised this comment is so low, literally first thing I thought of after reading the definition. All it does is make it easier to misinterpret/attack what is basically just regular work/life boundaries. Such a ridiculously bad name.'"
