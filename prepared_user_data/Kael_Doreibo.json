        "In response to 'Well, I see some of you haven't been in the business world long.  It is the exception rather than the rule to have actually read the fucking material which will be discussed in the meeting.\nNow, I've been on both sides... The one thing I was known for in meetings was limiting the scope and time.  \"Your question doesn't pertain to what we are trying to decide here... Follow up later.\" Sometimes I didn't have time to read critical material... Because I was stuck in meetings most of the day.\nI totally don't blame OP.', a user said: 'New to corporate here but old to management fuck ups on both ends.\nKey here is to retort unprofessionalism with utmost professionalism. It's hard but it's the best option. Tell them that you don't have time to discuss the issue/that question during the presentation and that you'll 'try' to answer questions at the end of your presentation. Oh you ran out of time. You can direct questions to my email and I'll answer as soon as possible.\nProceed to quit then.\nIt's hard especially when OP had put so much work and been under so much stress and anxiety as of late but it's something to take going forward. If in doubt, give yourself time and space so you can answer properly later or at least strategise.'",
        "In response to 'Agreed. Can't blame OP but can also understand someone not getting round to tons of pre-reads. Sounds like all the bureaucracy of the process is a big part of the problem. I'm sure OP wouldn't have responded the same if they didn't have to wait 83 days to have this meeting. And if everyone else's presentations are the same length that's 12 different topics that person needs to pre-read. Hell after 3 hours you could have forgotten what you did read', a user said: 'That wasn't the right place to question him though. Especially since he hadn't even finished the presentation. If some one hasn't read the documents or forgotten them, they shouldn't ask questions until afterwards. Least of all interrupt the ongoing presentation.\nBut you have to deal with rude and sometimes stupid people all the time. How you deal with them is important. Delay questions, give yourself more time, strategise and prepare, then action. Works for both sides, OP and the committee member. It also applies for a lot of situations when you don't know what to do or how to answer.'"
