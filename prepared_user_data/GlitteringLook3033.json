Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'I started doing this because other people I work with were doing the bare minimum and still getting the same raises as I was while I was doubling or tripling their output.\nNow I go to work, get all of my work done within 3-4 hours, then I sit on my ass for the other half of the night and no one ever questions why I didn't get more done.'"
