        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'My advice as another person who struggles with people-pleasing reflexes would be to start with the \"soft no.\"\nE.g. \"Sure, I could get it done but I'm a bit busy. I might be able to do it next week or the week after.\" Deploy this one on folks who seem to expect a quick turnaround, and you'll start getting fewer requests and they probably won't even notice. Offer meeting availability requests further and further ahead of time (block off your calendar if you have to)\nIf you're bad off enough that you've been working overtime to accommodate these requests, then make sure you always have \"plans\" after work.\nThen that becomes in a few weeks \"I'd love to, but I'm doing X for Y right now.\" Name-drop your supervisor and whatever task you're working on for them whenever you can.'"
