I had to unfollow/mute some of my peers on social media who turned being a corporate slave into a personality trait. Like, if may bagong post/IG story sila there's a pretty good chance that it's work-related. Sometimes they'd also brag about how busy/stressed they are, \"hustle culture\", and all that. It's so annoying.'"
