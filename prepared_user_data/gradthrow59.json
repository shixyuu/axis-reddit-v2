There are many SCOPUS-indexed journals that are ready to publish not-so-great results.', a user said: 'this narrative gets old to me. not many real journals (i.e., a journal accepted by Clarviate/Journal Citation Reports) publish papers with only or primarily negative data. even at the lowest tier, 99% of publications report a positive finding.\nmany predatory journals are indexed by SCOPUS, that designation is meaningless.'",
        "In response to 'In my field, null-hypothesis results are also considered valuable and publishable.  It's obviously not ideal for the authors, but the null studies help inform future work, so it's worth getting it out there for it to be searchable and citable. Of course, it's important that the authors at least attempt to explain the null result.\nFrankly, a part of me feels more inclined to trust a researcher that reports a p=0.08 or something like that, especially if they critically evaluate their own study.  I always get suspicious when I see super grandiose statements accompanied by a classic p=0.05 or \"approaching significance\" at like p=0.06.', a user said: 'You may find them important and valuable, but this doesn't change the fact that what I said is true: \"not many real journals (i.e., a journal accepted by Clarviate/Journal Citation Reports) publish papers with only or primarily negative data.\"\nIf in your field, null-hypothesis results are publishable, I'd be interested to see some examples.'"
