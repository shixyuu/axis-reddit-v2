        "In response to 'As a recent grad who started a career this year, I'm so confused by \"quiet quitting\" and why anyone would be upset at it. I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'It’s because what you are doing isn’t quiet quitting , it’s just called working. The term has been bastardized.\nThere are corporate jobs where there is no time clock and your outputs are much harder to measure. Doing the minimum here is probably closer to working 5 hours a week. Employer may or may not know they are underperforming but they will continue to collect paycheck until fired because they don’t want the job anyways. This is quiet quitting.\nI also don’t see anything wrong with this by the same logic as the original post, unless it’s a small industry and you need another job in it'"
