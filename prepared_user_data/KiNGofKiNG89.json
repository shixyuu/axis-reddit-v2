        "In response to 'From what I gather, \"Quiet Quitting\" means not donating extra time to the company for free, just to maintain some sort of \"warm and fuzzy feelings\" from management. God forbit folks do what they were hired (and agreed) to.\nThere is a school of thought that says workers who dedicate all their time/life to a company are rewarded, and while this may have been true decades ago or in a few minority companies, the vast majority of companies will happily burn down employees, toss them aside when no longer useful, and hire new younger models. This simply isn't true any longer and employees are treated like shot or replaced on the whims of the executive suite.', a user said: 'You are rewarded though. It’s called a paycheck. \nI can’t grasp the concept of quiet quitting. It’s always been: \nI clocked in, what do want me to do!\nI can clean toilets with a tooth brush, I can balance the accounting books, I will even perform surgery if needed.\nAbout 5 years ago, when I give people their yearly review, I started giving them a copy of their job description too. Just to refresh themselves if they wanted too.'",
        "In response to 'Do you get your good boy head pats from your superiors too?', a user said: 'Yes I do! It’s usually the people below me that show the appreciation for the help.\nI’m here to help, regardless of what it is.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'That’s an awful mindset. I bet I can find it in your job description. Most people don’t realize how flaw proof they are.'"
