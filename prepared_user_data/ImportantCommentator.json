If so I would start by refusing to do any work on the weekends unless it’s critical. Then the next month stop working in the evenings as well. When management asks about it, just say you were working on the evenings and weekends but now you’ve started to seek a better work life balance.', a user said: 'Because a lot of poor managers ride the coattails of their best employee.'",
        "In response to 'Sure but it’s not in the managers best interest to put that employee on PIP just because he goes back down to a normal work ethic. How would that benefit the manager?', a user said: 'If they are poor managers, it's likely that they are rash instead of rational, eh?'",
        "In response to 'True. I see it as a scare tactic. “You better keep giving us your 100%, near burnout level or else!”', a user said: 'Yeah, I've seen managers try it, but they normally don't push once you call their bluff.  They'll normally work to resolve why you no longer want to work as hard.  Most people aren't that stupid.'"
