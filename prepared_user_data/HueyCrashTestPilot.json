        "In response to 'Good fucking point. Never really thought about it like this and I'm one to make sure I have a good work life balance. Damn.', a user said: 'It doesn't though. It refers to the state of the 'Work-Life Interface' where the two are in equilibrium.\nI think the problem is that people use WLB to refer to the overall system that is the WLI. And when used like that it, as Zaorish9 pointed out, doesn't make any sense at best, and at worst, gives the entire process a fairly negative spin.\nI should also mention that WLB is also frequently referred to as 'Work-Life Harmony' which I think makes a bit more sense.\nEdit: A link for the curious.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work%E2%80%93life_interface\nWork–life interface is the intersection of work and personal life. There are many aspects of one's personal life that can intersect with work including family, leisure, and health. Work–life interface is bidirectional; for instance, work can interfere with private life, and private life can interfere with work. This interface can be adverse in nature (e.g., work–life conflict) or can be beneficial (e.g., work–life enrichment) in nature.[1] Recent research has shown that the work–life interface has become more boundaryless, especially for technology-enabled workers.[2]\nWork–life balance is the equilibrium between personal life and career work.'"
