        "In response to 'I don't think so.  doing your job is exactly that.  doing your job.  When did we start shaming people for just doing their job?  quiet quitting is more when they do less and hope they get away with it or they are sending out resumes without saying anything.', a user said: 'No, quiet quitting comes from the culture of people doing way more than they job quitting the extra stuff and just doing their job. That’s why it’s called quiet quitting, it’s not quitting the whole job, just quietly quitting all the extra stuff.\nDoing less than your job is actually looking to quit.\nYou can totally quite quit and look for another job. But you will likely get fired if you don’t do your job,'"
