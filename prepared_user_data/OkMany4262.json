        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'Initially, be heard to say things like ‚Äògosh it‚Äôs hectic‚Äô and ‚Äòif only I had two pairs of hands‚Äô while keeping up to your previous levels, then gradually, start the apologetic ‚Äòoh, look, I‚Äôm project A and then B is tomorrow- I could give you 15-20mins on day 3 if that‚Äôs better than nothing‚Ä¶over the course of a month, scale back your willingness to your job description.\nIf you routinely work late, reduce it over the same period and be leaving on time.\nIf people notice, just say you‚Äôve been scheduling things more carefully/accurately or thanks for noticing my efficiency (with a shit eating grin)'"
