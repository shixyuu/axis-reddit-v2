        "In response to 'In marriage circles it's called \"walkaway wife.\"', a user said: 'I kind of hate this term and the quit quitting wife the OP mentioned because it holds the husband to seemingly no accountability. It was the wife who chose to leave. It was the wife who decided to end the marriage. It doesn't describe the low/non-existent effort of their partner or do the wife any justice.\nUnless there is a complimentary term I'm just unaware of?'",
        "In response to 'I actually see it as reclaiming agency and power. \"Quiet quitting\" is reclaiming\nyour\ntime and energy, and setting the boundaries about how\nyou\nwill dispense and disperse these valuable resources that rightfully belong to you, instead of people-pleasing leading to resentment.\n\"Walkaway\", for me, carries those same connotations. It says, \"I am re-prioritising myself and re-asserting/re-assuming ultimate say over how I distribute\nmy own internal resources\n, i.e.\nmy\ntime,\nmy\nlife force,\nmy\nheadspace,\nmy\nbandwidth\". It signifies a return to and re-centering of the self, the\nI, me, mine\n, instead of\nus, we, ours\n. There's power in choosing to walk away from, instead of being walked away from.\nActively deciding to walk away from or quit a situation that is taking much more out of you than it ever gives back is powerful, and when it's a woman who does it, it's also seen as subversive. That is misogyny and patriarchy.', a user said: 'I can see that too. I'm now thinking that it's probably super American of me to think anything implying quitting has a negative connotation to it. ðŸ˜­'"
