Not lie, usually this job I have 5hrs of meetigs/day.\nI have overlaping meetings every single day', a user said: 'This makes your original comment pretty pointless.

Do it at night or whenever you want. Not with meetings.'",
        "In response to 'I just listening 10% of The meetings. Half of it is 100% muted, I don't need to be there. I just has to be cause they want it.\nSometimes I put on speakers and ask my wife to tell me when they call my name ( almost never). Mewhile I do code from j2 and j3', a user said: 'Well then, nevermind. Sounds great  cheer mate, stack that bread.\nSend me a job req pls'"
