        "In response to 'I think the record for this is over five years.\nSomeone else did it for 3+, got noticed, fired, and claimed unfair dismissal. Won. Public sector worker in France, though.', a user said: 'There was a secretary at a nearby university to me that came back from FMLA and all her duties had been reassigned and they never shifted them back to her. She came on time every day, worked on her side hustle at work, and sometimes volunteered to help out whenever anyone complained they were swamped, so everyone thought she was a great coworker. When she retired, they went to replace her and in trying to write up the new job posting realized that she didnâ€™t have any duties. For years. Between having a baby and retiring. She is my role model.'"
