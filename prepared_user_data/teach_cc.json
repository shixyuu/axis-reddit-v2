        "In response to 'My school wants me to implement “centers” in my classroom—I asked when I’d have time to prep materials each week and they told me to do it over fall break. When I told them I have other plans, they seemed thoroughly confused.', a user said: 'Good for you. I use centers. Occasionally. Maybe once a unit. When it makes sense to me. It’s a ton of front end work and then very little opportunity to like multitask or grade that day. Which is fine. Because I made the decision it made sense for that day.\nCenters every day or every week cause someone TELLS me to? F that mess.'"
