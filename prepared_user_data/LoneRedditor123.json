Manager's are \"uneasy\" because they don't know who's genuinely working and who's just biding their time before they quit? Good. Be scared.\nUntil ya'll get your shit together and start matching our wages with the cost of living or inflation, this is what you're gonna keep getting. No one is loyal to your company. They're loyal to the family at home that needs food on their table.'"
