        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'Why have you convinced yourself that you can’t get a grant in the next 12 months?'",
        "In response to 'I know I can, I just don’t want to anymore. I’d have to “pivot” away from everything that brought me into this career in the first place.', a user said: 'I get why you feel that way now, but what about science inspired you to go into a career with such a low % chance of getting to where you are now? And then inspired you to put in the insane amount of effort required to be a full prof?'",
        "In response to 'I happen to be squarely focused in one of the now “banned” areas of science. So I can no longer get federal funding for the science that once inspired me.', a user said: 'I guess it depends how specific your research focus is. My understanding is that public health research will still be funded-just not research targeted at specific races/genders. I think somebody with your expertise can navigate the grant system and still do good for people who need this research to be done. So a pivot in wording but not necessarily a pivot in impact.\nGiving up is what they want you to do.'"
