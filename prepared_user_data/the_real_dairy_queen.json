I mean, if doing the duties I was hired for as an employee is \"quiet quitting,\" then I providing, say, the internet service I contacted for has to be \"quiet breach of contract,\" right?', a user said: 'My employer pays me only the exact salary amount in my contract and gives me literally NO more time off than then in my contract as well. Are they quiet firing me? They should be going above and beyond if they want to keep me!'"
