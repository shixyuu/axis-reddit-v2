        "In response to 'was crying the other day about they don’t enjoy being around witnesses anymore\nInteresting comment and thanks for sharing that. Me and the PIMI spouse have talked about this for a really long time now. Basically, that many of the JW relationships we have are very shallow and the people that we can choose as friends in JW Land have so many problems that is difficult to really be friends with anyone.\nJWs are either taking depression medication, alcoholics, mentally unstable or in many cases trying to survive while basically living in poverty. How are you going to develop close friendships if the people you are picking from have an endless number of problems.', a user said: 'I agree about them being shallow. You can never have an honest, open, and deep conversation with any \"close\" JW friend for fear of saying something that they'll feel obligated to report to the elders. I contrast that with my former Navy shipmates who I can talk to about anything and know it stays between us and who'll offer sincere advice and help.'"
