        "In response to 'We don't see the lack of workers in middle management and up. It's all entry level management and below.\nThe retirement wave pulled everyone up a couple rungs in the hierarchy. Coupled with the closed borders for a long time, the ensuing lack of labor drove the price of those jobs up where it could. Construction workers and kitchen staff saw huge increases in wages. Custodians, not so much (people just decided to put up with dirtier offices, or didn't need as much custodial with people not returning to work).\nBut then we had this hybrid situation thing, and I'll be 100% honest- people working from home are not nearly as productive as people in the office. It's not even close.\nAnd everybody wants to do it. Probably because you don't have to work that hard.', a user said: 'and I'll be 100% honest- people working from home are not nearly as productive as people in the office. It's not even close.\nI only have my own org, but our metrics went up 30% per worker after March 2020. It completely made up management's mind on the issue. So you're right, it's not even close.'"
