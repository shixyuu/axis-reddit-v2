        "In response to 'I've seen social media posts by employers claiming that a living wage is \"not how they think\". That an employee's ability to pay rent has nothing to do with the job.\nIMO that's a punchable face.', a user said: 'Yeah dude this guy I was working with used to be in charge of big projects and was trying to convince me that if he hires someone to do a job, it's not his responsibility to pay them a wage where they can live under a roof. Said it wasn't his problem and he pays people what he thinks they're worth.\nIf you are offering a full time job that is not deserving of a living wage, you should not be offering that job at all.'"
