        "In response to 'Yeah, husbands think that when their wives stop nagging, asking, prodding, begging, fighting, trying to work on the relationship, etc., that the wives just like decided to be happy and get over whatever was wrong.  Really, it's that the wife is just . . . done.', a user said: 'THIS! not married but for my most recent relationship. he acted as if i just got over our differences when i haven't. i've even told him i was tired of conversations that never had resolutions. everything just has to be dropped until he is not as mad/bothered anymore.\nit also felt as if i am responsible for how our relationship performs based on my outward behavior and emotions.\ni might be upset if we had a discussion that had no resolution. he will be moody until he is \"over\" the argument or discussion but nothing is resolved between us. If I show I am still bothered then his attitude is thrown off and starts to be passive aggressive and petty towards me. If i just shove my feelings deep down and behave like a happy person? then he is happy and is a generally pleasant person to be around.'"
