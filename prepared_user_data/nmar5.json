That's awesome!', a user said: 'I know someone who works for CapOne and it’s very much been since they brought in former Amazon execs. It went from the best company they ever worked for to this nonsense left and right. A year ago in an all hands meeting they swore up and down to employees that they would never force them to return to office, remote was here to stay. Cue Amazon execs coming in and now they must return to hybrid and live within 50 miles of the office by Jan 1st or they lose they are up for the chopping block. Even employees hired mid-pandemic that were hired as remote from what I’ve heard.'"
