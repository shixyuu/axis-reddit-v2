        "In response to 'I didn’t quiet quit.  After multiple awards without a pay increase that at least met inflation, I decided to only “meet expectations.”\nThen I quit to give myself a promotion.\nEdit: This was at Apple btw.', a user said: 'Right there with you i had done lots over many years and the last 3 years i had no pay increase despite the fact that i was responsible for coding a massive project that was my idea which they patented and i put it in production.  The \"merit\" raise they gave me at that point was lower than inflation and was honestly an insult.  Found a new job within a month that paid substantially more and gtfo out of there.\nThis wasn't apple but another large corp.\nKnow your worth'"
