        "In response to 'Original Post: I think my remote team mate is quiet quitting And it's ticking me off. Need advice if I should say something?\nMy team is fully remote,  spread  across the US. Our individual and team metrics are tracked by the amount of tickets we process on a weekly basis. This is a FULL time job and I've found that a member of our team is only logging about 4 hours a day - if that! Meanwhile, the rest of the team is putting in 9 hr days just to keep up with the volume.  We've also had to log in and work the last two Saturdays just to clear the backlog.  If this person would just work a normal day,  it would lighten the load on each of us. Our manager hasn't seemed to notice that this  person's \"numbers\" are half of what the other team members are producing. Do I speak up or keep my trap shut,  silently seething all day?\n**Thank you everyone for your input! I'm not going to do my managers job for them,  if they don't care,  I won't care either.  I'll hit my targets and focus on my career advancement in 2025.', a user said: 'Are you being asked to do all this extra work? If not, I would consider pulling back to 8 hour workdays. You don't owe anyone the extra work. The more you and others continue to keep overworking to keep up with a high volume of work, the worse things will get. Managers can not open a new position if there's not a business reason to do so. When the work continues to get done, even if that means overworking people, it will not result in change because things are getting done.\nBusiness is largely about status quo. If things are working and getting done changes will not be made. If things fall apart changes will be made. Do with that what you will.'",
