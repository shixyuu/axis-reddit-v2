Well naturally I started to \"fall behind\" as my boss's told me.\nAnyways one day they asked me into their office and sat me down then told me that im terminated from this company due to me not being able to pick up the slack.\nLast I have heard they have gone through at least a dozen other pro loaders because everyone keeps quitting that position.\nMy friends who I worked with there said that the place basically went to shit when I \"left\" because I was actually really good at my jobðŸ¤£\nBasically what im saying is no, they will fire you on the spot for any reason they can.', a user said: 'Most states are \"at will \" workers. Companies Fire for any reason.'",
