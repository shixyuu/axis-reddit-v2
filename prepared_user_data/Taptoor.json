        "In response to 'Short sighted idiot leadership at its finest. There is no doubt that SPEs got mega-shafted. Good luck getting any Examiners to become a sup when we all see how you've treated them', a user said: 'Yep, everything this administration does is short sighted by a mile. The detrimental policies and decisions that they’re pursuing are going to cause problems for years and years. It’s already undermining their goals of getting pendency down and maintaining quality of examination.\nTaking away resources examiners use to search and apply art. The fact that just this necessary Windows 11 upgrade has caused so many system issues on a minor level. The fact that applications and functions that have been developed over the last five years suddenly just don’t seem to want to work anymore.  The fact that we can’t hire.  people are leaving. nobody who is currently on a telework agreement will voluntarily opt to return to campus to become a supervisor. Nobody to train probationary examiners.  We are in for a rough few years.'"
