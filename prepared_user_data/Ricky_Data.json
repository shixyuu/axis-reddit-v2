        "In response to 'We “worked to rule” for 2 days last year due to stalled contract negotiations. Our district retaliated by ignoring teacher appreciation week (not even allowing our PTO to appreciate us—individual parents paid out of their own pocket to bring us breakfast one day).\nAnyway, this field sucks.', a user said: 'That’s ridiculous. I’m sorry that you got retaliated against. hope non-teachers are lurking here and seeing these posts.'",
        "In response to 'The term is ‘work to rule’. I encourage it.', a user said: 'Right. I put this in another thread. There’s nothing wrong with “work to rule”.'",
        "In response to 'yeah -- work to rule. \"quiet quitting\" is a capitalist term, but you're right.\n(capitalist in its negative connotation that doing only what you are paid to do is a bad thing)\neducation is being propped up by teachers who do too much after hours, making it look like the rest of us are simply dropping the ball. I get the reason, but I'm here to say that you can be a super effective teacher even if you work to rule simply by cutting back on the nonsense. the first things to get cut when we have to reprioritize simply being present and prepared for the students are the things we probably shouldn't have to do in the first place.', a user said: 'This is an important point. There’s a lot of volunteer labor that supports the education system because no one will tell you about the 80/20 rule and the importance of focusing on one priority. And keeping strong when others push back.'"
