        "In response to '\"We've hit all our strategic goals for this past year\"\nThat's how I would spin it. Then, if she talks about the drop in extras, talk about how your priorities were focused on the strategic goals and that you prioritized those over the less essential tasks.\nIf she says they're important too, then feign ignorance in saying that you didn't realize she wanted them as they were part of the strategic goals the team had set at the beginning of the year, and that you didn't know she wanted you to focus on them.\nEssentially, you never let the blame move to you. She is your boss. If she wanted those things to be prioritized, she should have vocalized it sooner than your annual review.\nAlso, I'll caution that if you're hoping she retires and you're expecting any chance of slipping into her role, quiet quitting might be a mistake. I'm not advocating for doing unpaid work, or going above and beyond what you're paid for. But, if you're just doing the bare minimum, it's unlikely they try to promote you.', a user said: 'Excellent advice!\nBecause the OP mentions \"good idea fairy moments\", If the boss pulls bullshit like \"That's not true, definitely said we/you should\nxyz\n\", ask for the paper trail.\n\"Oh, could you show me the email/correspondence where you incorporated that into our strategic goals? Because since we hit all our other goals, I'm sure that if it was incorporated into the strategic plan fully, it would have also been completed.\"\nBecause it sounds like there's a lot of talk and no structure'"
