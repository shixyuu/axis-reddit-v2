        "In response to 'Original Post: SPE quiet quitting I never thought quiet quitting could be so detrimental to an organization.\nMy spe went from being a superstar spe in the workgroup to nobody home. He was involved in a ton of projects and was well respected by probationary examiners.\nHis out of office teams status message used to be a mile long with many alternative POCs for his projects ... now its like \"off till monday, no phone/email access, contact any workgroup spe\".\nJunior examiner actions get zero feedback and are quickly signed.\nYet morale is high and smiles all around, right?', a user said: 'I am in a junior- heavy art unit and my SPE is a nice person, highly contentious. Under the old way of doing things, he ran an efficient AU and trained examiners who wrote quality office actions. He could have been good for 20+ years more of training new examiners in this art area.\nNow, he exhibits no sign of decreased review. I am concerned that he is going to burn himself out ... For what? So USPTO can \"save money\" and Elon won't have to pay taxes.'"
