[External Link]: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-quiet-quitting-work-ethic-millennials-money-struggles-2023-10', a user said: 'Yo for real.....I'm a miserable millennial who gave up dreams and aspirations for a what I thought would be a stable existence if I just did everything right (get educated, pay taxes, even joined the fucking military, get educated again [master's], and keep my nose clean).....I went corporate, thought I had a decent career, and what was it all for?   FUCKING NOTHING!  I got 2 degrees, 15 years of experience and I've been laid off 3 fucking times in less than 10 years. Never for performance reasons, always \"reductions in force\" or \"M&A\"......it's all been a giant fucking lie. I dunno whether to have my mid-life crisis, if I can even afford it because it usually requires blowing up all stability in your life, or just waiting til the day my retirement comes in the form of a handgun, the biggest joint I'll ever smoke, and a bottle of the finest whiskey I can buy in my moment of \"I'm fucking done with this shit.\"\nGood on GenZ....give em hell.'"
