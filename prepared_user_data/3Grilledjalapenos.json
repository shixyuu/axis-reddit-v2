[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'I recently left a finance dept at a Fortune 100. Depending on the meeting size, we would sometimes admit that we didn’t have enough people to do the job, and other times we would claim we “just need to pull together”.  The C-suite had believe cutting headcount would save money, which is accurate.  They did and then less work got done accurately and on time.\nThis sort of thing has been popular to implement in business school case analysis for years, but in the real world often shows a misunderstanding of the needs of a business.  Without the downtime, and when constantly pushing ever harder, employees will leave and take process knowledge with them. Sometimes this can be replicated, but not as often as executives believe. At my last company an analyst built a program pulling data from 3 ERP systems, that used two Python scripts to populate it into Excel, and then a rotating series of excel macros to grab the correct period data. No one knew what he did to build or maintain it, but they knew it took him 20 minutes each Monday morning, so when he quit they hired a new analyst to do what they assumed was 20 minutes of work. No one left in the dept understood Python, but it was assumed to not be a big deal. Then analyst burn out and she quit in a few months.'"
