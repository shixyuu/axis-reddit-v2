        "In response to 'Lol I already go radio silent after 5PM by shutting off my work laptop and not having my work email connected to any other devices. That's just called setting boundaries.', a user said: 'EXACTLY!!! I literally lock my laptop in a safe every night.. for security reasons.  Nobody from work has my cell phone number, and I refuse to use any non work hosted chat or email program.  If they want me on call,  they agree to it up front: min 1 hour billable time,  anything over that is rounded up to the hour,  and I get time and a half when it happens. If they want me,  they have to compensate me.'"
