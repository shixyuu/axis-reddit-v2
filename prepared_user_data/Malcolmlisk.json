        "In response to 'Original Post: What leaders need to know about quiet quittingâ€¦ aka the labor rebellion [External Link]: https://v.redd.it/xravs6qh8ot91', a user said: 'Saying that this labor 'rebelion' is completely different from the rest is not accurate at all. All 'labor rebelions' revolve around the same topic, which are working dynamics and quality of life. In Marx words, the salary for the worker will tend to be the minimum possible, just to survive and have a minimal descendency so the 'worker race' does not go extint. And when this gets extreme, the posibility of a revolution appears in the horizon.\nAlso, saying that this is the most diverse 'labor rebelion' is also not accurate at all... In this case, is afecting the USA a lot, but not completely. The working activist from the start of the SXX where more diverse and from everywhere. From Russia to Africa, with china, vietnam, middle east countries, mediterranean countries (like the valkans and rumania...), England, Europe, South America... Hell, even in the USA there were some activist that were very active and from different races and ethnics. Right now, this is not true, also the people who are quitting are not educated in working dynamics or economical phylosophy... In Spain, at the start of the SXX the most readed book was 'The Conquest of Bread' by Kropotkin. Right now nobody knows that book.'"
