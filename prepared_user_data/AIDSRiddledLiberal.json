        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is almost certainly a corporate entity spawned buzzword created to provide counter pressure to the growing workers rights movement in the United States. The catchiness of it and the way it just popped into the zeitgeist out of nowhere are clear indicators of corporate slime I’d say. It’s sound strategy for (insert corp giant) to whip up the entire ownership class and create solidarity among the elites, rather than fighting this thing one Starbucks at a time.'"
