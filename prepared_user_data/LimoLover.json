        "In response to 'I chose to fade, I'm not playing by their idiotic rules anymore so why should I write a letter to them or even call. They certainly forgot all about me with the quickness once I became disabled and had to use the phone hook- up pre pandemic. That made fading extremely easy and I no longer have anyone still in the cult, so it turned out to be lucky.', a user said: 'That's exactly what happened with me, after a bad car accident I was dealing with chronic pain and started just listening on the phone, my husband\nnever\nhad his heart into being a JW (he pretty much got baptized bc he wanted to marry me lol) it was so much easier to disappear when we had already been physically missing from meetings and just like you I quickly learned that all my \"friends\" people I'd known my entire life and even my own family who all knew what I was dealing with couldn't any of them bother to be there for me:-/ in fact many of them used my medical issues against me saying things like I was a drug addict for taking prescription painkillers etc! I'm so much better off without them! Sorry to hear you had health troubles and were failed by the \"loving\" borg too tho :-/ (Edit spelling)'"
