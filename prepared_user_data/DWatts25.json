After the fall of the Whigs political party the US became a capitalist country resulting in the increase in greed and inhumane practices.'",
        "In response to 'Depending on how long you are employed the notice time is between 6 weeks (when employed less than 2 years) to 5 months (after 25 years of employment). Most commonly it will be 3 months (6-15 years of employment). All of this fully paid of course.
