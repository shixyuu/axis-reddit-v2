        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'Your peers are largely to blame if you feel your workload is too much.\nYour store manager and store leads want 150% work completed every single day. Your coaches and team leads must have that expectation, and therefore it falls upon associates to work towards that goal every night.\nIn all reality if you dont work at a $120M+ store you dont have the freight for any single associate to not be done with a task on time. When you have too many lazy associates the more exceptional associates are tasked with more to do to get the job done.\nIn your average $100M store everyone should be done with their most significant tasks early and move on to do something to fill the rest of the shift. Effective busy work. You only see management applying the finishing touches for the next shift. That's how it works in an ideal Walmart world.\nWhat you probably get is 8 - 30 associates on a given team with only 1 - 4 actual working associates and the rest are doing the bare minimum or less just to grind the clock out.'"
