        "In response to 'Yes! Any time\nquiet quitting\nis brought up I always correct this to\nActing your Wage\nEmployees are finally starting to wake up to the fact that going above and beyond no longer will get you a raise or promotion instead work is rewarded with more work and good work is rewarded with a job title change with more responsibilities at the same pay rate you were at before.', a user said: 'This happened to me 5 years ago. They \"promoted\" me to team lead. Gave me a bunch of responsibilities. When I asked if I am getting any raise, they said it's being discussed. After 3 months, I was burnt out. Still no raise. I quit after a couple more weeks. Never exerted more than 60% of my effort at work ever since.'"
