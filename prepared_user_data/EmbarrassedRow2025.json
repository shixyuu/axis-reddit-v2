        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Me male HL wife LL Have you reached that stage ? Quiet quitting not leaving because of kids or what not but just quitting on the idea of romance in your head letting go of the resentment for your own mental health  and accepting that she’s just a roommate now ? We had yet another talk yesterday about it which she acknowledged the situation made promises again and that night it was just heavy snoring, told her today that I’m disappointed that our discussion led to no improvement even after her promises she said but we both agreed to make efforts ( because yeah I turned LL4U after all this time) I told her it’s ok I don’t even want to talk about it, I’m not even pissed as usual , she’s snoring as I’m typing this next to me and i don’t even care i don’t want her anymore and the sad part is the idea of getting to this point used to scare me but now I just don’t care, I don’t even think I love her anymore just that I’m used to her.', a user said: 'Yep, reached it a long long time ago.  She claims that she has since tried to \"save\" the relationship...  but, as I point out I've tried everything I knew, and was rejected for it, not simple failure, shot down in flames.\nSo, until she picks up the relationship she tore down and does the work to rebuild it, and tells me the what and how to participate (after all, I obviously fail at this)\nWell, I just dont know what to do, so I'll do the minimum.  Even sex these days is just a passing mention like the weather.  Sometimes it actually happens, mostly not, because romance is dead, pleading is repulsive, asking is denied...'",
        "In response to 'Those last lines summed up it, sad still. Is she actually trying or she’s fine with the status quo', a user said: 'According to her she hates the status quo, she's finally realized no matter how hard she doesn't talk or insists she's fine, that dont fix anything...\nas for trying... yeah, well... \nTLDR: past has consequences even if you refuse to recognize them.\nI once ran across a definition of frustration as the space between your expectations and your perceived reality.  I long ago gave up expectations of her when it comes to me.  I don't expect her to be sexually available to me, I don't expect any form of intimacy from her...\nSo when she asks me what I want/expect from her, I answer honestly: NOTHING.  She doesn't seem to know where to go from there.  I gave up, this is the shit show it is, I'm not fine with it but, I promised her to give up, she's freed of expectations that she found so unwanted, what more can I do for her, I killed love, killed intimacy, pretty much everything that differs an intimate relationship from that of a familial/relative/acquaintance.\nShe thought that it didn't come with a cost.  When I try to tell her about what it costs, the mountain of built up issues...  but, it's fine, these are my problems and have nothing to do with her, and I have no expectations of her concerning them, just letting you know however that they make this fantasy relationship of \"putting the past behind us\" impossible.'"
