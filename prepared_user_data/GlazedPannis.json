        "In response to 'I did similar. Huge (nonsexual) harassment situation, HR ignored it and my boss decided to target me for speaking up for myself to HR.\nAfter 3 weeks of HR trying to set up a meeting and canceling it followed by regular, nasty threats from my boss I'd had enough. Squared away the work I had that day that needed follow up with some other coworkers, made sure my documentation was in order for everything I was responsible for and updated in our shared drives, left my computer in my desk drawer with my keys and hit send on my resignation letter when I got to my car.\nI felt like shit, I'd never done anything like that before and felt like I had just committed career suicide. I applied for EI (employment insurance) on the hope the excess harassment might qualify me. After talking to the adjudicator with EI, telling her everything, and hearing her reactions I realized they had messed me up pretty badly and I *did* make the right choice. 24 hours later my claim was approved and I realized maybe it wasn't me that was the problem.', a user said: 'There are always exceptions to EI especially when you’ve either got proof of what was going on, or if the company is blacklisted. My brother worked for Rogers years ago and the stress ended up being too much so he up and quit. Didn’t think he’d get EI, but applied anyway. Got a call and they explained that this company was blacklisted, so anyone who quits or gets fired from there are exempt from that rule.\nSeriously, how poorly run does your company have to be where quitting isn’t going to get you penalized when it comes to EI? Lol'"
