        "In response to 'I'm curious: Shouldn't the republicans media platforms be shitting it over that settlement, heck even republican politicians should be worried with the amount of defamation and shit they spew I'm shocked they haven't been taken to court yet.\nEdit: Also, what is going on in America? Have you stopped education or something because fuck me you got some people lacking it with the drones shit.', a user said: 'For what it's worth, I think that the drones thing is not as big as we think (a bunch of people and high profile officials talking about a relatively low number of stories, so it feels like more than it is). It's still a weird sort of media craze, but I don't think think it's mass hysteria (yet).\nOverall, though, yes the US has a massive problem with media literacy and anti-intellectualism and no critical thinking, and i think we're going to have a lot more of this kind of thing for quite some time.'"
