        "In response to 'What really frustrated me with my most recent job.\nContract negotiations with a 3rd party for a service, they wanted to include annual cost increases for  inflation/CoL with a clause for early renegotiation if it fluctuates by too much.\nCEO and others in the business were fine with that, it seems to be the norm now as the next contract up for review has a similar clause added.\nLast few years there have been 0 pay raises at the company I was working for, I asked an employee at the 3rd party and they had the same thing.\nIt's truly fucked up when businesses are happy to pay each other more based on inflation but as soon as an employee asks for the same it's offensive.', a user said: 'That example exposes the key economic problem with labor/employer relations without a union, the imbalance of power.\nThe CEO would love to pay the the service less, but if they don't, the service might walk.  He could put his feet down, and maybe avoid the raise for a year, but he'd be ruining his relationship with the 3rd party and getting worse service from them.  The 3rd party probably has 100s of other customers and is going to prioritize those who pay fully.  In other words, the 3rd party has negotiating leverage.\nAs an employee, your only leverage is to walk.  But, you rely on your employer for 100% of your income, in addition to health insurance, retirement savings, etc.  Employers know that which is why existing employees don't get pay raises.  sure, 1/10 might walk and they have to hire a new person, but any cost from that is more than offset by lower salaries on the 9/10.'"
