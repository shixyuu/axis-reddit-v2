        "In response to '25% cut 8 days into the job is wild. Capital One is behaving like this!?  This surprises the shit outta me.', a user said: 'i had a friend who was working on their enterprise level QA team. Apparently the business line could NOT for the life of themselves come up with meaningful goals for the company across the board. Of the goals they did lay down, they could NOT plot progress at achieving goals. Like they could have easily gone the Apple route and just consolidation verticals or some other bean counter efficiencies. What occurred instead was Elon Musk level rich and detached  (but without the antisemitism) projects (e.g. banking coffee shops where bankers would saunter up to clients as they drank lattes, like if finance was a bad Friends episode).\nLong story short, my friend was laid off after senior leadership got the first 12 month trailing progress report without much rebuttal for reforms.'"
