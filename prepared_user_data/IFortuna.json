        "In response to 'Original Post: I have Stage 4 Cancer and my wife quietly quit our marriage. AMA What the title says and add in the current climate in the US, so to move out and get a divorce would leave us both fucked.\nEdit: Wanted to tell everyone thank you for your kindness', a user said: 'My late partner had stage 4 colon cancer. (Not the reason he passed many years later). He had radiation and chemo.  I fixed smoothies for him everyday consisting of Brewer's Yeast, all kinds of vitamins, seaweed powder (to combat radiation), yogurt, kale, fresh berries like blue berries, ice, a small amount of sweetener and more.  He over came the cancer and the doctor said he gained 30 pounds which none of his patients ever had.  I suggest you concentrate on getting well and forgetting and breaking ties with those who are bringing you down with their bad energy.  Stay positive and work to recover.  I wish you all the best, I'm rooting for you and your recovery.'"
