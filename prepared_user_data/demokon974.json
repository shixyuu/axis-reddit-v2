        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is a bs moniker made up by the capitalistic bootlickers. Doing your job within the scope of your job duties and not going beyond that is in no way an act of quitting. The capitalists are just so used to being in a power imbalance with the workforce that they now expect everyone to devote all of their life energy to the betterment of their shareholders profits. Sounds like the capitalists have a major case of entitlement disease. Whomever still uses this terminology is perpetuating a myth.', a user said: 'It used to be that bonuses or promotions were the motivation for people to go the extra mile. But increasingly, in the US at least, these no longer seem to be worth it. Bonuses and promotions go to the people who belong to the right group, belong to the right frat, went to the right schools, go to the right church, etc.. Actually being good at your job has become an after thought.'"
