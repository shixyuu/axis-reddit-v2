        "In response to 'Get rid of fucking social media first. This is all born from envy and an excessive use of a platform built for flaunting, you're the only one who allows yourself to compete against others. Without social media, you don't even know what to compete against in the first place. Stop being so interested in other people. Focus on a core group of close friends and family, you'll realise other people don't matter in the least whether they just got married, bought a yacht, or are dead.\nDon't you guys feel like jealousy is an ugly emotion? It makes you feel really bad and makes you really weak.', a user said: 'but the funny cat pictures though'"
