        "In response to 'I worked at a college bookstore for a few years, making minimum wage. One of our textbook leads left and the manager called me into his office, saying he'd like me to take over some of his responsibilities. I asked if it came with a new title and pay raise and he said no, so I politely declined. He was shocked and kept pushing but I told him that I wasn't doing the work of a textbook lead while making the same amount of money as someone who started working a week ago.', a user said: 'Where I work we very rarely have managers working on weekends, and as such when we get very busy or have emergencies happen (not an irregular occurrence) things go to shit because there is no manager available.\nI raised this issue with one of our senior management who had a think about it and came back to me, very pleased with himself, and said perhaps I, and another longstanding member of the team, might act as senior lead on weekends? I asked did this come with any payrise? Any perks? Anything official? And was told no but its good experience!\nHe was shocked when I declined flat out.'"
