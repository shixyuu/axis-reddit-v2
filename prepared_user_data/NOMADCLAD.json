Management are going to be rapidly replaced with AI when owners and board members start realising what a massive waste of money they are compared.'",
        "In response to 'What's frustrating is GOOD management is invaluable to the people under them. Good management should be firmly on the side of workers, keeping out bad exec decisions, passing up what's actually needed to get the job done. But they're not employed by workers, so pandering to the higher ups is more likely to keep you employed but less effective at the job they need to do.\nAI is good at some things but absolutely not at being a GOOD manager, interacting with workers and understanding the workflow. But it's cheap and can do the work of a bad manager, just balancing books and firing lowest numbers.\nAI managers will only damage actual workers.', a user said: 'Oh I agree. It will suck for everyone because it will only cause the working class to lose the few good apple managers that are left.'"
