        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'Now that we're in the late stage of capitalism and there are no more unexploited markets or resource pools, the overall rate of profit begins to terminally decline, and the only way to combat this trend is to intensify the existing exploitation.\nAnd how are you going to squeeze more out of workers who have already been earning a stagnant wage for decades? By redefining work as something that requires total, never-ending dedication, and expects no compensation beyond what our deified \"job-creators\" are willing to offer.'"
