        "In response to 'I did this shit long before this was a thing. Over a decade ago. I'd just ignore texts and emails from my manager when I was off my shift.\nOne day, freezing temps caused a water main to rupture in the non-heated foyer of the restaurant. I wasn't scheduled to work that day, and my boss texted me to demand that I come into work to help them clean up the mess (four inches of water throughout the entire restaurant). I told her I'm not coming in on my day off and good luck with that.\nPeople from corporate had to come in to help with the dirty work of cleaning that shit up, along with my manager and co-workers. I ended up getting written up for disobedience and refusing to be a team worker.\nI scoffed and contacted an employment lawyer, had him write a letter threatening that if they didn't remove the write-up from my personnel file, there would be legal action taken.\nCorporate forced the manager to rip the write up sheet in front of me. She was red in the face while doing it. She told all of my coworkers about my \"insubordination\" and how I \"threw everyone under the bus that day\". They all hated me and I had to transfer to another restaurant because of the toxicity and hostility towards me.\nI quit a couple years later in 2015, because they underpaid and overworked me. No appreciation.\nFuck you, Kim.', a user said: 'Being \"written up\" is BS. Who cares? The only people who will see it are your employer and they already know, so who cares? Such an empty threat'"
