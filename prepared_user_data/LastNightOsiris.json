        "In response to 'No, they don’t have a point.\nI\nknow\nthat some VP or Product person is going to scrap 85% of what I work on in a given quarter. They’re going to say “we’re pivoting to meet new customer needs” or “this project has to be flexible to adapt to changes in technology” or some other bullshit.\nI still do my job. I can’t tell my manager “I’m not going to work on X because VP Asshat is going to change his mind in 4 months anyway”. I just do my job, and collect my paycheck.\nI understand that police put their own health and safety in jeopardy, but that’s what they signed up for. Their role in the executive branch of government is fair and equal enforcement of the law.\nIf they want to collect high 6 figures and do fuck all then they should apply for a director role at my company.', a user said: 'I'm not an apologist for nor supporter of the police, but I think you are mischaracterizing their position. To use your analogy, it would be more like there are 12 different VPs and product people each asking for different things, and your group only has enough people to deliver 6 of them. There are various strategies you could use in this situation - do just enough on each one to stop anyone from getting too mad; prioritize the ones that are most likely to make it to the final product; prioritize the ones where the person asking has done you favors in the past; etc. You could even figure out ways to work better and more efficiently, and maybe get 8 of them done.\nI don't know for sure exactly how resource constrained the SFPD is. They aren't very forthcoming with the information that would answer that question, and I don't trust them to self report accurately. But their claim has pretty consistently been that they don't have enough manpower and are subject to too many restrictive and time consuming procedural rules to address all of the law enforcement needs of the city.'"
