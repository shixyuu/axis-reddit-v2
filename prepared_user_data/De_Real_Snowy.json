        "In response to 'Something I've always said is you can pay your babysitter to care for your child but you can't pay them to love the kid. When a workplace expects you to be \"passionate about the product\", or to \"care about the community\", or to be \"excited about changing the world\" what they really mean is they want you to work harder than what you're getting paid to do, work extra hours, work weekends, etc. For those first starting out in any tech or media job, if they say all these things and then try to balance it with free lunches and a foosball table WALK AWAY.', a user said: 'One of my former employer said: \"you got to put the effort like you own the company.\" I was a Jr. Position (in finance)with reparative work, that I did deadline to deadline. Her expectations was that I will be ahead of the deadline. With $17/h she wasn't getting that out of me.\nUntil I stayed till 3 am for 3 days (starting work at 7-8am daily) during Xmas, after she told me that again and was frustrated (note: I never missed a deadline). The worse decision I've done, so I  quite few months after as I stopped  going above and beyond for them and they became more toxic. They told me I would get promoted and a raise for my time staying it during whole December, non of that happened, so I quit. 6 months of hell, although I learned quite a bit and developed some skill thanks to them.\nEdit:\nWe don't own the company, and we definitely don't get paid as the owner of a multi million international company (that I was with). The worse thing they can say, intercompany propaganda.'"
