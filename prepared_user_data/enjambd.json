        "In response to 'Original Post: Minnesota among top 5 states for quiet quittingâ€™ [External Link]: https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-quiet-quitting-jobs-2022', a user said: 'I was confused and thought \"quiet quitting\" meant literally doing a work slowdown or just slacking off until you got fired. I didn't realize it just meant doing your job normally?\nAlso this study seems like a bunch of gobbledygook. They just analyzed some tweets and where they came from. It's not an actual survey of workers in different states. \"Quiet quitting\" is a trending term right now. This is all so dumb.'"
