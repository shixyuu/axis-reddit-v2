        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'See this almost happened at a previous job, I was admin, but they wanted me to do admin and sales for no extra money. Then the manager told me if I didn't he would sack me. As I had just come back from maternity leave, I panicked and started doing it all, realised I couldn't, quickly found a new job and left. When I left, I found out they'd replaced me with 2 different people because they'd realised it was too much for 1 person to do. Company has gone bankrupt now, but I wish I'd known back then that I could have argued it, but I was so exhausted and scared I'd lose my job that I just got on with it. Regret it so much now, loved the admin part, was great fun! (And the redundancy payout 2 years later would have been handy!!)'",

Know better now!\nHe hated giving anyone extra money. I remember the accountant telling him he had no choice but to pay us extra when the government raised the minimum wage. Awful man, God knows why any of us worked for him for so long.'"
