Now obviously would I review it? Sure, but so long as their is no obvious deficiency or lack of productivity why tf would I care?\nI deal with this from my higher ups as well, I think both of then would be considered Gen X and yeah whole lots of \"collaboration\" talk being beneficial in person and it's like \"bulllllllllshit. Collaborate just fine remotely. It's bullshit.\"\nSo it isn't just Gen Z that rejects this archaic crap.'"
