        "In response to 'As an employer I feel that it is important to note that we discard the resumes of applicants who only stay at a job for 3-4months. No longevity on a resume doesn’t signify burnout to me. It signifies someone who cannot carry a job.', a user said: 'My boss shot me when I pointed this out on a resume he was excited about.\n“He’s got all these big names and strong titles on his resume!”\n“Yeah, and he’s been in six different positions over the past 2 years.”\nThat’s the day I learned to not be honest.  I figured this company was different because equity is a large part of the comp plan - and I didn’t want some disloyal easy-rider to get in the way of my equity.\nSure enough, offer was made and then we didn’t hear a peep.   Suddenly his LinkedIn profile showed he suckered some other company.   Good luck to them!'"
