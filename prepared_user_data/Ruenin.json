        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'In America, we are guilted into thinking that if we're not putting in 110%, then we aren't worthy of the job, even though we don't reap the benefits as the executives do. All the technology that comes out that is supposed to make things easier really only just makes it so we can do more work. Employee salaries has not increased at the pace of GDP, which has increased exponentially in the last 40 years. We are arguably the hardest working country on the planet but only a fraction of the people here actually see any benefit to all that work. Add onto that  the idea that success in America is largely measured by your bank account and what you own, and you can see how we are driven to keep going long after we're burned out.'"
