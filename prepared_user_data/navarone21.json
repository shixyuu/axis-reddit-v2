I have not had a raise in 3 years. With my company touting record profits, I just assume they want less from me. I used to work whenever I was needed. 24/7. Now I work 8-5. I Fully take my lunch daily and I walk away at 5 on the dot. Also, most down time is used training myself in things that I need to shore up.\nAlso, every ticket is on a 24hr cooldown at least. Unless we are actual pals, I just work my queue.\nThe whole Quiet Quitting thing is part of the corporate push of \"No one wants to work anymore\" nonsense. People want to work, they just want to get paid for it.'"
