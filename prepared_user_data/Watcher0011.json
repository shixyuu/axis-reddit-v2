        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Amazon There's a movement not really just Amazon but work in general since inflation is going so high, people are just giving up trying extra or doing more hard work than what's necessary. Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'It’s funny people still call it quiet quitting and act like this is some new thing, most of the US workforce does the bare minimum, especially at a job like this, this has been going it for decades lol. Don’t let your job define your life, don’t do work you’re not paid to do, and don’t pretend like you are fighting capitalism lol, it’s just work.'"
