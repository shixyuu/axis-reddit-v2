        "In response to 'Original Post: Bill Maher being very anti WFH and against quiet quitting the past year [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/6nykqc1bx0pa1.png', a user said: 'Well... Yeah? Some people are afraid to go to the office for health reasons. That's a real thing that happens. A lot of people also dont want to go because the concept of an office doesn't make sense anymore given the internet exists. Or they hate their coworkers. Or have a 45-90 min commute each way. Or found that they work better from home.\nFrankly I'm surprised that companies are pushing for people to return the office at all given the expense of running an office. Boomers gonna boom I guess.'"
