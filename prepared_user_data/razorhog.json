        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting could be the best thing for education. Everyone's definition of quiet quitting is different. Mine is not working outside of your contract ours. Work from 7am to 3pm and then you're done. No lesson planning outside of class, no chaperoning, no working gates unless it involves extra pay.\nWhen you ignore these boundaries, you overwork yourself, can't sustain the position, and you end up leaving the profession and in return your students lose a great educator.\nIf you can't do all the tasks a school asks for you to do during the day, that is not the fault of you, it is the fault of your boss requiring too much of you. If you continue doing these tasks outside of your hours you are effectively telling your admin that this is okay.\nWhen you put your value in working extra hours because it makes you feel like you are \"doing it for the kids\" you are doing the opposite long term. The precedent that teachers have to put so much time in outside of work is toxic and leads to teacher burnout. A shortage of teachers is not good for any educational system.\nI'd like to blame admin, government, or students but the easiest fix is in the teachers themselves. When we overwork ourselves, we effectively hurt education. Only work your hours and if you can't get your work done, let your admin know you don't have the time. Healthy work life balance can keep us going and bring more teachers into the profession.\nEdit: Sorry y'all. I didn't realize how problematic the term \"quiet quitting\" is. I am glad though that it brought some attention to the post which led to some good discussion. I will use a different term from here on out and I am happy a lot of you only work your hours or work your contract.', a user said: 'I have been \"working to contract\" for years now. If something doesn't get done then it doesn't get done. Whenever I am asked to do extra during my prep I always tell my admin upfront the opportunity cost for taking away my time:\n\"Oh you want me to plc today? Well, okay then my lesson plans will be late this week, chief. Oh I need to sub a class? Sure thing bossman, but my grades aren't going to be turned in by the deadline.\"\nI won't be winning teacher of the year by doing this but who cares about that. I said enough is enough when my daughter was born several years ago and I was trying to hold her while grade papers. I reclaimed my evenings and weekends for myself and my family and I haven't looked back.\nIf all teachers would do this then it would force\nthem\nto change how the education system is operated.'"
