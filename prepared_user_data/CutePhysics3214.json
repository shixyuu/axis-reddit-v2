        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'There are many good suggestions here already.  Any change of process from the company is an excellent time to slow down.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still learning the new way‚Äù.\nAnd start really driving the priorities with those above. Only work on the high priority jobs. And if you run out of hours in the day with much not done ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the plan'"
