I’ve downshifted to third and still run circles around everyone.\nA business will drop you like a bad habit, if necessary. I know.\nSo I’m enjoying a better work/life balance. Only the employee can make that happen.'",
        "In response to 'What do you do?', a user said: 'Advertising creative that was duped into thinking working nights and weekends, and holidays, made you a hero.\nA true hero is present enough to recognize your SO is depressed. Because you’re not present.'",
        "In response to 'Exactly the same here. Only problem now is dealing with the internal insecurity. My 5x was one of my usps. ”Now I am just 2x most people. Will i be out of a job in 10 years?”  Kind of like that.', a user said: 'Depends what success looks like for you. Once I prioritized happiness above promotions, titles on business cards and new business wins, my life changed.\nAnd the balance made me a better creative. You can’t see the solution if you’re inches away. My brain needs a break. That allows it to reorganize information and patterns. Then a higher and different perspective allows for truly fresh thinking.\nI’ve cracked it. And, most importantly, I don’t struggle with the self-flagellation I’m prone to inflict. “Am I happy?” is a simple way to check in.\nI was outstanding at work. But that cannot be the only thing.'"
