        "In response to 'Original Post: Saw this posted on LinkedIn: “Quiet Quitting” [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/g2rczsex4xh91.jpg', a user said: 'I thought quiet quitting was much more clever. I thought it was 1) have wfh job 2) get new job - presumably another WFH but doesn't matter. 3) start new job without actually quitting old job. 4) Stop doing work for old job, stop attending meetings, etc. 5) draw two paychecks until fired from old job. Absolute ffing brilliance if you ask me.\nAnd employers deserve this. Sometime in the 00s they stopped giving references beyond \"yes that person worked here\". They shot themselves in the foot and deserve all of this.'"
