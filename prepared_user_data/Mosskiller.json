Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shop😂', a user said: 'I’ve only had to return an alcohol order one time. The person didn’t answer door, texts, or calls. Then half an hour later I got a message from her stating she never received her order 🤦‍♂️ I just said contact support as I returned it. She went off. Luckily I completed my next couple orders and DD shut off the communication capability'",
