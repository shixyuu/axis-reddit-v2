        "In response to 'Might be a bit of an unpopular opinion, but...\nIf you are doing it, absolutely fine. More power to you. It shouldn't be looked down upon to just want to come in, do your job, no more, and go home. \nI am currently doing this, myself. In fact I have asked to be taken off of some extra duties that I have been given over the last year.\nHOWEVER...\nIf you actually want to progress within your job and make it a career, don't be surprised if you do \"quiet quit\" and you get overlooked for promotion.\nTaking initiative, helping other people/departments, going above and beyond are all things your employer will tend to look for, just to make their shortlist.', a user said: 'In a logical, fair company - sure.\nAs someone who went above and beyond consistently in a shit job, promotion never came regardless of effort and care on my part. I saved them thousands, pushed the company ridiculously well and got nothing for it, and treated like shit.'",
        "In response to 'This is my situation now. I’ve done 2 interviews for jobs I’m more than capable of and not got the role - one in favour of someone it was very clearly made for from the get go and one because of ‘difficult personalities’ apparently (not my personality but who I’d be working with! This one particularly stung as I was the only fucking candidate and they’d rather risk it with someone external than give it to me - not that I particularly want it anymore given the reason lmao).\nIt’s absolute bullshit and my motivation is at rock bottom. I have gone above and beyond time and time again, and everyone in my team knows I do, but my interview panel was one where 2 out of the 3 panelists don’t work in my team or even my fucking field! How can you describe how you step up to the senior level time and again when 2/3 interviewers don’t have a clue what stepping up even is in your team/field??\nSo now, nope. Not stepping up. Not helping train anyone or doing anything else expected of me outside my job role. I’m coming in at 8, doing my role and leaving at 4. My manager is one of my closest friends and he is outraged I didn’t get these jobs too, but totally gets why I’m totally checking out from now on.\nI’m staying because I’m planning to have a baby within the next year and then once I’m getting back into my career again I’m out. I might not even come back after maternity, my husband earns more than enough that we could pay my maternity pay back (also partly because the maternity offering isn’t great lol). My manager knows this and has basically said ‘I’d be gutted if you left but yep go for it’.\nSo yeah, fuck it. I’ve worked my arse off for 3 years including throughout the pandemic and it’s now clear to me I will only progress when the organisation thinks it’s ok, not when I’m capable or demonstrate I am at interview. I’m done.\nCurrently working from home today and as we speak I’m playing PlayStation cos FUCK IT.', a user said: 'I don’t blame you, a lot of companies take the fucking piss. At that old job I didn’t “quiet quit” I actually quit because I got screamed at for doing something my manager told me to do.\nI installed a suggestion box. That concept was highly offensive to senior management. Apparently people would abuse them through it and I asked what they meant and they said people would ask for sick leave.\nSo yeah, I quit. Getting reamed for doing my job and their attitude to their employees was enough for me to give up on them after everything I did for them.\nGet what you can, leave, don’t look back. Theres some seriously fucked up employers out there. No one quits a bad job, they quit bad managers.'"
