        "In response to 'Unlike the other comments that are busy circlejerk insulting one another: generally your hob can make you work overtime. The union contract specifies that the employer cannot do that and that employees must volunteer to do OT. Presumably if IT is mandated by the employer that it cones at a 3X rate, which they don't want to pay.', a user said: 'I'm assuming they mean \"would you like to take on some OT shifts?\" And not \"we want you to work more shifts\"'",
        "In response to 'You were fired, or layed off? Termination and lay off are very different. You performed the role, completed your duties per your employment contract? Just didn't go \"101%\"? You were layed off, termination is in relation to a violation in most cases. (For example quota violations.)', a user said: 'Termination means it was employer initiated. Layoffs are termination. You're probably looking for \"fired.\" Being fired and being laid off are two different types of termination. Contract expired is a termination.\nVoluntary separation is the opposite of termination, where it is employee-initiated.'"
