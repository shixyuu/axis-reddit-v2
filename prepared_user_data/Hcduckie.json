        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting life I am quiet quitting life and nobody realizes thatâ€™s what it is. My friends think Iâ€™m just being a bad friend. My family just thinks Iâ€™m being a bad family member. I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to live in the world any more. I just want to go to work and then come home and thatâ€™s it. I donâ€™t want to go have dinner with people anymore. I donâ€™t want to hang out and be made to feel obligated to stay until 11 pm before I can go home.  Nobody realizes that this is my way letting go of life, of escaping from the world.  Iâ€™m alone, Iâ€™m 30 years old and havenâ€™t had an intimate partner for a decade. I love those in my life tremendously. But I just want to let go. When Iâ€™m home, Iâ€™m free to be who I want. To feel how I want, to look how I want. I can say what I want, my cat doesnâ€™t mind. He doesnâ€™t judge. He looks up to me and needs me and heâ€™s the only thing thatâ€™s warm in my bed.  Thereâ€™s nothing more signifÃ­cate to write here. Just thank you for listening.', a user said: 'I relate so much to this - just existing and going through the motions and having to convince myself each day to get up and push through.  Itâ€™s exhausting and if it wasnâ€™t for my babies Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d be able to keep going.  Sorry for what youâ€™re going through, it sucks.  I hope things get better or at least easier.  ðŸ˜Š'"
