        "In response to 'Where I work, they grade you on 7-8 criteria on a 1-5 scale. If you get better than 3 on half or more, you automatically qualify for a ~5% raise. If you ever get 2 or more fives, you get put in the pool for management promotion. Needless to say, not a single person in our office of 20 has ever had more than two 4s on any review. No 5s. Why bother with the reviews if you’re just going to mandate that everyone gets an “average” score regardless of performance?', a user said: 'My current workplace is somewhat similar. We’re a nonprofit research institute and our annual raises are essentially set from the board. It’s 3-5% annually and almost never changes.\nWhat this does is make our management and their teams completely apathetic to the reviews since they do nothing. My manager literally wrote “xxxx does a great job, no notes” in my summary this year and we just talked about gardening and baseball in my 1:1 review time.'"
