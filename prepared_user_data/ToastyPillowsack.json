        "In response to 'To anyone struggling today,\nYou are a sensitive normal loving human being living in  and adapting to a dysfunctional society. Depression is a normal emotional response to this collapse in connection and open heartedness we're seeing.\nJust as you descended into depression, you CAN come back up and be without any long term negative feelings. The nature of things is change.\nI almost killed myself multiple times and now have not experienced negative emotions lasting longer than a day in over a year.\nGo deep within, and heal the wounds you have been holding onto. Only when we learn self love can we truly love others.\nWe need you and the wisdom you will gain by going through this ❤️', a user said: 'I don't want to self love. Having to self love is literally a result of the collapse in connection you said in your first paragraph.\nAlso, what is it with people never being able to explain what self love is? Everyone says it's the most important thing of all fucking time, just as important as SELF help, SELF improvement, isolating self self self self self, but nobody can delineate a clear fucking process as to how one is supposed to SELF love.\nI'll just go jerk off. There's self love for you. I'm so tired of hearing this ambiguous mysterious unexplained advice. Next time someone says love yourself, I'm offing myself.'"
