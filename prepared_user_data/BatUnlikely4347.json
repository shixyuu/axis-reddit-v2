        "In response to 'Original Post: [Discussion] Pod Save America - \"Is Biden Quiet Quitting?\" (12/17/24) [External Link]: https://crooked.com/podcast/is-biden-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'Favs was\nshockingly\nignorant about the prison abolitionist movement. Why not have Deray on from Pod Save the People? Or Olay Olurin? Plenty of folks would be willing to articulate what the movement is about.\nHe's been disturbingly off since the election. Reactionary, defensive, vaguely conservative and angry at the left side of the party. It's crazy you have a progressive media network and you don't have a clue what some of these issues are really about.'"
