        "In response to 'I had originally heard the term to describe people who were more like putting a mouse jiggler on to stay active on teams then lying out in the garden for the afternoon or whatever. Which I think basically is quiet quitting. Doing the bare minimum not to get noticed/sacked while still getting full pay. Seems like itâ€™s turned into a way to describe people just doing their job with no extras though.', a user said: 'Doing the bare minimum to not get sacked and being a mouse jiggler aren't the same thing.\nI'm a mouse jiggler, my job still gets done. I've just discovered that when I'm WFH and don't have any distractions I can hit my targets in 4-6 hours (depending on the day). My stats are as good, if not better than my colleagues.\nI just don't see why the reward for me finishing my work should be more work.'"
