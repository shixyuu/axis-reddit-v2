        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Amazon There's a movement not really just Amazon but work in general since inflation is going so high, people are just giving up trying extra or doing more hard work than what's necessary. Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'I never believed when people older than me would say, “It’s never about what you know it’s about who you know” and that couldn’t be more true at Amazon. When I first started, as others have said, working hard came naturally to me as I knew the only way my bills were going to get paid is if I kept my job (I’ve been homeless in the past). You really can’t turn survival instinct off. What I learned and often tell any new-hires, is PLEASE don’t work hard physically. Focus more on networking, standing out. For every 1 Area Manager, there’s hundreds of employees. Whether you like it or not, you have to become an asset. Be the “yes” man for a short while, it’ll pay back in dividends and in the form of you being able to work on more mentally stimulating stuff. That’s it, that’s the secret sauce. Suck it up for a while, play their game and once you’ve gotten what you wanted, just coast from there. I wasn’t noticed at first either and it was so aggravating because I knew I could run circles around those that were indirects or PA’s who probably couldn’t tell you which way is north or south. Go with the grain for a bit, what do you have to lose?'"
