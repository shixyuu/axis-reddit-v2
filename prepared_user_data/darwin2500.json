[External Link]: https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/09/09/analysis-shows-quiet-fleecing-us-workers-not-quiet-quitting-real-problem', a user said: 'That is how capitalism is 'supposed' to work.  If each worker is more productive, fewer are needed to produce the same output, and demand goes down.  When demand goes down and supply stays the same, prices drop.\nCapitalism is a good way to prices products and a terrible way to price people.'"
