I see terms like this come out of America quite frequently. Some one comes up with something stupid like this 'quiet quitting' and acts like they invented the phenomenon when a the English language already had a perfectly good term for this; in this case work-to-rule.\nAnother good example of this is 'cancel culture'. This is just boycotting. Stop making stupid terms up please.'"
