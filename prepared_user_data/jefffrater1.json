        "In response to 'They say people don't quit jobs, they quit management.\nMany of us can empathize with your situation of having management that is non-conducive to the job you are tasked with doing.', a user said: 'This is 100% true for me in the majority of my many employer changes over the past 25 years. Even in my present role, a dream role I’ve been wanting for a long time, I’m tempted to quit almost weekly because my boss, who’s 16 years my junior, poorly communicates, is easily frustrated and unconsciously finds scapegoats for every glitch. I find myself in this weird position where I’m trying to give leadership and guidance from below. But when the frustration and ire gets pointed at me - I get really tempted to take myself elsewhere.\nTake home message for anyone reading this thread - if you are a manger/leader in your organization spend some time studying servant leadership and put most your effort into honing those skills. Everything else will be easier and fall into place more quickly with the right people skills.'"
