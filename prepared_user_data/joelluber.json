        "In response to '\"Winning is easy, son; governing is harder.\"\nI don't want to say that the Taliban winning outright is in any sense good--but it did cause the organization to face a test that it never had before and it was woefully unprepared to handle. Governing is a much harder task than simply winning the right to govern, and the Taliban having a bit of a \"put up or shut up\" kind of moment here really takes the wind out of its sails. This is why it's so important to allow the winners to govern. Either they rise to the challenge and figure it out, or they prove themselves unfit and are replaced by someone who is.\nThe wrench there is that the Taliban proving itself unfit is way more concerning than other political entities simply being not good at their job. But overall the point that the Taliban probably isn't best defeated by military invasion rings true. Afghanistan is going through a period of metamorphosis and it's messy and horrible, but there's real hope that they are sowing the seeds of success in the future.', a user said: 'The Taliban governed for almost ten years before 9/11. Was that time different than now?'",
        "In response to 'Not like this. They were never the official government of the country, just always a regional power that was only accountable to itself. This is way different.', a user said: 'The Taliban controlled 80 percent of the country in 2001.'",
        "In response to 'Well, last time I checked, 80% is not 100%. And the 20% they didn't control was the \"official\" government.', a user said: 'Yeah, but they're were acting as the de facto government in most of the county. That's my point. They had history performing the role of governing. ðŸ¤¦\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan_(1996%E2%80%932001)'"
