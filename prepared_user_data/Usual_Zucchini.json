        "In response to 'What is the alternative?', a user said: 'Working smart, but not necessarily hard.\nI don’t think I’m a hard worker. I have friends who complain about all the overtime they do, how they’re answering emails on their vacations, etc. and they’re all miserable.\nI don’t have my work email on my phone, by choice. It’s not a boundary I’m willing to cross. I can count on one hand the times I worked after 5pm out of my own free will (I’m referring to jobs that have a typical 9-5 schedule here; I’ve certainly worked nights, weekends and holidays when I was younger and in a different industry.)\nI planned my entire wedding on work time without ever falling behind on my actual work. The key is, I LOOK busy. And I’m great at managing my time. I’ve created processes that save myself time, and then I share them with others which makes me seem selfless and like I care about the outcome of the work. Which, I do for the the most part, but not at my own expense.\nIf someone offers to train me on a new skill or process, I will take them up on the offer ONLY if I can see this skill or process benefiting ME in my next job search. If they’re offering because they’re too lazy or unmotivated to do it themselves, or because they’re wanting me to do the work of other people without hiring more people, I decline.\nOh yeah, I also say no to stuff. I have no fear whatsoever that I will get let go if I decline. Usually because I make myself an investment to the company ( which is clearly demonstrated by my productivity, willingness to help others, and ability to learn multiple new skills and processes) that I know if I were to be fired, they’d have a hell of a time replacing me.\nI’m almost never stressed out at work. I come home and enjoy my life. My workaholic friends are not only miserable outside of work, but they’re not very effective employees, either.'"
