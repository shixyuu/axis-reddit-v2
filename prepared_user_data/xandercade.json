        "In response to 'Unless and until you see a consistent pattern of an employer tangibly rewarding hard work, don't work hard. Most employers reward hard work only with more work.', a user said: 'Worked at a cell site service company. One guy was a really hard worker, and it paid off because we were hourly and regularly clocked 4-5 hours a day in just drive time to work sites. Average \"worked\" hours a week was 70+, we also got per diem and mileage.\nWell they approached him saying they were going to make him a tech trainer, his job title wouldn't change but he would become salary, but still keep mileage, etc.\nHe told them he was not gonna take a pay cut and take on more work, salary meant he'd go from roughly 1900 a week to 1300, (excluding mileage and per diem from both weeklies cuz it varied). They argued that the extra benefits would make up for that and they could Alter his duties as needed, to this day I am surprise he kept as calm as he did while he explained that he had an employment contract with his current terms and any change meant negotiations on a new/updated employment contract including compensation and benefits. Charlie Daniel's Jr good ole boy turned into a Harvard Lawyer in a split second, it was amazing.'"
