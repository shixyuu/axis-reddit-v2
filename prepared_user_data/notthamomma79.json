For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I call it working your wage. Now I have never had a problem going above and beyond my job duties however I will not bend over backwards or break myself for a company who barely pays me a living wage.\nI also refuse to be taken advantage of when I know should I go down because of my health or any other reason they will have my position filled in a matter of minutes.\nThey expect employees to have this fanatical loyalty to a company that does not come close to that level of care with their employees.\nIt's not quiet quitting it's called working my wage and keeping to my job duties'"
