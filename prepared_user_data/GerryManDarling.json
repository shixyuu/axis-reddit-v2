        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'The collapse of Thailand's economy in 1997 had a significant impact on the global financial crisis. Fortunately, a recovery followed in 1998. However, if the world's second-largest economy, China, were to collapse or experience a slowdown, it would certainly have a devastating influence on the West, despite attempts at diversification. Unlike the recovery seen in 1998, it is unlikely that a similar rebound would occur in this situation.\nIf the decoupling between China and the West were to occur gradually, there might be a chance for a \"soft landing.\" However, considering the poor decisions made by both China and Western nations, it is doubtful that such a smooth transition would take place. The positive aspect is that for a massive economy to collapse, it would take years before the consequences fully manifest. Therefore, I believe a recession is still a few years away.'"
