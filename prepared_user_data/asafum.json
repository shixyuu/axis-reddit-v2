I too have been trying to get stable housing (buying a house) and I was wondering where all the foreclosures I've been hearing about were. Well go figure, I go on an auction website and there are 20x the number of houses\nthere\nthan there were simply \"for sale.\"\nAll the houses for sale are 300k+ for a dilapidated shed, while almost\nall\nof the houses on auction were\nCASH ONLY\nand start at 120k... For fucks sake only investors are allowed to get an affordable house?! What the actual fuck is going on here?\nI get that price\ncan\ngo up in an auction, but I've watched a few of them and they didn't hit that 250-300k mark...'"
