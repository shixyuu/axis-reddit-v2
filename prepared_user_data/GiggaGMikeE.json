        "In response to 'but doesnt this blade swing both ways?\nif you dont have to live near where you work, couldnt your employer hire outside of conventional borders? why hire you to work remote, when an employer can hire someone with your skillset from another (cheaper) country to work remote?\nof course your own personal skillset will differentiate you from others, but thats true no matter the situation.\nwhats to stop corporations from just essentially outsourcing all of their remote work?', a user said: 'Outsourcing very rarely works out, especially when it comes to IT work. I've had three different roles that eventually went the outsourcing route(I actually helped train our replacements and left the sinking ship before they started giving people the axe) and all three either went under or reverted back to in house/third party IT within 3 years. Outsourcing seems like a brilliant idea, except customer service is important and that the outsourced labor can be cutting just as many corners as you are by hiring them.\nThat isn't meant to disparage overseas workers. They are doing what they need to have themselves and their families survive. That said I've never seen work delegated to a call center or other outsourced team that stayed at the same level as it was when you actually spent real money hiring professionals(typically it degrades). All it does is leave your end users pissed off, your IT management pissed off, and any customers who have to deal with the end result of your cost cutting measures pissed off.'"
