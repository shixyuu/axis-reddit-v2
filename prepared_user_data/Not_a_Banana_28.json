        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'This is not quiet quitting. This is literally doing\nyour\nend of the job. The customer is not blameless. You are not obligated to call them. You're absolutely right, they received at least 5-10 notifications in-app since you accepted their order. It's 100% the customer's responsibility to be available to receive it\non time\nThe customer is trying to make their laziness your fault.'"
