They were hiring at 10.50 then REDUCED to 10 because that's what their market research told them was the area's average. Yet from living in the area I know that's false and gave appropriate feedback to the out of town corporation. As a GM I was making 45k/yr plus bonuses. But considering I couldn't hire anyone on including regular restaurant turn over, I was working 70/hrs a week. That brought me to just over 12/hr. My key holders were making more than me. Significantly more than me when you factor in OT that I wasn't eligible for as a salaried employee. When I quit I gave a month's notice because it was obligatory in my contract. \nNow I've been at a local joint that takes care of it's employees for 3+ years and they are paying very competitive wages. I'm making more, doing less, working right under 40/wk.', a user said: 'I hope you went back to 40 hours at least for the last month.'",
