        "In response to 'Doing their job duties ONLY within their work hours.', a user said: 'I come into work around 0700-0730 and I leave at 1500-1530. Everyone else works till 1700 or beyond. I did this before the pandemic started to ease my commute and it just carried over through the pandemic. My boss knows and doesn't care. I will monitor emails and IMs on my work phone. But unless it is a director or an emergency I am away from my desk from 1500 to 1700 everyday.\nThey will have to drag me kicking and screaming from my desk if they try to fire me. I love the freedom my company gives me. They are also a large international company with over 80k employees all over the world.'"
