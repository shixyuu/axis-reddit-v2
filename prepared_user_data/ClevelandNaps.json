        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of workâ€”life balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'Because the work-life balance is nonexistent in many workplaces.\nI am in my late 30s, and some of the upper management where I work (nearly all white males in their 50s) are constantly complaining that people \"don't want to work\", \"don't understand what a job is\", \"don't deserve praise\", \"are lazy\", etc.  The area I work in is extremely short-staffed, with high staff turnover.  They do not accept that their behavior and the toxic environment and unrealistic expectations are the problem.\nMost recently, they complained that 'this generation' is the issue and doesn't want to do their work.  I said that it isn't that the staff don't want to work, it is just that they know to value their health (mental, physical, emotional) more than a paycheck.  And that if they are working in a bad environment, they don't owe it to anyone to stay.'"
