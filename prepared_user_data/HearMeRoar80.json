        "In response to 'Original Post: When you quiet quit/ride it out till you get fired, it negatively affects others in this community I had a teammate who had been dropping the ball for a while and was finally let go this week. His output was so bad that my manager noticed and did some digging. Turns out he barely worked at all and was clearly just coasting till he got fired.\nWell, my manager and skip are PISSED and literally called out how they think our old teammate was working multiple jobs. In my xp, they definitely were as they had many signs.\nRegardless, it’s now coming back to bite my team and me with new policies. Yes I’m pushing back on all the BS coming our way and trying to minimize it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if activity monitoring software came up soon to flag suspicious activity as well. This gig has been great for OE for years and now it’s in jeopardy because someone couldn’t just quit when they were done… I have friends (OE and not) at multiple other companies who are dealing with fallout like this as well.\nMy point being, when you pull the anti work card and coast like this just waiting to be fired (which I see recommended here daily), it’s not an isolated event. You get your bag a bit bigger and your teammates (and fellow OEers) deal with the fallout.\nIt helps to push for more RTOs that may have not as it eliminates the possibility of many of these issues. This also affects remote offerings (wayyyy down from what I’m seeing myself in new job hunts)\nHow would you feel if others put your extra paycheck(s) in jeopardy?\nGet your bag, but don’t screw others over while you do it.', a user said: 'Agree, OE != anti-work. In fact most successful guys that OE probably are excellent at their job, they certainly don't burn bridges when they are done with a J.'",
        "In response to 'Yup. Because you become too important as a contributor that it becomes hard to move you out of your role cuz while busting your ass turns out you do the work of 3 people, lol.', a user said: 'so true, it happened to me at J1. Was promised promotion by senior leadership person because I do top tier work. I worked super hard and became the \"go to guy\" for half of the stuff in our department. After 10 years, the senior leadership person retired and promotion is never even mentioned by leadership anymore. That's when I started OE out of spite. Now I do about 10% of the work I used to do at J1.'"
