        "In response to 'I wonder how they can age us out when so many of them don’t want to work, and the boomers are all retiring. Won’t they need senior leaders?\nI have been in hospitality my entire career and it sucks - I am so over the expectation that I have to pick up the slack or help when we are short staffed; “duties as assigned” is the biggest boomer scam. Basically means working evenings and weekends the entire peak / tourist season with “lieu days if you work an 8 hour shift” and no other compensation.\nQuiet quitting for me means saying no, I will not work these extra hours for free. I will leave early on a Friday if I have to work extra hours, I will ensure I get MY TIME back.', a user said: 'A bunch of boomers boomeranged. they retired, and the reality of the 401K they accepted in place of their pension hit them. They had nowhere near the income they thought they would. And all the social security destructive laws they gleefully cheered for ate up their money instead of everyone else's' money. So many went back to work and others chose not to retire upon seeing this.\nI am older Genx, and things started looking up. higher positions appeared to open up and the big money was looking possible. but they closed that door too.'"
