        "In response to 'Burnt out, yes. Considering a completely different career path. Monthly quota is wearing me down — especially not hitting it these past few months — the pressure looms outside of work and the dread coming back on a Monday isn’t healthy.\nI’m still relatively young (4 years out of uni) but as an introvert I don’t know if I can mentally handle being a full cycle rep of making 50 calls a day plus doing demos and closing deals.\nI love being rewarded for your performance unlike other jobs, and I get to build trust with people and help solve their problems, and I enjoy the grind. But with so many things out of my control (DMs pushing deals months out) it’s freaking tough to keep level headed. I realize why the drinking culture is so rampant in sales.\nI honestly don’t know what to do — been in my role 6 months, I’m building better habits around sleep, mental health, eating, and exercise but I haven’t seen a lasting change. I’m normally an anxious person so I’ll admit maybe I’m just not cut out for the constant pressure sales brings when you’re not doing well.', a user said: 'I hear you. I’m not working for a company but I know the pain of being an introvert in an extrovert world. You can do the job but it’s just so darn exhausting. I’m going back to school to get my bachelors and masters for Counselling psychology. It’ll be a long journey but I think it’s worth it in the long run.'",
        "In response to 'Thanks for sharing. I’m actually considering going back to school for either Psychology, a Physician’s Assistant, or Computer Science. Not an easy decision but as you said it will be worth it in the long run doing something with more purpose and aligns with an introverts skills.', a user said: 'I wish I could get into Comp Sci but it’s a little too dry for me. So many of my friends though that made it in the industry have had such great experiences and low stress jobs.'"
