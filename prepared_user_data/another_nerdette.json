        "In response to 'Original Post: I think my remote team mate is quiet quitting And it's ticking me off. Need advice if I should say something?\nMy team is fully remote,  spread  across the US. Our individual and team metrics are tracked by the amount of tickets we process on a weekly basis. This is a FULL time job and I've found that a member of our team is only logging about 4 hours a day - if that! Meanwhile, the rest of the team is putting in 9 hr days just to keep up with the volume.  We've also had to log in and work the last two Saturdays just to clear the backlog.  If this person would just work a normal day,  it would lighten the load on each of us. Our manager hasn't seemed to notice that this  person's \"numbers\" are half of what the other team members are producing. Do I speak up or keep my trap shut,  silently seething all day?\n**Thank you everyone for your input! I'm not going to do my managers job for them,  if they don't care,  I won't care either.  I'll hit my targets and focus on my career advancement in 2025.', a user said: 'I agree with the comments saying you might not know their circumstances.  It’s also the case that everyone else shouldn’t have to work more than 8 hour days if that’s a standard workday.  I would talk to your manager and emphasize that you need another person on your team to cover the workload.  The manager can figure out the best way to get more people hours.\nIf it were me I would just refuse to do anything past 8 hours.  I choose to bike my wife to and from her job because it bookends my days with hard stops.  I’m not looking for a promotion, so I will do good work for the time I’m paid and that’s it.'",
        "In response to 'You sound like the actual problem. First of all, it's none of your business as to what your teammates do, you're not their manager. Second of all, the actual manager should hire more employees. The fact that you and your other coworkers are overworking yourselves to keep up, you're giving the manager an excuse to not hire more employees. And logging in on Saturdays to clear the backlog? Yeah the job that did that to me I quit quickly afterwards. Have some self respect for yourself like the guy that works 4 hours a day and has a life outside of work. A job that would fire you in a heartbeat leaving you with nothing and no life because you decided to focus on work instead.', a user said: 'This is harshly worded, but very correct.  Doing extra unpaid work lets the company get away with not hiring more people.  OP, the only way to get this to stop is to stop doing unpaid work.'"
