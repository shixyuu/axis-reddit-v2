        "In response to 'Huh pretty interesting idiom, per Gemini:\nWhile \"steel rice bowl\" isn't a direct saying on its own, it's very closely related to a significant idiom in Chinese culture: \"iron rice bowl\" (鐵飯碗 - tiě fàn wǎn).\nThe \"iron rice bowl\" is a metaphor for a job with guaranteed job security and stable benefits, akin to life tenure. Traditionally, this referred to positions in the civil service, state-owned enterprises, and the military. The idea is that an iron bowl is unbreakable, ensuring that one will always have rice (i.e., a livelihood).\nTherefore, while not the exact phrase you asked about, the concept of a durable, reliable bowl is indeed used in Asian cultures, particularly Chinese culture, to symbolize job security and a stable means of earning a living. A \"broken rice bowl,\" on the other hand, signifies losing one's job.', a user said: 'It's not too different from English concept of bread as a staple. Breadwinner putting bread on the table and dealing with bread and butter issues.\nEnd of the day people gonna eat.'",
        "In response to 'The chinese have actually written some very very interesting and thought provoking literature on this modern work/life phenomenon in their cities. There are other forms of media like films/mini series, documentaries, manga etc... that are dedicated to this subject (sadly mostly in chinese/mandarin). The subject is very well researched and debated in china but can be easily confused and or regarded as a reflection of what the japanese have been experiencing since the 80s.', a user said: 'Do you have any recommendations of the manga? (Mandarin is fine)'"
