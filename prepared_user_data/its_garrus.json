        "In response to 'Original Post: What happened with quiet quitting? I'm definitively going to start quiet quitting this next month. I'm not proud to work at my current company (quite the opposite) and my boss thinks he's paying to make me his slave.\nBut I was looking for tips on how to start quiet quitting here on Reddit and I could only find old posts. It seems like it's not a thing anymore. Is quiet quitting dead? What have I missed?', a user said: 'I want to quietly quit but I was never given a specific list of tasks to do when I was put into my current position. I’m basically administrative assistant (read: work bitch) So if refuse to do anything I’m probably written up and fired.'"
