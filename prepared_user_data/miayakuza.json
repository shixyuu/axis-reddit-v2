        "In response to 'Original Post: I think my remote team mate is quiet quitting And it's ticking me off. Need advice if I should say something?\nMy team is fully remote,  spread  across the US. Our individual and team metrics are tracked by the amount of tickets we process on a weekly basis. This is a FULL time job and I've found that a member of our team is only logging about 4 hours a day - if that! Meanwhile, the rest of the team is putting in 9 hr days just to keep up with the volume.  We've also had to log in and work the last two Saturdays just to clear the backlog.  If this person would just work a normal day,  it would lighten the load on each of us. Our manager hasn't seemed to notice that this  person's \"numbers\" are half of what the other team members are producing. Do I speak up or keep my trap shut,  silently seething all day?\n**Thank you everyone for your input! I'm not going to do my managers job for them,  if they don't care,  I won't care either.  I'll hit my targets and focus on my career advancement in 2025.', a user said: 'I don't see one comment I agree with. WFH is becoming less and less common due to these types of shenanigans coming from your coworker. There are ways to subtly hint to your manager that a coworker is not pulling their weight without singing like a bird. People who are calling you a rat or are saying you are the problem are probably just as bad as this guy. I personally would say something in a subtle way if your manager continues to do nothing about it.'",
        "In response to 'No it's not. At all.\nYou're making shit up about what is causing WFH to trend one way or another.', a user said: 'Lol. If you think corporate America trusts you and doesn't want to control you, you are simply naive.  There are many reasons that wfh is fading, and lack of trust and the desire to control employees are two of the big ones.'"
