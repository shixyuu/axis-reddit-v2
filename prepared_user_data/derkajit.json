        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'Don’t listen to the advice from redditors here, myself included, and especially the piss-poor anti-work, leave-me-alone, gimme freebies type.\nThe new person did nothing wrong, and especially not to you. Why would you want them to flounder?\nInstead of comparing yourself to new hires - get an honest feedback about your prospects within the company. You are the only one who was NOT let go, obviously, they see something in you. Don’t take “no” for an answer: understand why you were not promoted, and what is the path to broader responsibilities, assuming you want that.\nPromotions have two components:\n- there needs to be an opportunity.\n- you need to be ready.\nGiven that they extended an external offer, seems like it’s the latter. So you need to ask why. If you’re not getting anywhere and getting vibes that nobody cares about you as a person - look for a new job. Otherwise, understand why you couldn’t get what you want and see if you agree.\nNote: this is all assuming you’re not an asshole, and based on the fact that you were the only one not fired I assume you’re not.'"
