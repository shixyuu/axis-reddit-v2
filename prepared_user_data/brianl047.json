It's probably the same now.\nGen Z is looking for skills and learning opportunities. They will give up everything including money for this.\nReally you don't have to worry about quiet quitting because in a knowledge worker job 20% to 50% of your time is spent down or learning. It's only the businesses that don't allow this (and don't reward learning or skills) that will have a huge problem. If your company has a skill problem or doesn't reward gaining skills (hard skills soft skills any skills) you're out of touch and will be fucked by people just refusing to adhere to your company specific processes. Even company specific processes can be a skill.'"
