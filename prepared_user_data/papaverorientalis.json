        "In response to 'It kind of reminds me of one of the things mentioned at a PLC meeting. Tiktok has rewired their brains to be ADD and unable to focus without constant stimulus.\nThey then say we need to adjust our teaching to this. My rebuttal is that we need to help fix this. We shouldn’t be caving to their craven need for entertainment at every moment, we should be helping fix their brains the rot has produced.', a user said: 'I agree. I teach Art and because certain students work faster than others / try to rush to be “finished,” etc, there are sometime natural lulls. I’ve tried to use those moments to encourage the students to “take a second look” at what they’ve done or to add more. Getting students to stop and reflect is sometimes easier said than done.\nThe need to “finish” and move on to the next is stifling for the creative process sometimes.'"
