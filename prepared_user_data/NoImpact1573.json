Absolute burden on our department, never reads emails, scrounges help off others even though he was at the training meeting (doesn't listen and says nothing), makes a complete arse of complex projects that we all bail him out. Never helped himself, basically lazy/switched off during his work hours\nNowadays he ends up with all the crap tasks, and keeps out of the way of the management.\nI think he is a bit depressed in all honesty. However, he is in for a big shock, as the quitting (not his choice) part is coming soon (seen the severance packages) and I don't think he will be quiet about it. Had a good run tbh.\nBasically my opinion, if you feel like that in a job - it's probably time to go and not drag it on. Get motivated for a new role.'"
