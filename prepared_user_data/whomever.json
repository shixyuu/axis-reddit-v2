        "In response to 'Now its time for Frenzy firing?', a user said: 'Yup. Then they realize they scaled back too far when productivity tanks one or two quarters from now, and the remaining experienced staff leave. Then the less experienced but cheaper staff can't match the prior productivity or quality standards level. Followed by the consumer base noticing a drop in quality and service responsiveness, alongside higher costs, and then demanding price concessions or they are going to competitors.\nI actually have seen my cost of living slightly decrease in spite of inflation the last couple of years as many companies that I used before now offer such poor service, value, or product quality that I completely stopped using them.'",
        "In response to 'Those companies sound like they produce items that you bought using disposable income. I canâ€™t imagine that your core purchases of food, housing, or car payment have decreased. Have you considered that you had to cut out purchases or make different lifestyle choices simply because necessities have skyrocketed?', a user said: 'Necessities have skyrocketted. However, an example of an expense I stopped buying is fast food and dining out at several restaurants. Most of the restaurants that I liked developed staffing issues that made it not worthwhile to eat out.\nMy time is far too valuable and scarce for me to sit in a drive thru for 30 minutes, or in a sit-down restaurant for 2 hours during an off-peak dining time because a foodservice company decides to not staff adequately.\nIn addition, the food quality is significantly lower now,  with less items available, smaller portion sizes, and often undercooked, overcooked or even cold items that should be warm being served.\nI can afford food. I have two full-time jobs. But I'm not wasting my time or paying for inedible crap.'"
