        "In response to 'Original Post: Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing. They just called it “mailing it in” and the movie Office Space is a commentary on this.', a user said: 'Gen X’er here and I can confirm. I generally like my job, my boss, my clients, etc., but that’s not my life. I have certainly gone above and beyond when it was really needed, and I still will. I refuse to do extra on normal days when there are no real emergencies. I much prefer to spend my time with my husband, dogs, & friends doing things we all enjoy doing.'"
