        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet Quitting”, not quite quitting, but forcing employers to adapt. [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: 'I believe this used to be called work to rule.\nAnd maybe if employers want their employees to care, they should treat them and pay them properly.\nThey have no problem treating and paying their executives properly, they just don't seem to give a crap about the regular employees.\nCEO salaries have risen 940% since 1978 while employee wages have gone up 12%. So really, these companies that are crying about not being keep employees, or about their employees \"quietly quitting\" probably need to stop complaining and start paying their employees properly. If they can't afford it, they'll find a big surplus in the CEO salary line item of their budget.\nReference for %s:\nhttps://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-compensation-2018/\nI say this as someone who is an employer.'"
