        "In response to 'Im in the UK and i did my own version of Quiet Quitting 30 years ago - i arrived at 9 and left at 5\nI had one colleague (Dean) who did the same job - arrived early and left late regularly but his figs showed he did about 20% less work (results wise) - he was very chummy with the boss and wasted a lot of time chatting\nSo at my appraisal my boss had a go about my attitude to houyrts and i repleid that i still got 20% more done - and he aaid \"Yes but imagine if you did the same hours as Dean - how much more youd do then\nSo i said \"So how much more would you pay me than Dean then?\" - and he sat silent\nI got up and said (I had balls in those days) - I think you need to reward your workers not your arse lickers - I handed my notice in a month or two later', a user said: 'I overheard a branch manager saying how he had an employee that only averaged 39 hours a week (it's not uncommon for 50+ in the position). So he fired them. Nothing about not getting work done, or being unavailable when needed. My first thought was so you fired the guy that could do work on time and under budget?\nMy last year with that company we got a new branch manager. Come raise time, I was told I'd have to take on more responsibility if I wanted a raise. So I did, by quitting and starting my own business working contract. Same work, a bit more accounting, double the hourly rate.'"
