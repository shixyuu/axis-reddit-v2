Some might depend of the current usage or batterie of the phone\nThis woman could have been on her phone browsing reddit and not receive any. And that's if notifications from this app are even allowed on her phone.', a user said: 'Then you put a note:\" please call when here\" in the delivery instructions.\nI deliver and order so i know both sides.\nI sure as shit don't order food if i can't get notifications for some unlikely reason.\nWhy do idiots order food and then never check on progress on the app, \nWhen i order i have my phone on me until it arrives and frequently look to see how close they are.\nWhy do idiots just order and then pay no attention to the app or time?\nI think the pandemic has created a lot of ignorant people who rarely if ever ordered delivery so they do seem to get how it works.'"
