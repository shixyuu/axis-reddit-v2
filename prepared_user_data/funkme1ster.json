        "In response to 'Repeat after me, Quiet Quitting is not a thing.\nIt's definitely a thing, it's a new name for an old labour action,\nwork-to-rule.\nI remember when teachers used to announce they were going on Work to Rule.  They'd send home forms to parents basically saying all school field trips are cancelled, any pencils or papers teachers used to provide will no longer be provided, stuff like that.', a user said: 'I really feel they're different things.\nWork-to-rule is more of an active and deliberate contradiction where workers make a show of explicitly following the letter of obligations for the purposes of highlighting the differences between what they provide and what they're required to provide.  It's done as a form of passive aggression in the context of two sides being at odds.  Work-to-rule is a method, not a goal, and when the goal is achieved the method is ended.\nThe phenomena \"quiet quitting\" (I hate that term so very much) describes is more of a self-actualized complacency of people who have no particular ill will or desire to antagonize their workplace, but have simply acknowledged the return on investment for doing more isn't worth it so they won't.  It's people saying \"I don't personally\nwant\nto do more, and the compensation of a smile and thanks isn't adequate compensation for the labour expended doing more, so I will choose not to do more because it's not worth it\".  They won't be unprofessional or contradictory in doing the things they are reasonably asked to do, they just won't do anything else.  Unlike work-to-rule, quiet quitting\nis\nthe goal, so the only way to stop it is to provide a preferable goal to switch to.\nAnd yes, I do particularly enjoy the irony that the way employers can dissuade \"quiet quitting\" is by voluntarily doing more than is required of them.'"
