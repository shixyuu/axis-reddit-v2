        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'As someone who has been bullied at every job I've had except one, and witnessed corporate mentality at its worst, people who use this phrase can fuck right off.\nI've had bosses like this, ones who try to use fear to make you stay beyond your shift, ones who If you were to cut them in half, they'd have the company logo on their insides. The ones who think that because they go above and beyond, everyone should, and that no matter your abilities, if you can't keep up or stay as focused as they are, then you are lazy scum.\nI've seen good people get sucked into the mentality too, if you do more, you'll get noticed, right? Promotion? Maybe thanks at least? No.\nI saw one of my older friends get the reward they sought in the form of more work and no mention of the efforts they put in at all. Eventually they ended up with PTSD and a heart condition linked to the stress.\nI tried to 'do my part' once. But when it came to asking for promotion I was told I was too soft. In they end it was like a playground gang from school, the popular people get the promotion and get to be 'quietly quitting' with management's blessings. The rest of us had to pick up the slack or be bullied to hell because apparently its quite hard to fire people in the UK.\nI still work there, but as a contractor looking from the outside now. It's still the same. If management are in, I will 'quietly quit' because they don't deserve anything else. If a supervisor I'm friends with is on, I will do more for them, because they have my respect.\nThis is the way.'"
