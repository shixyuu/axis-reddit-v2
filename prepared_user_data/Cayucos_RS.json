        "In response to 'Well, I like working from home to avoid getting sick.  Not getting sick because A-holes com into the office when they are sick, is just great.  Then again, I am in a higher risk category, having had a heart surgery just before the pandemic.  So yeah, I am more concerned about preventable diseases being spread around.', a user said: 'Shame on you. Absolute shame for valuing your personal health over the companies bottom line and policies. Don't you know that execs need to have control over your life!? With employees working from home they have less control, even if they are more productive, and we simply cannot have that.\nI expect you to come into work sick or not so we can continue with this broken 9-5 prison system.\n/s'"
