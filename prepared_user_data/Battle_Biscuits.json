        "In response to 'I think it's more a US thing. Let me give you some context:\nMy US colleagues will regularly work over 40 hours, and generally speaking will bend over backwards more - like stay late or start early if it would be kind of helpful but not really necessary. They're not pushovers by any means, it's just that if you weren't doing it, you're the odd one out. It's part of the work culture there.\nHere, if I have stayed late in the past, I've got that time back the next day - and it's rare. Like it has to be really required. If I'm on a meeting and it's half 5, 8 times out 10 I'll say I've gotta here guys, let's pick this up tomorrow.\nSo for them quiet quitting would be actually impactful, I'm not so sure here. Doing what you're paid to do is typical. I think this has just made the opinion piece editorial mill in the UK purely because opinion piece writers are not working a typical job and just take cues on office life from american dramas or sitcoms ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. For the rest of us, don't think it's really relevant.', a user said: 'Interesting, sounds like it's another case of UK copying American discourse without realising that it doesn't apply to us.'"
