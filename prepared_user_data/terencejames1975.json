Been here 15 years, everyone did that little bit extra to make it a profitable site. Then they decided they could make it cheaper in China & India. We've literally done nothing wrong - site makes a healthy profit, always produces what is required on time. Some guy who has never even visited the site makes a decision and boom, you're out of a job. Makes me wish I'd quietly quit years ago.'"
