        "In response to 'New to corporate here but old to management fuck ups on both ends.\nKey here is to retort unprofessionalism with utmost professionalism. It's hard but it's the best option. Tell them that you don't have time to discuss the issue/that question during the presentation and that you'll 'try' to answer questions at the end of your presentation. Oh you ran out of time. You can direct questions to my email and I'll answer as soon as possible.\nProceed to quit then.\nIt's hard especially when OP had put so much work and been under so much stress and anxiety as of late but it's something to take going forward. If in doubt, give yourself time and space so you can answer properly later or at least strategise.', a user said: 'Agreed. Can't blame OP but can also understand someone not getting round to tons of pre-reads. Sounds like all the bureaucracy of the process is a big part of the problem. I'm sure OP wouldn't have responded the same if they didn't have to wait 83 days to have this meeting. And if everyone else's presentations are the same length that's 12 different topics that person needs to pre-read. Hell after 3 hours you could have forgotten what you did read'"
