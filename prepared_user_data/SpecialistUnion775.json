Almost one-third said their working environment made it impossible to communicate their intention to quit, while almost 25 percent said they feared their firm would react badly.\"\nIt turns out those draconian \"force employees back into the office and work a billion hours and don't take no for an answer\" routines are self-defeating and harmful just like\nthe MIT study found.\nWho knew?'"
