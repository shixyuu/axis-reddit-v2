Therefore, he is legit doing what they are asking of him, nothing more. Ain’t no shame in that game.', a user said: 'Depends on the company. Some dole out raises to everyone in good years. Then, in a down year start to take a hard look at where all the money went. Don’t make the mistake of thinking all these companies are doing things for a logical reason vs “this way is easier / more familiar”.'",
        "In response to 'I knew a guy that worked for two large corporations at the same time during Covid late 2020 into 2021. He did it for 8 months. No one at either company knew about it. He would be double booked for meetings but would only attend one and use a medical excuse for missing the other. He made a lot of money. He should write a book about it.', a user said: 'Lot of people did this, especially IT Helpdesk type people. Have 2 laptops going - switch between doing tickets for one or the other.'"
