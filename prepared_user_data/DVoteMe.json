        "In response to 'Nobody should do work outside of their listed job requirements.  If a place of business wants to add additional tasks, they can pay you more for them.', a user said: 'Yes. This is the textbook definition of quiet quitting.\nThe alternative is you do extra tasks and your supervisor is so afraid to lose you so they promote you and you get a raise.  I've even been given raises without promotions because I alluded to having opportunity elsewhere and they were afraid to lose me at that moment.\nThe modern worker has a choice.  Either pick time or money and the opposite will be your problem, but you are not going to get both unless you inherit it or are very fortunate.'",
        "In response to 'It’s incredible that the text book definition of quiet quitting is doing the job you were hired to do.', a user said: 'The catch phrase is new, but the concept is as old as time.  The only novel aspect is that this is being discussed in the context of exempt workers who in the past were stereotyped, in media, as Type-A yuppies; however, even among the exempt workers there were always some employees doing more or less than other employees.'",
        "In response to 'Sure. There always were those employees.  But it doesn’t mean there were promotions and raises in store for those employees.  The best promotion and raise is still a new job at a new company.\nAnyone’s best bet should be to do the job you were hired to do, do it well and be able to explain what and why you did it well on your resume and in an interview.', a user said: 'The best promotion and raise is still a new job at a new company.\nAn internal promotion is by people who know your work. An external promotion is by people who are desperate to find a body to fill a position.'"
