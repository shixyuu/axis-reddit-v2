        "In response to 'Because I operate an agricultural corporation where I am HR, the manager, the CEO, and a 60 hr a week line employee.  I can measure daily how much someone harvests relative to how much they are paid in wages, benefits, housing, etc.  agricultural employees are difficult to replace mid season because the competent ones are employed.  We pay substantially more than the highest minimum wages in the US and we provide raises commensurate with increases in wholesale produce prices.  Itâ€™s obvious when someone is producing less value than they are being compensated for.', a user said: 'You're operating under the assumption that \"quiet quitting\" means they aren't pulling their weight. The reality is these employees are doing exactly what their employment agreement requires of them. No more and no less. In other words, they are pulling their weight. They're just not doing anything extra because their employers do not compensate them in any way for doing that. And can you blame them?\nThese corporate puff pieces are lamenting that the current generation of workers doesn't let their bosses steamroll them into doing more than the original agreement (overtime without extra pay, extra responsibilities without commensurate raise or promotion, etc.)'"
