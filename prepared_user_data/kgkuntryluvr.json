        "In response to 'Woooh! Teacher win.\nSay it with me: We will not work for free.\nAgain for those in the back: WE WILL NOT WORK FOR FREE.\nIt is not our job for kids to have \"fun stuff\". Nor is it a doctor's, psychologist's, etc. job. We are professionals and deserve to be treated better. I hope this generation of teachers do better. We are not volunteers.', a user said: 'The crazy part is that there probably are others that could staff these type of events- parents, student teachers/interns, subs/TAs at their hourly rate . Yet, they always default to putting it on teachers before even looking elsewhere.'",
        "In response to 'If your contract has a defined start and end time, the assigned duties need to happen in those times. If the contract specifies that you can be assigned duties outside of those hours, what is the point of an end time?', a user said: 'I got into a debate with someone on here a while back on this very subject. They tried to argue that our contract hours are just the hours that we’re expected to be at the school- not the finite cutoff hours for doing work. I said the same thing as you. What’s the point of contract hours if we’re expected to work beyond them? They might as well not even include them in our contracts if that’s the case.'",
        "In response to 'Duties and hours are 2 different things. I'm not sure why that's mysterious to some people. In my district they pay us, or trade us time when they need us outside of contract hours.', a user said: 'Exactly. Duties should be competed within the paid hours. Unfortunately, that’s not how it works at many schools. As a PE teacher, we got stuck with the worst duty- afternoon bus duty. With the driver shortage, we were always stuck there at least 30 minutes after contract hours. That may not sound like much, but it’s 2.5 hours a week. Do the math for the entire school year and see how much of our time that equals. To make it worse, they wouldn’t even discuss rotating us with the other teachers. They never said it, but we know it was because of the ol’ trope that PE teachers should pick up the extra duties because we have it easy.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting is happening at my school You all have heard it around the world. Quiet quitting or \"simply doing your job and nothing else\" is going around. Anyway the Fall Fling dance rolls around and teachers are \"required\" to chaperone. Basically we are given a google form to sign up for a shift to chaperone the dance. No this isnt paid, yes its on a Friday night after a long work day and week, and no food is not provided to teachers. Total suckfest all around. Well get this, the day before the dance we get a frantic email from Admin. No one signed up to chaperone. NOT A SINGLE teacher signed up to chaperone. We get some messages about how this is mandatory, teachers must be there for the event, we can choose which shift we work but must be there. No one signs up. Cue Admin start walking door to door with a sheet asking people to sign up. Get this, the teachers stand their ground and say no. Of course a few caved, 1 or 2, but overwhelmingly the teachers say no.\n​\nGuess what happened, well they had the dance, the admin chaperoned, the few people that signed up, basically a skeleton crew. The next week nothing, no messages, no angry faculty meeting, nothing. They know that they cant do anything to the teachers because its not one or two, its everyone. Listen I understand that kids need fun stuff to do, but maybe don't make teachers do it, or if they have to be there pay them??', a user said: 'Love this! Teachers sticking together and holding their ground is the only way things will change. Since there will never be a nationwide strike, the least we can do is work to our contracts and nothing more. Pay us stipends or hire other people to cover the events not included in our contracts!\nThis also sounds like poor planning on admin’s part. They should have figured out the logistics before announcing it to the students. It just goes to show how accustomed they are to taking advantage of teachers. Bet they won’t be scheduling anything else until they’ve got proper staffing in place first.'",
        "In response to 'To me, quiet quitting is when I start putting in less and less effort into a job while I focus on finding a new one. Essentially using up all my sick days and vacation days. The boss suspects something but they don't know anything until they get my letter of resignation.\nI only do this when I REALLY hate where I work.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting sounds more like what I actually did- browsing Indeed during planning periods and putting on videos during class so I could fill out job applications lol.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'I prefer no terminology for it. Don’t give it air- it’s just doing your job! No need to even caveat it with “and nothing more” because that also implies that there’s something wrong with not going above and beyond and reaffirms that there’s an expectation for it.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'Please stop repeating this nonsense term. There’s no such thing as quiet quitting. It’s simply doing what is outlined in your job description- and nothing more. And yes, we should all be doing that.'"
