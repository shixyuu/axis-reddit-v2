        "In response to 'I agree about them being shallow. You can never have an honest, open, and deep conversation with any \"close\" JW friend for fear of saying something that they'll feel obligated to report to the elders. I contrast that with my former Navy shipmates who I can talk to about anything and know it stays between us and who'll offer sincere advice and help.', a user said: 'That must be a main reason for the lack of true friendship. Although you can pick ONE friend whom you tell everything, so there's only one witness, but that is some load to carry for them.'",
        "In response to 'This. So much! I have very few friends because the jw’s that I did try to befriend always ended up stabbing me in the back. It was always for stupid things and they’d twist my words around and then gossip, which would in turn get back to an elder.\n99% of the time, it was their fault for misunderstanding and jumping to conclusions because they only got a small portion of the full picture. So now, all I do is smile and rarely ever say anything personal, about myself or anyone else. I’m too old for that kind of drama. All I want at this point in my life is peace, which I have plenty of now that I’ve stepped back from JW Land. I just cannot tell you how much happier and less stressed I am since I’ve stopped attending meetings and service. It’s amazing!\nLooking back, I used to be one of those gossiping PIMI’s, so glad I woke up and decided to change. I no longer judge any of the friends either. I see them for them, and many of them struggle to keep up the PIMI game but just can’t admit it. My heart hurts for them and I always try to be very sympathetic towards their struggles.', a user said: 'Became a better Cristian by becoming a worse jw'"
