        "In response to 'At my wife's company the head of HR said this during a town hall, and that they would be delaying merit increases by another 6 months from the historical merit increase period. So effectively not meeting inflation and making employees wait 18 months for their increase.\nShe said she could see the motivation being sucked right out of the room. She saw performance of even the most motivated employees dwindle and overall attitudes towards the company decline, in less than a week. About 5% of the employees have left in the last 6 weeks.', a user said: 'This relates integrally to OPs post.\nIts mind boggling to me what older generations and current management thinks motivates people. 1) Yes we all want to be involved with a success, no one wants to spend their time in a failing endeavor. Just like people want to be on a championship team, almost everyone if given a choice would work somewhere that seemed “worthwhile” or cool or powerful over someplace boring, or low level, or hateful if all things are equal otherwise. 2) But it’s a job. It’s about money. 3) The only reason to go above and beyond is an attempt to potentially bank that effort in order to be potentially offered more money, a bonus, a raise, a promotion later. 4) When you said you could see the motivation being sucked out of the room. That’s management saying nope…you can’t have items 1, 2, or 3. They were saying, we don’t have a company that is successful, we’re a failing company, and second not only that but we’re going to underpay you by our own standards, and three you can forget about making a good living or professionally growing in any way while you’re here.'"
