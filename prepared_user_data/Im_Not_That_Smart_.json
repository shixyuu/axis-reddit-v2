I thought it was when you stopped doing your job, and underperformed but tried to wait out the clock to collect paychecks as long as you could before getting fired.\nBecause I know some places are very slow to fire people and you can get by doing very poorly for a long time before getting the axe. Like, my current job had a dude who was shit and would frequently be at their desk watching YouTube and reading the news, and it took over a year for them to get fired. And they only got fired because HR caught them taking days off without using vacation days. Who knows how long they could’ve continued being a terrible worker had they not been so brazen and tried to just not show up all the time.'"
