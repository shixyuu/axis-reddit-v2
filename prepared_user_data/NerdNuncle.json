        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'I’m all for it, but only when it’s deserved for lack of better words\nFor example, my present supervisor has rarely been anything less than professional, and owns up to her lapses. She’s trying her hardest with the limited, faulty resources at her disposal, so I give that job my very best. I’m convinced it’s why I’m still there\nOn the other hand, I had the misfortune of working for a family run store with owners insisting employee safety was not their responsibility, refused to take calls during emergencies despite living nearby, and demanded untrained employees work kitchens because the owners’s pride was more important than customer safety.\nDid the bare minimum and left them with a one week notice'"
