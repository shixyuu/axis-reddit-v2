        "In response to 'https://www.npr.org/2021/05/17/997462169/thousands-of-people-are-dying-from-working-long-hours-a-new-who-study-finds\nMaybe they aren't quiet qutting but just health conscious.\nWorking long hours poses an occupational health risk that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, the World Health Organization says.\nPeople working 55 or more hours each week face an estimated 35% higher risk of a stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from heart disease, compared to people following the widely accepted standard of working 35 to 40 hours in a week, the WHO says in a study that was published Monday in the journal Environment International.', a user said: 'I was working 60 hour weeks, every week, for about 3 months and it drove me absolutely insane. Like, hallucinating and shit. I realized my health was more important so I stopped doing that shit.\nThen Covid hit and I was again working 50-60 hour weeks. Same shit except this time I was using alcohol to stay sane... Not a great choice. So I switched to weed instead of booze and cut back my hours again.\nYou could say my weed usage and lack of working OT were related... But the actual causative variable was my health.'"
