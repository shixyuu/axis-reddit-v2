Since then I have chaperoned exactly two other dances.', a user said: 'Jfc I've been chaperoning at least one dance per year for 14 years and the only thing I ever got as compensation was a centerpiece from one prom lol.'",
        "In response to 'Jfc man you are blowing up my spot. I take the leftover flowers from the events to give to my wife.', a user said: 'Lol, well in my case, my cat ate a huge chunk of a lily and I had to panic until I figured out it was a nonpoisonous variety.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'If I worked my contract I'd never have my lessons written, work graded, prepping done.  I'd also never have to chaperone shit.'"
