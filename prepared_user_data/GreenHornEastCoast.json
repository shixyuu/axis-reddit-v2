To me the \"act your wage\" is a great way to describe today's workers.\nMy past taught me what a good work ethic was and what it can do for you. And how when preparations meets opportunity it gets called luck\nWorkers with this ethic are entirety different. I can't empathize or understand it.  But it explains a lot to me.  I am NOT judging it good or bad or right or wrong. It's so new.\nIn my life the \"work your wage \" concept was for \"special \" employees that one would never expect to advance. Not young people who are so different\nIn summary, act your wage workers have no hope or optimism in the work place.  Who wants to be around that?'"
