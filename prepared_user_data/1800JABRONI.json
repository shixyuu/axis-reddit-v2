I get exactly my salary and the number of days off I was promised. No, the cheapest pizza they can find a few times a year doesn't motivate me or make me feel cared for.\nIf there was a possibility of extra reward for going above and beyond, I'd consider doing it, but my company doesn't do that, so why exactly should putting in the bare minimum for the company be considered \"quiet quitting\" when my employer puts in the bare minimum for me?'"
