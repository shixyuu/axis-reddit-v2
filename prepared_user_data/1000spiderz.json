        "In response to 'Original Post: I tried quiet quitting before it was cool (2014). Worst idea ever. Here's my story 👋 A bit ashamed to share this & might get in trouble (might've been better to share this anonymously 💁‍♂️ but that's who I am); I'd rather be authentic.\nHeyo, I'm Jordan 👋\nIn 2013 I started my first enterprise engineering job.\nI was coming from startups, so 16-hour workdays and sleeping in the office were my day-to-day. Lots of work.\n​\nThe hiring process was easy (startups teach you a ton; we were making games — way more complicated than enterprise software). I was hyped to start.\nBut something quickly stood out to me – there wasn't much I could do. There was work for about 1, maybe 2 people MAX and the team was 10+.\nNot enough to sway me 💪, so I started improving things no one else was touching (we were not in HQ, and the guys in HQ were... territorial).\nSpent a few weeks improving some code and... had to send it over email (for programmers, this is ridiculous). No response.\nSecond email. No response.\nThird email. No response.\nTalked to my boss — not much else to do.\nMy days looked like:\n👉 2 hours of meetings\n👉 lunch\n👉 4 hours for meetings\n👉 2 hours left for work, but most were spent talking to colleagues (great people) because there wasn't much work\n​\nI coped with that by spending all of my time at work learning stuff. My computer was kind of shit, and there were enough limitations, so I was doing mostly theoretical learning online.\nThen the company started optimizing the team.\nSomething that they've been planning since before I joined was to change our primary technology. That wasn't something I wanted to do, and I was kind of pissed that no one mentioned it at the interview since they had this plan all along.\n​\nEnter Quiet Quitting\nUp until this point, I was trying to help out. I couldn't for the majority of my time and felt like the company is not giving me a good ground to do so, but I tried.\nAt that moment, I just said \"f*ck it!\" and decided to do the least possible.\nThe bad news?\nIt worked.\nI spent 2 years doing nothing. Absolutely nothing.\nNow, that might sound like a dream to some of you, but here's where it lead me:\n​\nThe results from quiet quitting\nSpending 8 hours of my day being a lethargic slug, turned the other 8 hours of my day into a lethargic slog.\nI didn't have any motivation to do anything.\nI didn't have any momentum to do anything.\nI didn't want to do anything.\n​\nAnd that comes from someone who spent his ENTIRE time writing code 🤦‍♂️\n​\nAfter finally leaving that job, I failed my next startup because I couldn't get myself to work. I forgot how.\n​\nI got into the biggest depression of my life. Thought about taking my life too. F*ck, it's painful to even remember that period.\n​\nIt took me the next 5 years to get back to square 1. To get my life in order. To get my habits in order. To start loving work again.\n​\nWhat to do instead\nDuring the last 8 years: I learned a lot, started writing, grew to the highest possible engineering grade (Principal Architect in my current company), started leading an excellent team of 15 people, and started making content to help others.\nHere's what I would've done if I had my knowledge back then:\n​\nTry changing things — do your best to change your current situation so your work gives you what you need — satisfaction, challenges, and/or money (I did that 🥳).\nℹ️ this happens by talking to people. I didn't do enough of this 😢\nNegotiate terms — find who you depend on and negotiate terms. Be ruthless. You are giving value to your company, and you deserve your company to take care of you. But you need to negotiate to make the terms clear and to improve them — no one will do it for you.\nFill your time with things that grow you — how you spend your days is how you live your life. Don't let yourself do nothing. Or you will fall in a hole you'll years to dig yourself out of.\nChange your company — don't settle. Job hunting is hard as hell, but you can do it. Improve your CV, work on your communication skills — you can do it!\n👋 Here to help with this\nBuild your own business — alternatively, don't quit and spend all of your time & energy on building your own company. You'll learn a lot and grow a lot. Even if it doesn't work.\nAgain, and I can't say this enough times — talk to people. Your communication will build your network. Your network is your net worth. In any company and outside.\n(here to help with that as well)\nI hope that was useful to you!\nYour biggest fan,\n— Jordan', a user said: 'My brother had a somewhat similar story. He basically built a bot that did his job and then hit a button to run it each day. Then he got depressed and felt really purposeless and thought he could start a business but just wasn't happy. Anyway, his company recently did a re-org and gave him a more hands-on job. Last time I saw him he had dropped a ton of the weight he had gained and the dark circles around his eyes were gone. I was worried about him for a minute there, but it seems like things are looking up. Thanks for sharing this. I hope you help some folks.'"
