Too bad my contract has \"and anything else that is required\" in the job description ><', a user said: '\"Other duties as required.\"\nShould be illegal.

So imagine getting a break from those deadlocks to wash a car and then still having to finish those deadlocks the next day and not get behind even more.'",
