I worked afternoons and if the midnight shifter no call no showed, I’d have to stay over and work 16hrs. I’d do this many times a week because we couldn’t keep midnight shifters. And at this company if you no call no show then the company takes that as your resignation. I’d call my manager, who was supposed to come in at least early, wouldn’t come in and people on first would be “drunk already” so they couldn’t come in. I’d see my manager twice. What did I get? NOTHING. A sympathetic look and a thanks. I was a team leader too. FUCK YOU SUNRISE AND TOM FOSTER.'",

Guy I work with now is on probation for robing a circle k 😂'",
