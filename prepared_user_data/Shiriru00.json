And not on a hidden computer window too, they'd lean back in their chair and open wide the paper edition for all to see.'",
        "In response to '\"quiet quitting\" proceeds to work only 10 hours instead of the expected 15.', a user said: 'In the Japanese company where I worked you'd be lucky if the salarymen and OLs hit 3-4 productive hours a day. Which TBH is what I put in most days, but I have enough sense not to add 10 hours of facetime on top of that.'",
        "In response to 'This is a cycle you see in a lot of countries. One generation works hard in physical jobs like farming, then it shifts to factory work, and later to office jobs. As families build wealth, their kids often grow up with more comfort and less of the same drive to hustle. At the same time, companies face challenges like inflation and rising costs, and they struggle to keep productivity up. That’s when things like quiet quitting show up.\nThough to be fair, a lot of younger workers see it less as laziness and more as setting healthy boundaries after decades of corporate overwork. It’s a mix of economic shifts and changing attitudes toward work-life balance.', a user said: 'Putting in many hours of facetime is not \"work-life balance\". People can't/won't fight the corporate hive mentality so they quiet quit.\nThe mindset of Japanese companies is still the same. Just a few years back, a friend of mine with a 1yo daughter was told to be tanshin funin on the other side of the world. It's still fucked up.'"
