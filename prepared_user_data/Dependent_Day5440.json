        "In response to 'Been quiet quitting for 4 years now. Down to 1 office day a week and 3, 1hour meetings per week, rest of my days are quite empty without any real oversight.\nHonestly might need to start working a bit more, I’ve run out of shit to do, renovated pretty much the whole house, set up a little side hustle that no longer requires much input, run out of shit to watch  on the streaming services. Open to any ideas on how to fill the day haha', a user said: 'you can always learn new things or try new hobbies like cooking, baking, painting, sewing, if you feel like it.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: What happened with quiet quitting? I'm definitively going to start quiet quitting this next month. I'm not proud to work at my current company (quite the opposite) and my boss thinks he's paying to make me his slave.\nBut I was looking for tips on how to start quiet quitting here on Reddit and I could only find old posts. It seems like it's not a thing anymore. Is quiet quitting dead? What have I missed?', a user said: 'First, what tasks have you been doing that make you feel like you're being treated like a slave? I'm curious what’s the tipping point for you that made quiet quitting seem like the best option? To answer your question, it's not exactly dead, but it's not trending as much as before. It's more like people are rethinking the concept and realizing it's just about setting your boundaries and doing what's expected without overworking or going beyond. I've been there trust me but I just can't quit my job nor do less, what I did is find a tool that can help me with my tasks so I won't feel burned out.'"
