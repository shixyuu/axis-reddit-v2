        "In response to 'I made the mistake of car shopping this weekend. Lobbies were PACKED—- no shortage of customers willing to pay well over MSRP.\nI question our entire reality. Inflation is crazy— but people still seem to have money coming out of their ears.', a user said: 'Inflation is crazy\nInflation is mainly driven by corporate monopolies charging as they please. That’s the whole thing. Gas went stratospheric this summer. Was there a reason for gas to go stratospheric? No. Big oil just wanted to fleece its customers more. What do you see: they report obscene profits. Of course, because gas is extremely expensive, the consumer price index goes up. But that was not a given, it happens because corporations fleece their customers. There is a bit of market give and take what with the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, but Most of that is already priced in and they now have the warehousing capacity of the US almost stretched to the limit.\nIt’s not a shortage, it’s not a necessity, we’re just being robbed blind. Inflation and rate increases are just voodoo stories.'"
