Sometimes I'm willing to do more work, but you better bet I'll be compensated for it.', a user said: 'A lot of salaried work has \"reasonable overtime\" weaseled into contracts. Its complete be wording to get you to do more than they want to pay you for.\nI drive passenget trains and other than incidents where am unavoidably delayed inngetting to my sign off location on time. I DO NOT do any overtime at all. I don't even speak to my employer after I finish. I don't give a red f**k in hell if there is a crew shortage. That is a management failure and should be punished in turn. \nThe amount of missed calls from work numbers vs everyone else combined is almost equal.'",

They are actively choosing to ignore and undermine it.'",
