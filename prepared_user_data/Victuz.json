There's also taking 20 for situations where there's no time restraint and the player could theoretically just role until they get a 20.\nI fudged the rules for comedic purposes in the article.', a user said: 'PF is kinda wild for taking 10. An unchained rogue can get multiple talents that allow them to take 10 in ANY situation, including combat etc.\nI lazily built a lvl 11 npc to join a party (under their combat control) and I had to do a quadruple take when I found out she can basically always runs around with a 40 stealth result if just takes 10. While still doing pretty good combat damage. PF is something else'"
