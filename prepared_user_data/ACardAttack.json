He figures he doesn't have to make the best choices or do any more work than that contractual minimum.

        "In response to 'Yeah I hate the term “quiet quitting” but just started a new job and decided that I’m not doing anything outside of contract hours.

So freeing not to have to worry about anything.', a user said: 'Yeah, the term is god awful and makes me cringe everytime I see it'"
