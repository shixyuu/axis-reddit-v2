        "In response to 'Pro-tip for those joining the workforce:\nMany companies, especially the bigger ones, rarely promote you despite giving it 110%.\nThey rely on recruiting new graduates, who work overtime in the hope of promotion, only to burn-out or leave when they realise it's never coming.\nArguably you're better off simply doing your job, avoid being ill, then apply for a similar job at a rival company which no longer needs to train you.', a user said: 'Arguably you're better off simply doing your job, avoid being ill, then apply for a similar job at a rival company which no longer needs to train you.\nThis is the secret, and why so-called quiet quitting exists today. People used to work for the same company for 20-30 years and it made sense that you would get promoted if you excelled.\nNow a days most professionals will change jobs every 3-6 years, usually for a nice pay raise.  There's no longer any need to get to impress the bosses when those bosses are constantly changing.\nIf anything, my advice is when you first get to a new job bust your ass for 4-5 months. You'll make a good first impression and then you can coast by on minimum effort for 3-4 years while still having people think you are a super star.  By the time they get wise, you are going somewhere else with a hefty pay raise to do it again.'"
