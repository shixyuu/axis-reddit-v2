        "In response to 'Im in the UK and i did my own version of Quiet Quitting 30 years ago - i arrived at 9 and left at 5\nI had one colleague (Dean) who did the same job - arrived early and left late regularly but his figs showed he did about 20% less work (results wise) - he was very chummy with the boss and wasted a lot of time chatting\nSo at my appraisal my boss had a go about my attitude to houyrts and i repleid that i still got 20% more done - and he aaid \"Yes but imagine if you did the same hours as Dean - how much more youd do then\nSo i said \"So how much more would you pay me than Dean then?\" - and he sat silent\nI got up and said (I had balls in those days) - I think you need to reward your workers not your arse lickers - I handed my notice in a month or two later', a user said: 'So at my appraisal my boss had a go about my attitude to houyrts and i repleid that i still got 20% more done - and he aaid \"Yes but imagine if you did the same hours as Dean - how much more youd do then\nGot in trouble at my last job because I finished my primary caseload early. I pushed hard so I can make the express bus home.\nManager said there’s always more work. There are other work streams I can do but they’re secondary to the one I managed alone.\nGiven that I was too tired and with sore eyes to take care of the other stuff (which my colleagues manage primarily), I just thought fuck that.\nI will just work slower. That way, I only do my caseload and give myself less stress and eye strain in the process. My previous manager didn’t care when we left, as long as the work got done amongst all of us.'"
