        "In response to 'Not to OP, to everyone else. “Quiet quitting” as sometimes described as “acting your wage”, which is to say, working no harder than necessary, shouldn’t just be a milquetoast self protest for the lazy. Properly realized, this kind of withholding of labor is called “work to rule”, and it should be done as a concerted direct action with your fellow workers.\nThe world doesn’t just belong to the ruling class. It’s supposed to belong to us all.\nTalk to one another. Organize. Revolt. NG;NM.', a user said: 'yeah i don't think i've heard \"quiet quitting\" described as procrastinating, forgetting you lied about work you made up over the weekend, and being surprised you may not receive unemployment insurance. none of that sounds like intentional choice to combat exploitation of labor and entirely just happens to the incompetent regardless of their stance on capitalism.'"
