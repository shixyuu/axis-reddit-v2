Just hang in the hotel and watch TV, lie on the beach, sit in a cafe for 4h reading a book.\nIt's your holiday. The point is to do what you want to do, not what you\nshould\ndo.', a user said: 'Not just weekends, but full on vacations from traveling.\nThere have been times when I've just had enough, so I find a cheap hotel room with a tv and a good movie channel and I stay there for a week.  Watch a couple movies a day.  Go back to the same restaurants every day for meals.  Find a walk I like and do the same walk every day.\nJust a week of relaxation and monotony, with no tourist stuff.\nRe-charges my battery so I'm ready for some more adventures.'"
