Like they are all so anti school and haven't realized that life is work, honey.', a user said: 'I agree, but a lot of their parents when this generation was in the teen years, did NOT want their kids to work part time jobs after school, the way kids that parents Gen/ latchkey in the 70s/ 80s/ early 90s did. \nThat’s just one piece of the “these kids today and their work ethic..” pie.  Phones in school, helicopter parenting…none of that builds intrinsic motivation.'"
