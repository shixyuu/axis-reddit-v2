        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Me male HL wife LL Have you reached that stage ? Quiet quitting not leaving because of kids or what not but just quitting on the idea of romance in your head letting go of the resentment for your own mental health  and accepting that she’s just a roommate now ? We had yet another talk yesterday about it which she acknowledged the situation made promises again and that night it was just heavy snoring, told her today that I’m disappointed that our discussion led to no improvement even after her promises she said but we both agreed to make efforts ( because yeah I turned LL4U after all this time) I told her it’s ok I don’t even want to talk about it, I’m not even pissed as usual , she’s snoring as I’m typing this next to me and i don’t even care i don’t want her anymore and the sad part is the idea of getting to this point used to scare me but now I just don’t care, I don’t even think I love her anymore just that I’m used to her.', a user said: 'Yup. Eventually you just can't take the rejections and stop all attempts at intimacy. The DB slowly poisons the rest of your relationship and one day you discover your love for them has died, too.\nResentment comes crashing in like the Kool aid man, and you realize you don't even particularly LIKE your spouse anymore.\nI independently discovered grey rock, before learning the term. Highly recommend if you've given up.\nI stay for the kids, and because I'd have to live in an apartment with roommates instead of the dream house we have now.\nSo here I sit in my golden prison, with my co-parenting roommate.'"
