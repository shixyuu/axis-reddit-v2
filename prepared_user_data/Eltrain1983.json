        "In response to 'If I'm being paid what you consider the minimum amount for the work, I'm going to assume you're expecting the minimum amount of effort.\nWant more? Pay more.', a user said: 'This is what capitalism dictates. So much of the current economic climate in the US pushes capitalism as the best system, but the American economy has diverged so much the terms corporate capitalism and corporatocracy were coined to illustrate the differences.\nCapitalism dictates that workers, or any actors within the system, engage in the least amount of effort for the most gain.  Anything above ‘bare minimum’ is a donation to the business that reduces its ability to accurately determine its competitiveness within the market.\nIf your business needs its workers to donate extra time or effort for you to succeed, you are either a non-profit business (which is fine as long as you serve a social good) or a poorly run business and should fail.'"
