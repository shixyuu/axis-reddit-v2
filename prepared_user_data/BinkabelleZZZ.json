        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'I think alot of this is becuase of the hate,/she cannot win the audience over,espcially since covid,and Christine calling out the nanny situation.\nI think she is \"quiet quitting \"Kody too.She wants to free herself before he gets too old and she gets stuck \"haffing\"to take care of him.\nShe has been taking notes,and planning her financials I actually am not sure how far she would go,but we all saw how Kody cut down that tree,and the fact he works with fire arms is terrifying,just wonder if he ended up in a fatal accident,she would end up with alot more and sympathy too.\nIm just not sure how far she would go,I wouldnt put anything past her but i know she is no longer star struck,she is very much hated much to her surprise.This redemption attemption didnt help,so yeah,she really is giving us the minimum,just keeping the contract,the thing is she calls the shots with production too,by not sharing anything real.\nShe sounds so mumbly in some of her talking segments,like i wonder if her anxiety is so bad she is on a benzo,and maybe she had some clinical anxiety issue she uses to get easy edits.Yeah,I think she is starting to realize all dreams dont come true,and she cant wait to live out of the public eye.'"
