        "In response to 'Original Post: Hey guys, I was “quiet quitting” until I got fired , now what? So I just got fired and they recommended me to file for unemployment insurance. HR was surprisingly nice. She basically told me they don’t contest the claims, so I think if I use the right words in my unemployed application,\nI might be eligible for unemployment insurance.\nHas anyone successfully received unemployment insurance benefits in this situation before and lives in the state of Illinois? One of the questions is below:\nAccurately report your reason for separation from your job when you initially file your claim for benefits.\nEDIT: I  shouldn’t have used the term “quiet quitting” on my post because I used the term incorrectly, my apologies. I meant to say, I was really underperforming on my job, barely doing any work for the past year or so. I did the bare minimum. I was  then placed under an improvement plan for a little over 6 months or so. They saw some improvements, and I was doing okay, until I mislead my manager with 2 assignments. I stated that I had completed the assignment but in reality I used last year’s data to mark it completed, while I attempted to catch up over the weekend.\nI never fixed the assignments and my manager found out what I did. That’s when she went to HR for the next steps. I emailed HR for a written confirmation on why I was fired and she responded “unsatisfactory performance.”', a user said: 'Not to OP, to everyone else. “Quiet quitting” as sometimes described as “acting your wage”, which is to say, working no harder than necessary, shouldn’t just be a milquetoast self protest for the lazy. Properly realized, this kind of withholding of labor is called “work to rule”, and it should be done as a concerted direct action with your fellow workers.\nThe world doesn’t just belong to the ruling class. It’s supposed to belong to us all.\nTalk to one another. Organize. Revolt. NG;NM.'",
        "In response to 'I still don't get why it's a form of protest,it literally should be the default', a user said: 'If you’re working so little that you get fired, as OP did, I sure hope it’s some kind of protest. On the other hand, if you have a bunch of fellow workers start doing that with you, it’s a strategy to seize power at the work place by withholding productivity.'"
