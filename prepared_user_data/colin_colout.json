        "In response to 'Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think itâ€™s just us being lazy.\nMy parents didn't answer cell phones or emails after work hours.\nThen again, cell phone and emails didn't exist until the 90s, so work invading their private time wasn't a problem for them. Until the 90s rolled around.', a user said: 'You weren't expected to have a cell phone in the 90's.\nI started working in 2006, and even then it was rare to be always on call (at least not in the same way as now)\n* Plenty of people didn't have cell phones\n* You were charged PER TEXT MESSAGE and PER MINUTE on a call (even ones received)\n* Email was an expensive luxury that many phones didn't support (my flip phone supported it, but charged a monthly a subscription fee for the email app)'"
