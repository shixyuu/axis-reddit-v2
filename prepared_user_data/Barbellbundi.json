        "In response to 'I work as an automation engineer in USA for a medium sized business and we operate on 4x10s. I personally feel that we utilize all of the 10 hours during the day appropriately, with minimum wastage. I honestly don't think I could ever go back to a normal work week now.', a user said: 'I thought it would be hard but it isn’t, I’m doing 3x12 (6-6, mon-wed) and getting more jobs done now then I would in a standard week (frameless glass installation like pool fences, shower screens and balustrade) \nMy normal weekend is what most people consider a luxury only afforded maybe two or three times a year! \nLiterally every single thing in my life is bette! Relationships, health and fitness, happiness.\nTomorrow I’m going to go down the coast surfing for two days, visit a winery with a mate then come home and spend the “weekend” with my mum for her 60th, normally I’d just do a dinner with her  because I need to fit in down time in 2 days. \nIf my boss ever wants to go back he’ll be doing it with someone else, I’d take a three year $20,000 pay cut to kick off my own company in a heart beat if it means keeping my healthy work load'"
