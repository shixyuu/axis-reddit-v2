        "In response to 'how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nI would think: gradually and apologetically. Start answering select requests with, \"Gosh, I'm sorry, I'd love to help, but my plate is already full [or substitute the preferred jargon of your workplace].\" Do this more frequently as time passes.', a user said: 'I would suggest as well getting a couple of long-time advocates to assist you. Not in a direct way, but in an Outlook Calendar way. Have a 'collaboration session' that you only infrequently actually attend. So that time is blocked out on both of your calendars, but there is a mutual understanding that nothing occurs during that time. Or even just a 'check in' in the first two minutes and then the next hour does not need to be anything.'",
        "In response to 'I hate the word quiet quitting. Not going above and beyond for your work is not quiet quitting, it’s acting your wage and doing exactly what you’re paid to do.', a user said: '“Quiet quitting” is using the language of the capitalist oppressors. 45% of Japanese workers are rejecting wage theft and unpaid overtime.'",
        "In response to 'I think they are slowly, but it takes a lot of work and a need for the old gen to retire before changes really take hold. Same problem we are having here in the US.', a user said: 'You know, I’ve struggled at most of my jobs with the social aspect. There are always groups of coworkers going out to lunch together or walking the loop on break, and I just… don’t want to make small talk for 45 minutes in a setting where I need to watch out for over-sharing or anything like that  My work is social enough (meeting clients, leading meetings, etc) that I don’t want to share my down time with anyone. Then I feel like I’m perceived as distant or a loner or something (I am).'"
