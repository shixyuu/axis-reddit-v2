        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Maybe it was just today that was difficult to get a hold of any customer.\nI sent text after text to people and nothing.  Clicked to start the timer.  Nothing.  Phone call, straight to voicemail.  I left orders on benches outside buildings today.\nHad one, I go through all that and call the guy, he's sitting on a bench almost 30 feet away not even looking up from his phone.  He didn't even look up as he stood up to walk towards me and the vehicle.  He seemed entirely uninterested in receiving his order but was very upset two minutes later and called me demanding to know where the straw to his drink was.  You know, the one that was taped to his drink.\nPeople took theirs brains straight out their head and put them in the freezer to save them for Monday, swear to God, this was a TRYING TRYING DAY.'"
