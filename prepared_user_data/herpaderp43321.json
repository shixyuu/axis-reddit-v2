        "In response to 'Where I work, they grade you on 7-8 criteria on a 1-5 scale. If you get better than 3 on half or more, you automatically qualify for a ~5% raise. If you ever get 2 or more fives, you get put in the pool for management promotion. Needless to say, not a single person in our office of 20 has ever had more than two 4s on any review. No 5s. Why bother with the reviews if you’re just going to mandate that everyone gets an “average” score regardless of performance?', a user said: 'Its so they can quickly get hand picked new hires into management positions. Its there for nepotism not actual efficiency.'",
        "In response to 'Soft quitting and Quiet Quitting, or as I like to call them both: Doing your job as per the role in which you were hired and are paid.', a user said: 'This is why I keep saying we need to remove the \"duties as assigned\" as something they can put on jobs.'",
        "In response to 'Token?', a user said: 'Depending on how big the store is tokens are people you have to legally hire to maintain compliance, even if they suck at their job. Anti-discrimination laws and such.\nWhen applied correctly its great...when applied incorrectly it can cause massive inefficiency at work.\nNot sure OP is using the term correctly here though.\nJust an edit, ignore year replying to me at this point. They're going on about fox news and x-wings.'"
