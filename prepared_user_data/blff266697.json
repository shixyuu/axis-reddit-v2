        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Amazon There's a movement not really just Amazon but work in general since inflation is going so high, people are just giving up trying extra or doing more hard work than what's necessary. Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'What?\nI don't get any of your logic. Here's what I can tell you, though: you shouldn't be working your ass off as a T1 employee regardless of what you think inflation is.\nEvery day, you should be working your ass off to make sure that you are not only employable at places like Amazon. Doing T1 work.\nDo you want to move boxes for the rest of your life? No? Learn how to fix a car or a computer. Look into joining a union. Go to school.\nNone of my friends who developed job skills in their 20s are worried about inflation now.\nI'm telling you, you do not want to know how people look at you when you are in your 40s and say you work for Amazon.'"
