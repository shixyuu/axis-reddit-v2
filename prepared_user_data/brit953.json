        "In response to 'NTA. If your boss doesn't appreciate the extras, don't do them.\nI did the same at one of my jobs. Was harassed and bullied by two female coworkers. I put up with it, thinking I'd win them over by being  the \"nice\" coworker. In my last review the boss dinged me for not getting along with them, acknowledged they were bullying me, and said she'd fire me if I went to HR. So-no more bringing in cookies, no more contributing to or attending potlucks. When birthdays and potlucks came around, I'd cross my name off the list. Come in, go straight to my office, close the door. I even packed up my personal items and left the box next to my door. Other than staff meetings I didn't engage with anyone. Then I found a job elsewhere.', a user said: 'If someone threatens to fire you if you talk to HR, go straight to HR'"
