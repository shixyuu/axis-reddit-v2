We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: 'Maybe I’ve been quiet quitting for a while now. Ever since kids came on the scene I am out after I do my 40 and if I go over that I damned we’ll make sure I get that time back by cutting out early some other time or using that to go to an appointment.\n45-55 hours to succeed is not a work culture I would want to be in. It’s hard enough to be present in the lives of my kids as it is. You blink and they are grown already and to think I spent that time fawning over TPS reports or some bullshit “deadline” when at the end none of that mattered in the long run.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I feel that. I once asked for a raise based on my obvious workload compared to others and I was promised help offloading some of that and also to wait until next years budget. 6 months slid and not a damn change and that was enough for me to start looking and to ultimately leave. Words need actions or else they are just empty.'",
