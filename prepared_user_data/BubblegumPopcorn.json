        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'I really dont get how this is suddenly some new trend?...pretty sure a big chunk of people who are in work just do what is in their job description. I just think its a kinda shitty name; people who just do the \"bare minimum\" arent as good as quitting, theyre just doing their jobs.'"
