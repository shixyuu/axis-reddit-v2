        "In response to 'Don’t let the “almost beat”, “almost”, or “moral victory” talk start. As a Tennessee fan, I can tell you with 100% certainty that it’s not a good thing to embrace moral victories. Those are called losses.', a user said: 'I mean, nobody realistic thought we should be title contenders this season.  Of course we should be better than we are this year, but 2023 and 2024 are the window for us.  That's when it matters far more than this season.  I don't think it's a moral victory but there's no shame in being 2 yards short of beating Bama in Tuscaloosa.  If Jimbo was \"quiet quitting\" we would have lost the game by 50.  But we've got half the team out injured and we're playing almost 30 freshmen and sophomores on offense and defense and we did ok.  Not amazing, but this subreddit has their circlejerk.'"
