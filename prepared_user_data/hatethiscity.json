        "In response to 'I’d seek out honest feedback on why you didn’t get the manager role and do some self reflection. They probably didn’t interview you and think, they are amazing, but let’s pass them up and pull in somebody external because we love disgruntled employees. There has got to be some gap in you or your skills for their needs.\nThat said, put your time into finding the next thing and let this go because you won’t interview well with a big grudge on your shoulder.', a user said: 'A lot of this isn't relevant depending on the size of the company. I started my career at a 100k+ people sized company. I was entry level and after 2 years performing the same duties as people 5 pay grades above me. I told my boss I wanted a promotion and be said he'd try... didn't get promoted. The next year, I didn't get promoted either.\n6 years later and 4 job changes later I'm making 3.5x my starting salary in a lead engineer position. If I had stayed if be making maximum of 20-30% increase.\nMoving up in a corporation is very very difficult these days. You're competing against 100k other people who have been there longer than you and have deeper connections'"
