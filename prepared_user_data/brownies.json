        "In response to 'I have a remote job where I literally work maybe ten minutes an hour. It’s fucking glorious. I don’t live for weekends. I don’t dread going into work.\nThis has been the best job of my life and not because I am happy and fulfilled, but because there is zero stress.', a user said: 'Just curious, are you able to make the other fifty minutes actually worthwhile for yourself?\nFor a long time, I thought this kind of job was the dream. Now I've been there for about a year, and it's a soul-sucking nightmare. My days get destroyed because I'll have something like 1 morning meeting and 1 afternoon meeting, and I end up just idling away the hours in between. I usually just surf Reddit or watch Netflix. Best case, I'll get in a workout or read.\nI'm quitting soon to go to an actual job, where they're going to pay me more money to do real work. I don't know if it's just because it's been years since I had to do actual work for multiple days in a row, but I'm weirdly looking forward to it.'"
