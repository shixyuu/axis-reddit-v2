        "In response to 'Original Post: And they wonder why we quiet quit.... Worked at a this place for about a year, did a major systems overhaul with them where I was the front runner for work completed for the project, which helped us finish on our deadline, got praised and honored for my work, then I was told I'd get a nice raise, my raise was less than a fucking dollar in software development... I got a 2% raise when inflation is absolutely ravaging the country and prices have gone up much more than 2%.. works a fucking joke...', a user said: 'i don't know why it's called \"quiet quitting\"\nit's literally just doing the tasks expected of you.'",
        "In response to 'I don't know what's so hard for them to understand about that. It's true in every other case. If they want more widgets from their widget supplier, they have to pay the widget supplier more money.\nSimilarly, work is a transaction; you pay me a certain amount of money for a certain amount of work. If you want more work, you pay more money. Certainly they don't put extra money in my paycheck every so often just for the hell of it, so why should I give them \"bonus\" work for free?', a user said: 'Similarly, work is a transaction; you pay me a certain amount of money for a certain amount of work.
