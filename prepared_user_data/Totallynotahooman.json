After multiple awards without a pay increase that at least met inflation, I decided to only “meet expectations.”\nThen I quit to give myself a promotion.\nEdit: This was at Apple btw.', a user said: 'I didn’t even get any accolades when I worked there (phone tech support), just a vastly expanded scope of support with zero increase in pay.  The only way to secure that was to move the Level 2 Support which was significantly more stress (according to my colleagues who moved there). I’m surprised I lasted the three years that I did.'"
