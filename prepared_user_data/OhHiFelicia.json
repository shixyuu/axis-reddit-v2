        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'Apart from it being an absolutely ridiculous term and it just being a rebranding of an already used term, why would anyone do anything more than their job? Like it or not, your employer doesn't respect you, if you dropped dead they would replace you quicker than your family could arrange your funeral and you would be forgotten about. It baffles me that people have loyalty to companies that would replace them just to save themselves a few pounds.'"
