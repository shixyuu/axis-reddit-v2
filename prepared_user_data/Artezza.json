        "In response to 'https://www.npr.org/2021/05/17/997462169/thousands-of-people-are-dying-from-working-long-hours-a-new-who-study-finds\nMaybe they aren't quiet qutting but just health conscious.\nWorking long hours poses an occupational health risk that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, the World Health Organization says.\nPeople working 55 or more hours each week face an estimated 35% higher risk of a stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from heart disease, compared to people following the widely accepted standard of working 35 to 40 hours in a week, the WHO says in a study that was published Monday in the journal Environment International.', a user said: 'The article said people that used shrooms worked an average of 3.6 fewer minutes of overtime during the week. Minutes. Not hours. I don't think 3.6 minutes is enough to improve health. That's like the difference between clocking out at your desk and clocking out when you walk out the door'",
        "In response to 'Shrooms makes you realize that life ain’t about filling bankers’ pockets and you start to dedicate more time to self fulfillment', a user said: 'The article says the average difference was 3.6 minutes per week. It doesn't seem like it's a lot of people cutting 10+ hours out of their week because of some drug-induced epiphany. It's just as likely that it cleared their mind and helped them focus on work a little better, enough that in 40+ hours of work they can be efficient enough to save... 3.6 minutes. Or better yet the type of people who do shrooms are just ever so slightly less likely to want to work overtime based on purely correlative factors.'"
