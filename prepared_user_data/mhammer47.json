        "In response to 'One time I was running in Manhattan Beach and just happened to see a guy inside a beach house doing the elliptical looking at the ocean. He was kinda old, white, fat, and had a UCLA shirt. It clicked like 5 seconds later that it could have been Chip Kelly. On the way back I confirmed it was indeed Chip Kelly.\nThis was in the middle of the season on random Monday at 11 AM or so (I had a day off). I was wondering why he wasn’t working.\nI honestly don’t understand why he would leave that job, I can’t imagine willingly leaving Manhattan Beach for Columbus. He had the dream job.', a user said: 'It's funny about Manhattan Beach that people's living quarters in those massively expensive houses are really kinda on display for everyone to see. You're walking along the beach and you look to the side and you're looking at some rich dude chilling on his couch.\nI do understand his desire for a change though. It's a great lifestyle to be rich in Southern California, but\nresponsibilities\nand\npressure\nwill take a toll. Being the head man who everyone questions, everyone turns to for answers and who is ultimately held accountable for all outcomes, it's not for everyone and even for those who can handle it, it might not be something they can handle forever. It's a lot to deal with, and I can totally see how someone might want to take a step back from it, but still work in football.'"
