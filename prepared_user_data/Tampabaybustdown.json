        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Amazon There's a movement not really just Amazon but work in general since inflation is going so high, people are just giving up trying extra or doing more hard work than what's necessary. Just do the bare minimum and go home happy and healthy since work doesn't really care about workers really.', a user said: 'I started doing the bare minimum because my first month there I got a write up for marking an item missing that they ended up finding. I realized for every extra box I touch thatâ€™s one more risk of a write up for quality, one more risk of an injury etc. so yeah I do the bare minimum cause going above and beyond has no benefits but a lot of risk.'"
