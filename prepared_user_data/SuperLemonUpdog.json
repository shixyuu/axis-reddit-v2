I do wish it was on a day by day basis. That means I would have gotten overtime for all of the shifts I had to work late because the next person didn’t show up to the hotel on time for their shift.\nIf they\ngo over 40 hours during a work week\nthey will be paid overtime for any hours over 40 that they work. In actuality, what happens is they will send you home early as soon as they realize that you are about to hit 40 hours near the end of the week. That way you end up working an 8+ hour shift or two at the start of the week, and then a short shift later in the week so you stay under 40 hours. It’s absolute bullshit.'",
