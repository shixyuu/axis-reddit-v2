        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'My man I am 30 and already starting to feel the burn out of Sales.  Thinking of getting a specialised Masters degree in my field and getting out.\nLove closing deals, love the chase, but really starting to wonder if the perpetual stress is worth it.\nI've had a few major deals slip the last two quarters so I'm probably just salty.  But it's tough seeing friends take 2 week international vacations without a stress in the world while I feel bad even taking a Friday off.'",
        "In response to 'That sounds like a company issue. Many AE’s plan their schedule however they want', a user said: 'I have complete control over my schedule, but if I want to hit quota taking a long vacation puts my quarter at risk.'"
