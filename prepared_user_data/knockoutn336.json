How to make a better product isn't always obvious, but cutting costs generally is. One of the most ubiquitous ways of doing that is to get employees to do more work for the same pay.\nQuiet Quitting is a term invented to describe the current trend of employees, especially customer service and office employees, who oppose or reject that pressure to go more work for free.\nThe reason this has gotten attention in the last couple years is that the job market has shifted away from favoring employers to one that favors employees. Because of this, employees don't feel as much pressure to provide the free labor that and businesses have built their profits on. Many businesses aren't adapting to this well and have spent considerable effort to vilify it.', a user said: 'The goals you listed are ways to achieve the actual goal, which is to make the most profit. Making the best product is not a fundamental goal.'"
