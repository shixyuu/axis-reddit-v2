        "In response to 'I agree, things are weird right now. J1 CEO just raved to us last week about how profitable business is but in the next breath said we’re in a hiring and promotion freeze until 2024.', a user said: 'We’re in a hiring freeze as well and the CFO said they’re just “bracing for economic uncertainty.” Basically everyone keeps saying this recession will come eventually, so they’re just gonna sit tight until it does, despite having great numbers and sales are still up. And our parent company just wrapped up a record Q2, which beat the previous record which was Q1. Seems strange to me.'",
        "In response to '\"Quiet quitting\" is acting your wage. I am paid to do specific functions at work. Once I complete those functions, I have no incentive to do more than what I am paid to do. It's that simple.\nWhy should I do more? I'm constantly being shown that any company has no loyalty to their employees. Employees want better wages and working conditions, so they try to organize and form a union. The company retaliates and closes the location, effectively firing the employees without actually firing them - thus skirting union busting laws. Companies have seminars or webinars discussing how employees can do more for their employer, but never the other way around. Companies cut every corner they can to steal wages from their employees to instead line their own pockets.\nSo no. I'll do what I'm paid to do, and nothing more.', a user said: 'Imagine saying the plumber was “quiet quitting” because he didn’t stay extra hours to also remodel your bathroom for you. That’s really what it is and it’s all stupid.'"
