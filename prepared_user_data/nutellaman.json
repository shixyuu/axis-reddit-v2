        "In response to 'Just went through this a few months ago so I’ll share what I decided.\nI tried to decide between quitting and quiet quitting. I’m doing a hybrid.\nFirst, I’ve stopped doing all the ‘extra’ things I did before. Started directing everyone who came to me for help to “our new supervisor.”\nThen I started taking my lunch breaks again. Started leaving when the day was over. Stopped checking my email when I walked out the door. Started taking vacation and sick time. It was very freeing and made me less angry about not getting the job.\nI’ve provided help when asked but am certainly not going above and beyond. I’ve gotten praise for my handling of the situation, weirdly.\nI joked over the weekend that it feels very Office Space. The more I back off from my work, the more people think I’m succeeding.\nAnd I know the perfect job will come my way where my value is really seen. When it does, I’ll leave.\nThat’s my advice. Take some time to let the emotions die down and wait for the perfect gig. Strategize. Don’t rush.\nSorry you’re going through this. It’s extremely unpleasant. Keep your head up and remember that your coworkers are probably talking about what a mistake management made.\nEdit: clarity\nEdit 2: Clarity/spelling', a user said: 'I’m confused. How is taking your lunch quiet quitting?'"
