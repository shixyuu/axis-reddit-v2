        "In response to 'Wait. So doing what you were hired to do when you contracted to do it is now \"quitting\"?\nThe toxic work culture in the US basically implies that you\nwill\nwork unpaid overtime, that your personal time is still company time, that showing up on time is showing up late, and \"doing the bare minimum\" (read: what you were asked to do) is considered bad.\nSo if you're not being overworked and underpaid, then the job will basically harass you until you quit, or until you're fired. Which is why it's called \"quiet quitting.\"\nIn reality \"quiet quitting\" is a term to demean people doing what they were paid to do.', a user said: 'I think the thing people keep missing here is that it isn't the business \"forcing\" workers to over perform, it is that 10% of the workers have drunk the cool aid and work 24/7 like Dwight. That makes a 'normal' performance (like Stanely having the best sales record) look bad.'"
