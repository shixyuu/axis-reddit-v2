I also have left wing ideologies but it's hard to be taken seriously if you don't understand the terminologies and the broader context of the economy.', a user said: '“Capitalist (noun) - a person who uses money to invest in trade and industry for profit in accordance with the principles of capitalism.”\nIt’s a valid definition even within an economics forum, to differentiate from people who earn money through labour.'"
