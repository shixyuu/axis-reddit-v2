It's a culture of not being able to go home before your boss. Workers stay late until their boss\nfinally\nleaves, then they go out drinking with them. The workers that play this game get the promotions, the ones that don't get left behind. So, the new bosses continue the game. It's a farce.'",

It's a completely fucked up work culture and they would do well to abandon it. Farcical how they can't go home before the boss does, who stays super late, and then they all have to go out drinking together or they won't ever get promoted.'"
