        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'I think it started as a way to find another job by working the bare minimum to avoid being fired.  Then,  when another job was found, it was mutually beneficial for the employee to leave.\nNow it's become corporate propaganda.\nManagers want staff to go \"above and beyond\" for the possibility of reward.  They dangle the carrot at the end of the stick all year without ever telling you how long the string is.  And they have been showing performance results to their leaders for years with this behaviour.\nWorkers have seen what work-life balance can truly look like after working from home productively during covid.  The demands to go back into an office full-time does not make sense to those that have demonstrated they can do their job effectively without commuting daily.  And we have wised up to the carrot being a ploy to push us further and further each year with little reward.\nQuiet quitting is now a manglemanagement term used by managers that are being forced to hire the workers they actually need to get the job done.'"
