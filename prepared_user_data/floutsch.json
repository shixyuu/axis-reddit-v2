[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'I once was told \"You know, Floutsch, we men don't work for money, we work because we want to accomplish something.\" After a discussion about a raise. I'll leave it to your imagination if I got that raise. Also, the same person felt nothing wrong in discussing with me why he bought a second apartement to rent out so that his money would be safe from taxes (oversimplifying here, yes). I didn't even own the apartement I was living in.'"
