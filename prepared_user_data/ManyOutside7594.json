In contract law, they are. In reality, money talks.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'Gaslighting.  They're on a full court press to end WFH and literally purposely cause a recession for the sole purpose of leverage in further lowering wages and ending WFH.\nEvery day I see half a dozen\narticles\npropaganda pieces about how the revolution is over, get back  to work.\nI hope someone is keeping the receipts on all these\njournalists\nhacks so they can be held accountable.'"
