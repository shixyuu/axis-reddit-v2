        "In response to 'This is me at work. What happened is I got burnt out because too much was being asked of me with no support and shitty behavior was being directed at me but never addressed unless I pushed back and then it was to blame me for the issue. The stress and the misogyny and overall bad behavior have helped to deteriorate my health to a point where I’m getting concerned that I might die. But bills must be paid and a new job is hard to find. So would it be worse for my health to be unemployed and without health insurance or stay at a job that is harming me?', a user said: 'That was spooky… this was my experience at my last job. In nonprofit, of course, where they bleed you dry and tell you to accept poverty because leadership gives you candy once a year and the mission should warm your heart or whatever bullshit. My boss scheduled a meeting to yell at me and took my schedule away, questioned my sick time, and berated me and I rage quit because fuck her. They drive us to it. 🤷🏻‍♂️'"
