        "In response to 'LOL. I have a weekend gig and they hired a new manager. Why the dumbass kept saying we’re family in their first meeting baffled me. Like my dude, y’all ain’t got benefits, don’t pay overtime, no holiday pay and if I gotta call out, I gotta find someone to work that shift… yet, we’re family. Kept telling the dumbass to stop using the term because I ain’t their family(and I can barely stand my own family and I don’t even like working when this manager is on shift with me). They weren’t amused but I kept saying it every time they finished a sentence with “I want this to feel like family”. 😒😒', a user said: 'you want a family? then treat me like you care.'",
        "In response to 'Gawd I WISH I had 6 people left when they did this to me. It was a team of 8-10 and then it became a team of manager and me... then just me. Then day shift got MORE people and still somehow did LESS work so I was stuck doing overtime all the time every day. No pay increase though. However they DID take the time to tell me no more breaks allowed because of all of the shit to do.', a user said: 'sorry that would have been a case where I would have done EXACTLY what was in the contract and nothing more. remember you sanity is important.'",
        "In response to 'Most places it is still the responsibility of the employer to handle that.  The union just makes sure there are rules and they are followed.  For example my wife works for a telecom company as part of the CWA.  The CWA  negotiates the contracts and makes sure the interests of the employee are protected by making sure the company follow the specific rules everyone agreed to, the company is still responsible for write ups, counseling and retraining.   The problem is most of the managers, who are non-union, are as bad as the workers who happen to be poor performers and don’t want to deal with the steps to discipline them unless it is an immediately fireable offense that just requires them to submit the paperwork to HR.  They don’t want to take the time to do the actual steps required of them to deal with the situation.  End result you get poor performers and everyone blaming the union for “protecting them” when it really is just managers not wanting to do their jobs.  Meanwhile the managers who do their jobs never seem to have a problem with poor performers or the union.', a user said: 'yes.. because managers who know how to deal with trouble employees will do the write ups and paperwork so they can fire them with cause per the union rules and get someone in who will do the job. I feel for ya.'"
