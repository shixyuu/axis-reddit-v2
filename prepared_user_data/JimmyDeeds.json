        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'Recently stepped down from a BDM role to AM role and it was the best decision i have made, yes it was less money but it is much less stress and closer to home for me which means more time with my family, that time is quality time too because I'm actually present with them, not absent minded and stressing about things I'm trying to get across the line.\nStill get to build, foster, maintain relationships with my clients and help them wherever possible but that clock hits 5pm and i can switch off until tomorrow, its a very undervalued luxury that money cannot replace in my personal opinion.'"
