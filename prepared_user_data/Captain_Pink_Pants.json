        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'This is actually easier to do in your situation...  if you look occupied, people will assume you're occupied.  Pick and choose your spots to shine for a few hours or a day or two every now and then.  If done correctly, in a 2080 hour work year, you should be able to browse the internet for 2000 of those hours.'",
        "In response to 'Nice -  How would you choose your battles to shine? Any suggestions?', a user said: 'Yeah...  lots.  I've actually made an entire career out of this behavior, and am now nearly 50...  It's not that I don't love the work I do...  I'm just lazy...  but I'm also an adrenaline junkie.  I always loved working with computers, and have been addicted to the internet since the compuserv days.  I've been working in IT since I was 15.\nHit me with a dm...  I could write a book about how I've done it, but a lot of it might not apply to you or your line of work.  Drop me a line if you want to discuss.'"
