        "In response to 'The article says the average difference was 3.6 minutes per week. It doesn't seem like it's a lot of people cutting 10+ hours out of their week because of some drug-induced epiphany. It's just as likely that it cleared their mind and helped them focus on work a little better, enough that in 40+ hours of work they can be efficient enough to save... 3.6 minutes. Or better yet the type of people who do shrooms are just ever so slightly less likely to want to work overtime based on purely correlative factors.', a user said: 'Maybe this study is just to convince the less-savvy business owners to not let their workers do psilocybin in order to maintain an advantage. The *average* was 3.6 minutes less per week, but only a few \"lazier\" workers could drag this average down. I would definitely like to see the data plotted rather than simply averaged. Also, maybe these psilocybin users are simply clocking out more honestly instead of waiting for the hour to roll over, etc. It could be a sign of increased honesty as a result of a spiritual experience.'"
