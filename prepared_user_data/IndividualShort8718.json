        "In response to 'Just do what you agreed to. Simple as that. If they want more from you, they have to pay you more. Why would you work for free? And also why should you work your ass off at all? And for what? You just get more on your plate for the same pay. More work gets rewarded with more responsibilities and more work. Rarely you get more pay. Or the classic „alrighty, you work 55 hours instead of 39 now and get.. let me check.. 1.2 % more pay. Isn’t that great?!“ Yeah.. Fuck that noise', a user said: 'because im commission and my pay is directly related to my performance. because hitting my target is adding another 5 figures on to my monthly income. because I enjoy what i do and the customers i interact with. because i signed an agreement acknowledging that my scheduled hours often times wouldnt be enough given the work load. because I work my day off to finalise deals and make sure my on the clock time is used for new business instead of old. because I'd like to be a contributing member to society instead of flatbacking my way to a childtax cheque. because i want to be able to support my future goals and life style. because i enjoy the people i work with. because i said i would. because my word means something to me. because quiet quitting does nothing but hurt your leverage and causes unneeded stress in your life. because quiet quitting is really work-to-rule which does nothing outside of a unionized mass implementation. because if i work to rule im adding on to my co workers work load. because im considerate of others. because my customer base works wierd hours and sometimes ill reopen on sundays to accommodate them.\nbecause when i do these things and feel like my compensation plan no longer lines up with my earnings i know i can sit down with my dealer principle and renegotiate my rates.... which i did at the start of the week and effectively doubled my pay. <--- this only happened because i am an asset, within the same day of me voicing issue my boss was setting meetings with myself and my dealerprinciple to make sure im looked after. total resolution took less than 3 days for new pay plan to already be in effect.\nbecause when you find a company you like and a company that appreciates you its not hard to understand that business are here to make money and at the end of the day profit is important. that if my values align with the company values i know i will be looked after well and that if i have issue i do not have to worry about job security or pay.\nbut tell me who work-to-rule has impacted  you other than made you focus on what you dont like about your current situation. well you can fix that much quicker and will less impact to your coworkers by just fucking quitting and moving on with your life. your not the centre of the universe you never will be. suck it up and move on because non of the rest of us care after 5mins of reading your post but your coworks and friends sure as fuck will remember when you increased their work load because you wanted to be petty and drag your feet instead of either organizing in mass or just walking out...'",
        "In response to 'I'm asking out of ignorance here.\nIs quiet quitting acting your wage or doing the minimum possible? I don't seem to get the concept', a user said: 'its a woke way to say work to rule. its just old union strike mentality without actually forming a walkout. basically you work your job discription to a T and only your job discription.\nmy take away, if you unhappy enough that your going to create a hostile work environment for yourself why not do the proper thing for everyone and quit. your adding aggravation and stress to your life to \"try and prove a point\" to a guy that thinks of you by your employee number. move on with your life cause i can guarantee they dont know your name when you walk out.\nwork to rule or quiet quiting is a great tactic in unionized labour where you can do it in mass and show the short falls of the current job discriptions and how pay isnt equal to work being asked. at an individual level your just an ass hat creating axienty and stress in your co-workers and managers life, sure fuck the manager, or what ever this sub says. but why are you fucking your co-works as well? how is this helping your cause? im sorry but your an individual, a number, a monotone voice in a void of banshees, your not being heard and your only hurting yourself. quit if you want to quit, ask for a raise if you want a raise. BUT FUCKING USE YOUR FEET, and stop dragging your heels to make a decision.'"
