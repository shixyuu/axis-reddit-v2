        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Me male HL wife LL Have you reached that stage ? Quiet quitting not leaving because of kids or what not but just quitting on the idea of romance in your head letting go of the resentment for your own mental health  and accepting that she’s just a roommate now ? We had yet another talk yesterday about it which she acknowledged the situation made promises again and that night it was just heavy snoring, told her today that I’m disappointed that our discussion led to no improvement even after her promises she said but we both agreed to make efforts ( because yeah I turned LL4U after all this time) I told her it’s ok I don’t even want to talk about it, I’m not even pissed as usual , she’s snoring as I’m typing this next to me and i don’t even care i don’t want her anymore and the sad part is the idea of getting to this point used to scare me but now I just don’t care, I don’t even think I love her anymore just that I’m used to her.', a user said: 'I quiet quit in the sense that I’ve no longer asked for sex and don’t even bring it up. Brush it under the rug.'",

        "In response to 'You didn’t have sex for 6years what you still doing with him', a user said: 'Because there’s no divorce where I live, because it’s all not black and white like that.'"
