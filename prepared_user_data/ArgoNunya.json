        "In response to 'What they're saying is true though, usually. It doesn't mean they're working harder than the people on the bottom, but they are going to now be expected to do more or work more overtime, etc. than they were doing before.\nI've been complaining about all the expected overtime every week at my current job for about 2 years straight. They gave me a raise (that I didn't ask for) at the end of last year. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate getting paid more, but my real issue was with the overtime, which they haven't tried to reduce at all. If anything it's become worse.\nWhat we really need is another employee so we are not so overworked all the time but it's cheaper for the company to pay my team a little bit more and overwork us instead.\nI'm not struggling financially which is great, but I also get off work late and am too tired to do anything, even on my days off which fly by so fast.', a user said: 'I just landed a high paying job after my PhD. Not that I didn't work hard in grad school, but life was flexible. I could go on vacation without asking anyone and be spontaneous. Now I'm making several times more than in grad school but have less vacation and have to ask a manager for time off. I really don't need this much money, what I need is time. If I could find a job with half the time commitment and half the pay, I'd take it in a heartbeat.'"
