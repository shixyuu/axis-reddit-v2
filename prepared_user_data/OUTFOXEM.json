        "In response to 'I spent years of my career as a software tech supervising teams of engineers making literally double my salary. When I finally graduated they somehow couldn't find the budget to pay me within even 10k of the people I was tasking.\nI'm at a different company now and making triple what I was then but honestly I'm doing maybe a quarter of the work, intentionally. Maybe it's quiet quitting or maybe I just got the lesson early in my career that hard work doesn't get you fuck all. I've gone from working 60 hours a week to maybe 10. I'm never going to be that sucker again.\nI was raised by blue collar parents who taught me that hard work was the key to success. Nope. Not even close. It's all bullshit\nHonestly, if I weren't a government subcontractor I'd probably try to dip my toe into the\nr/overemployed\nworld and see how many different positions I could half ass at once', a user said: 'I was raised by blue collar parents who taught me that hard work was the key to success. Nope. Not even close. It's all bullshit\nCan't upvote this enough. There was a time in America where this actually was the case. That was maybe 50/60/70 years ago. It is no longer the case. Hard work (aka extra work) does not get you anywhere anymore.  The only exception is if you’re working for yourself. As long as you’re working for someone else then it is not the case.  If you're getting OT for doing more, and you're happy with that arrangement, then by all means continue. Don't do it for free though. Never do it for free.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'send your resume around\nIt's not the 1950's. Loyalty to a business is not a thing and shouldn't be a thing. These corporations will cut you faster than you can blink an eye, and not think twice about it. Nobody should have any loyalty to any business because they will not help you when you need it.\nSend your resume around. Constantly. Never stop. Follow the money. Why? Because that's what they do.'",
        "In response to 'I got given a raise at work and my first thought wasn't 'oh cool a few more bucks an hour' it was 'oh fuck i'm going to have to do more work/work harder'', a user said: 'If only that was true. The hardest workers are always the people on the bottom.'",
        "In response to 'What they're saying is true though, usually. It doesn't mean they're working harder than the people on the bottom, but they are going to now be expected to do more or work more overtime, etc. than they were doing before.\nI've been complaining about all the expected overtime every week at my current job for about 2 years straight. They gave me a raise (that I didn't ask for) at the end of last year. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate getting paid more, but my real issue was with the overtime, which they haven't tried to reduce at all. If anything it's become worse.\nWhat we really need is another employee so we are not so overworked all the time but it's cheaper for the company to pay my team a little bit more and overwork us instead.\nI'm not struggling financially which is great, but I also get off work late and am too tired to do anything, even on my days off which fly by so fast.', a user said: 'I definitely hear what you're saying, but based on my personal travels through the corporate world (Forbes 5-10 companies), the higher up you go the less hard they need to work -- or even just straight up work less overall.\nI also think it depends how high up the corporate ladder you look. The company I'm at (for now) has something like 12 levels between the frontline employee and the CEO. Depending on the size of the company, if you're only 1 or 2 levels above the frontline employees then you're still too low where that extra work is expected, and a \"promotion\" might actually mean a pay cut when you look at hours worked. I have passed on so many promotions for this very reason. It was more money earned, yes, but I would actually earn\nless\nper hour worked. I was better off staying at my current position and just working OT if I could.'"
