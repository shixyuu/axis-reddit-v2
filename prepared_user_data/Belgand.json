        "In response to 'Very few cases go to trial because the overwhelming majority of criminal defendants plead guilty, not because prosecutors drop charges', a user said: 'Even beyond that, conviction rates are terrible. I remember one chapter in\nHomicide: A Year on the Killing Streets\nwhere David Simon goes over the statistics for one year of homicides in Baltimore: how many were reported, how many had an arrest made, plea bargain, went to trial, and convictions. It was an incredibly small number that went through the entire process. Definitely in the single digits. Plea bargains weren't much better. By far the vast majority of murders didn't result in any kind of sentence.\nAnd that was for murders. One of the few crimes that the police generally take seriously enough to actually put some effort into investigating.'"
