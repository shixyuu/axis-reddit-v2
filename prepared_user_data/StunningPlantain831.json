        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'I occasionally fantasize about quiet quitting domestic chores. Throwing dirty towels and clothes accumulated on the floor outside on the porch. Throwing out all the paper towels so someone else would have to fucking order it when it runs out. Pissing all over the toilet seat so someone else can sit on MY piss for once.\nBut alas.'"
