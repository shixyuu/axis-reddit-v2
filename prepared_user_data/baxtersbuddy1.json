They would have to hire 3 people to do your job, and so they couldn't offer the promotion to you.\"\nActually said by my boss when I tried to move up in a company off the entry level.  I was 19 at the time and it shattered me to know that my hard work was actually holding me back.', a user said: 'My boss has made similar comments about some of our entry level employees. “Should we promote them when they are so good where they are at?”\nI have to constantly remind her that when people realize that the only way to move up is to move out, they quit and move out to try other opportunities.
