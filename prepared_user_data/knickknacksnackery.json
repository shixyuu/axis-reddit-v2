        "In response to 'Are you actually a teacher? Don’t you see how irrational it is to characterize an\nentire\ngeneration, tens of millions of people, as “lazy slackers” or “whiny hippies”? These characterizations aren’t based in anything tangible, just vague feelings and emotional reactions to things that are different.\nWhy did you start with the silent generation? Is it possible that the greatest generation had negative opinions of the silent generation? What about the generation before that?', a user said: 'Are\nyou\nactually a teacher? Every single teacher I've talked to who's been teaching for ~10 years or more has articulated a\ntangible\ndifference in the work ethic, self esteem, and attitude of today's students compared to students less than even 10 years ago.\nThere is something deeply worrying going on in this generation, different than the generalized complaints about \"lazy slackers/whiny hippies.\" I am legitimately seeing a generation of students that will be woefully unprepared for adulthood, and that is not for lack of trying on the teachers' parts. There will be exceptions to this of course, but you can't use that to discount the fact that\nmany\nworrying things are happening.\nAnd this isn't some old codger yelling at a cloud here - the things I'm seeing are worrying even to me as someone fresh out of college, barely 10 years older than the middle schoolers I teach.'"
