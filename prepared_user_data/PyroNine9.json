        "In response to 'Jesus Christ, weâ€™re not doing cable again goddamn it!', a user said: 'We're already doing cable again. At one time the big problem was cable companies bundling the one chanel you wanted with 23 junk channels (and usually 2 or 3 yet another shopping channels) and charging for all 23 rather than offering alacarte.\nThen streaming services came about offering everything for less than the cable company charged and without commercials.\nNow we have an ever growing number of streaming services offering an ever shrinking catalog of shows (as a bundle). And commercials have gotten back in as well though (for now) you can pay extra to avoid them.\nSo the big change is that now instead of adding package XYZ for that one channel you want it's adding streaming service XYZ for that one show you want.'"
