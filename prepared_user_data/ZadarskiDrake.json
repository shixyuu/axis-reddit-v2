From Great Resignation to Quiet Quitting [External Link]: https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2023/09/27/where-are-the-workers-from-great-resignation-to-quiet-quitting', a user said: 'The amount of cars I see on the roads at random hours during the week like 9 am-1pm is insane. So much traffic  you’re telling me all these people are third shift workers, restaurant workers ? I don’t buy it lol. It just blows my mind how there’s bumper to bumper traffic on a Tuesday at 10:30 am. Maybe these are all work from home people going to the park to do their work lol'"
