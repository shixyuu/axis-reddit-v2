        "In response to 'The DA prosecutes the Palestinian protestors because they were actually arrested or cited by the police.  Because that was easy.  They didn't flee on motorcycles.\nThe DA cannot prosecute the dirt bike dudes because they haven't been cited and arrested.  I theorize its because its harder than rounding up a few compliant protestors.  I'm honestly not convinced that chasing these dudes is actually the best idea or even effective.  What would be is monitoring social media and going after the people behind it.  There is almost no attempts to hide identities at all here, you don't need to be the NSA to id them.  But thats more work than just showing up and having mostly compliant protestors who are easy to cite or arrest because they do not flee.', a user said: 'Good points'"
