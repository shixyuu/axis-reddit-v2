        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I do this. I'm in the last year of my apprenticeship. Usually the boss is supposed to educate me and to learn new things. But he doesn't, he just uses us as cheap employees. I talked to him about this, I told him I WANT to learn and that the time here is very frustating for me. It changed for maybe a month and now I'm back to very stupid tasks and often I even have to ask multiple times for more work. I either have nothing to do or things that had to be done yesterday, because he forgets his mails. My adhd has gotten so much worse since I work here. Because of this I give my bare minimum. I still try to do good work, but I'm not ready to invest more energy than necessary. I do what I have to do, but not a single thing more. Point five when my day ends, I go home.'"
