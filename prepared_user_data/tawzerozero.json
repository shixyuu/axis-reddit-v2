        "In response to 'Please don't take this as a criticism since you've already had your epiphany!\nI've always viewed the guy who never calls out as someone who's either bad at time management or has no hobbies. Not judgmentally, but kind of in an empathetic way. Like, you can't think of anything at all you'd like to get paid to do on your day off? It's PAID!! I love the feeling of waking up on my paid day off and just telling myself I'm getting paid for everything I do.\nWatching star wars in my underwear? Paid. Eating waffles? Paid. Poop in my own toilet? Paid paid paid. I carry absolutely ZERO vacation time and it disturbs the hell out of my coworkers and bosses. I don't care, I'm happy getting paid to do shit other than work. There are so many different ways to get a day, a week, a month+ off in an emergency. USE YOUR TIME OFF PEOPLE. LIVE.', a user said: 'Having zero friends is my reason for never taking PTO.  At least if I work, there are people I can talk to.\nThat said, I never let any PTO expire since it is part of my pay, I just let it accrue, then take it when it would otherwise expire.'"
