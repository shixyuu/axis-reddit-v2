        "In response to 'You might be right, but this is the most \"Imma-get-mine\" crowd I know.\nAnd more power to 'em. Companies been gettin' theirs for years.', a user said: 'Can you blame us? The world as a whole has recently voted in right wing grifters nearly across the board in the past couple years. If your fellow citizens are too stupid or selfish to raise all ships, then what's the point in trying to help it rose yourself?'",
        "In response to 'Regardless, if you take a job, OE or not itâ€™s an agreement for a time trade. Donâ€™t be a piece of shit and honor your end of the agreement you make.', a user said: 'I'm doing well with my jobs. Not by doing a \"time trade,\" but by doing a product trade; I give them the end product they want and I get paid in return. It works phenomenally well and happens to be how companies and the wealthy work as well. So strange that they want the poors to operate on different principles from them, isn't it?'",
        "In response to 'WTF does politics have to do with it? The post is about the inconsideration of other fellow OE'ers at the company. Do the bare minimum then. Not just ruin for the rest of his colleagues.', a user said: 'The point is that when a society is inconsiderate, the individuals within it are going to be more inclined to be inconsiderate. The behavior of those in charge, especially when so public about it\ndoes\ninfluence the behavior of the impacted citizens.\nSee: Russian corruption extending deep into every facet of society because it's normalized at the top.'",
        "In response to '', a user said: 'The conclusion that people running the government and actively influencing the media have impacts on society? Yep, totally crazy thoughts ðŸ¤¡'",
        "In response to 'This too happened under Biden. Stop being a clown. You just want to farm karma on here. We're not idiots. That dopamine hit you got with all those angry anti Trump comments and upvotes got you hooked!', a user said: 'It's always interesting how devoid of intelligence or critical thought magats are. If you're really shocked by the statement that a country's citizen's behavior is influenced by the country's culture or that a country's culture is influenced by those who are most present and influential in it, then there's really no helping you.'"
