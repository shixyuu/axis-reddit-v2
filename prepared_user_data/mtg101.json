        "In response to 'Do exactly what you have to do for the job, but there’s no reason to do it badly. That doesn’t tend to help you either.', a user said: 'Here we go with the language again. You're turning people doing what they're paid for into \"quiet quitting and \"doing it badly\".\nPlus even accepting your language, doing things badly is far better than doing things well for the individual. Doing things well just means you'll get more work without more pay.\nAct your wage.'"
