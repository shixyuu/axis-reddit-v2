        "In response to 'Original Post: what's up with quiet quitting? I've heard this term \"quiet quitting\" over the last year, indicating that people doing their jobs are somehow not doing enough. If the minimum requirement isn't enough, shouldn't the minimum be reset?  I feel like I'm misunderstanding the meaning of this term.\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/what-is-quiet-quitting-6743910', a user said: 'Answer: to add to already great answers there is another aspect of \"quiet quitting\". Employers now are crying because they used to dump more responsibilities (quite often way more than the employee contract specifies) on their workers and workers had to oblige due to fear of losing the job or being passed on the promotion if they don't.\nNow the workers fight this back by saying \"not my job\" and refuse to accept additional work without compensation. Which is fair enough, but employers are now crapping their pants because employees are not afraid of being fired if they don't take more work on their shoulders. Workers have long realized that going above and beyond does not give a single benefit. No raise, no bonus, no appreciation. So why would they \"exceed expectations\" if there is literally no reward for it? Employers are always happy when someone is doing more than they are paid for, because that's means they get more from an employee than they are paying for. It surely helps that the job market is now favouring the workers, so if a worker feels they are not appreciated or are being threatened with firing they can just quit and change job or workplace.\nIn short, the\ncake\ncarrot is a lie and the stick is broken.\nSo the employers came up with this utter nonsense called \"quiet quitting\" to basically complain that the workers are not giving the job more than they are paid for. It's propaganda to make workers feel bad for refusing to be abused.'"
