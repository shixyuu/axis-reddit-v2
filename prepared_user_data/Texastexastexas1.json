        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Update: wow, the support!  Thank you all!\nWill now only refer to this as \"Just doing my job\"\nStarting today, I quit working for free.  I won't manage the school food pantry, sew for students or school programs ( uniform alterations, letter jackets, CTE jackets, prom dresses), work the gate or track meets, cover hall duty for others, support fundraisers, sponsor or coach teams, provide snacks to students, participate in staff potluck meals.\n I will arrive 2 minutes before my designated duty time and leave 2 minutes after hours.\nI will take off every Friday to help my family, and take off every PD because I have yet to attend a worthwhile PD (I have only been teaching since 2001, a valuable PD is unlikely to occur in the next year).\nI have 80+ days of leave accrued, and I will leave as few on the table as possible. \nThere is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.', a user said: 'At our school, we get off at 3:15.\nParking lot is vacant at 3:30.\nPrincipal tells us to GO to our family.'",
        "In response to 'I like your principal', a user said: 'I am honestly happy every morning.\nThis principal is insanely supportive.\nShe wants plans posted by the door but has never read mine. She said she only cares about what’s going on in the classroom.\nTeachers routinely quit my previous district solely because the lesson plan requirements were time wasters and complete bs. It took all the fun out of planning. Now I spend 10 min and done.\nJust write the concepts — rhymes, syllables, US flag, state flag, family unit, etc and spend my prep time actually prepping. It is 100x less stressful.\nShe sits on a bench by the office and greets every kid and teacher every day. \nBig smile.\nUnlimited paper/ lamination/color copies, staff meet 1x month and I swear she spends 5 min telling us how great we are and how lucky she is to be our P.\nTeam meetings only bi-weekly.\nI applied on a whim at the end of the summer and she hired me on the spot. \nShe puts the fun back into teaching. After what I went through in Texas….I am greatful.'",
        "In response to 'Agreed 100%. I work my contract. If if doesn't get done, ok. If someone says something about it I'll do it. But I'm not working 80 weeks. I do not get paid for 80 hour weeks. (Which is what the job would take, I know plenty of teachers who do it.)', a user said: 'Public education was built on the backs of women willing to work for free.'"
