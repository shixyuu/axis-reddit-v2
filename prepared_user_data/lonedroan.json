If you want that agreement to change then communicate that, (we pay decently fwiw) but don’t just stop working.\nThat’s the same as them making you work and not paying you. Unless the company is abusing that agreement, you both should honor it IMHO.', a user said: 'You usually also agree to not work a second full time job. Why the inconsistent treatment in what’s agreed to (I’m not anti OE)?'",

No more or less', a user said: 'I was using “you” generally. One often agrees not to work a second job, and a don’t see the OE community tut-tutting them. Again, I don’t think they should he scored, but it’s bizarre that you’re hiding behind the type of agreement that many OE set ups violate.\nAlso, what certain level of results?
