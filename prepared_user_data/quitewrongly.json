        "In response to 'I feel like MLK Jr's quote about the white moderate is very prescient about the DNC and most liberals today:\n\"...but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\"\nBit of a long copy/paste chunk from his letter from Birmingham jail but every line feels like it still applies today. People like Favs feel way more focused on order and the process than justice.', a user said: 'Yeah but the way Favs and the boys are treating any kind of civil disobedience, you'd think MLK Jr wrote \"Letter To The Editor, Birmingham Times-Picayune\", which single handedly brought civil rights to everyone, amen.'"
