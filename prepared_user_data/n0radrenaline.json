        "In response to 'Reading your post suddenly brought me back to why I quit working for a corporate franchise and started working at a privately owned small business. You are absolutely correct with your description: It was GREAT, at first. By the time I walked out, I had been so beaten down, I didn't even realize it was making me miserable until after I left.', a user said: 'I worked for a privately owned small business. The culture was great although the past was a little on the low side and the owner was a bit of a loose cannon. I was happy to go to work every day.\nEventually the owner decided he'd rather play golf and ski all day, so he sold the company to a big corporate overlord, so I ended up in corporate hell despite my best efforts.\nThey did double my salary over the course of three years (with a little prodding on my part), so there's that I guess.'"
