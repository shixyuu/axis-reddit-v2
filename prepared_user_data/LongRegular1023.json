        "In response to 'Original Post: CMV: \"Quiet quitting\" is not only hypocritical & nonsensical, but the very existence of the term marks a deplorably unequal economy. Recently, many major corporations have started to use the term \"quiet quitting\" to refer to employees whose productivity remains consistent, implying that not continuously increasing one's output at work is akin to stealthily quitting one's job. This is, to anyone who wasn't born into the top 0.5% and then went on to become a CEO who never worked a job below $60/hr in their life, a ridiculous idea. The entire point of working a job under a capitalist system is that you are exchanging your labor for a contractually agreed upon wage. While the tenets of capitalism fundamentally require that you be paid less than your work is worth to the company, this CMV doesn't aim to touch on the fundamental inequalities of capitalism, but rather the bastardization of the capitalist system that Westerners in 2023 are forced to face.\nWhen a laborer agrees to work for an employer for a wage, the principles of ideal capitalism dictate that the agreement between the laborer and employer is mutually beneficial: the laborer is happy performing the required labor in exchange for the offered compensation, and the employer is happy reaping the profits of said labor in exchange for paying said compensation.\nEvery single nation employing this style of capitalism also uses fiat currency: currency which is inherently inflationary and will always reduce in value (at varying rates, but always tending towards a reduction in currency value through inflation). In the US, the proprietor of the global reserve currency and the most influential capitalist republic in a world brimming with capitalist republics, the rate of inflation has significantly exceeded the rate of wage increase for over a year now; that's not including the even further blown-out cost-of-living skyrocket nor the record-breaking strides in the efficiency of labor thanks to technology.\nIt has been shown time and time again that, while the economic stagnation brought on by the pandemic surely did inhibit the global economy, more than half of the increase in both inflation and cost-of-living in advanced Western economies has been solely due to greed-driven exploitation of global unrest by corporations who have posted record profits despite devastating drops in demand through pure price gouging and exploitation.\nThe use of the term \"quiet quitting\" betrays the not-so-secret key to maintaining profitability for shareholders despite negative economic trends: employers have always expected workers to sacrifice whatever necessary in their own lives for the increased profits of their already exorbitantly wealthy shareholders. For the past few decades of increased productivity and prosperity, this has been fueled by laborers' belief that hard work and blind dedication will result in financial advantages: work hard, provide more value to your company, and you get paid more: capitalism at work. Except now, we live in a world where even the most generous of incentivized bonuses still amount to a reduction in wages according to purchasing power.\nIf your wage is not actively adjusted for inflation, you are taking on a recurrent decrease in salary.\nTL;DR a laborer under a functioning capitalist society exchanges an agreed-upon quantity of labor for an agreed-upon wage. The economy under which most of the Western world currently exists has become vastly preferential of business owners and corporate elite through pure corruption, and the idea of \"quiet quitting\" is just a small yet potent example of how the wealthy have been actively and increasingly exploiting the working class for decades, inevitably trending towards record-breaking profits for the top 1% regardless of wider economic factors, and a consistent degradation of the wage, purchasing power, and political representation of the workers actually creating value.\nPlease change my view because, as a highly politically and economically educated person who was born into a problematically socialist society and raised in another, now living in the US, I desperately want to be able to support the widespread prosperity afforded under a capitalist system, but the US has already easily passed the threshold from capitalism to oligarchy.\nAs an immigrant US resident who believes in this country but can't vote, I desperately remind Americans that you're allowed to vote for someone who isn't a corrupt geriatric billionaire - please just stop watching CNN, FOX, and MSNBC, and maybe actually read a campaign platform or two. You have competent politicians, you just refuse to give them power for some reason...', a user said: 'The problem with your view is that while capitalism is not always equal and fair, it's far superior to the other systems. Capitalism isn't perfect and it's never claimed to be, but history has shown the power of capitalism and how it has transformed society for the better.\nCapitalism provides a platform of unlimited possibilities. Indeed, the worker who goes above and beyond may not get the promotion and respect at their organization, but they have the freedom to pursue other opportunities such as switching to a new job, career path, or starting their own business. Look at the history of some of the big US companies and you will find many case studies.\nContrast this to communism for example, where the economic mobility and opportunity simply aren't there. If you think capitalism is corrupt and doesn't provide the necessary payoff for hard work, I think you will be shocked to understand the economic prospects of those who labored within Soviet Russia.\nAt the end of the day though, it's all about mindset. Those who have the drive and passion to succeed will ultimately end up succeeding in the long run. Those who simply sit back, do the bare minimum, and constantly complain about the flaws in the system will find their prospects diminished.'",
        "In response to 'Capitalism provides a platform of unlimited possibilities. Indeed, the worker who goes above and beyond may not get the promotion and respect at their organization, but they have the freedom to pursue other opportunities such as switching to a new job, career path, or starting their own business\nI strongly oppose your use of the word 'freedom'. Even within the narrow parameters that you placed on the word, freedom is not the right word. I simply cannot abide one more capitalism apologist deploying the word freedom in the same conversation as this economy. We are indentured servants. I might go so far as to say we are slaves, even at the risk of being hyperbolic. The 'choices' that we all have are so constrained so as to evaporate entirely.\nâ€‹\nThose who simply sit back, do the bare minimum, and constantly complain about the flaws in the system will find their prospects diminished\nNow we're lazy, too? The Americans that I know work like animals and still cannot afford to pay the bills, and I'm talking about housing, food, and other basic needs, not Gucci bags and Hawaiian vacations. You may believe the things you are saying here, but I would like nothing more than to disabuse you of these ideas. The top 1% of earners are capturing 90% of the wealth and then shaming me while they do it, so pardon me, but I shall reserve my 1st Amendment right to \"constantly complain\" whenever I see catastrophic wealth disparity mixed with a propaganda campaign extolling the invalid virtues of meritocracy.\nWe must\nall agree\nthat hard work and positive attitudes are not going to thwart the status quo. We don't need to grin and bear it and pretend that things will get better on their own. Instead, we need to unite and collectivize and liberate all of the wealth that has been stolen from us.', a user said: 'I might go so far as to say we are slaves, even at the risk of being hyperbolic. The 'choices' that we all have are so constrained so as to evaporate entirely.\nIf you think the choices available in a capitalistic system are constraining, you will be shocked to see what's available via other methods. However, the fact remains that there isn't a system where folks have the option to not produce while still reaping consumption benefits. You are looking for a fantasy world that does not exist. It's disgraceful for you to even mention the word slavery in this debate and shows that you have a complete lack of understanding of what the millions of true slaves throughout history had to endure.\nNow we're lazy, too?\nOf course I didn't say lazy, but clearly, your mind has been warped by your absurd beliefs. No one forced your hard-working friends to take the jobs they have, and they should evalute their circumstances and choices they've made throughout their life that led them there. Next, consider this: you are a manager with 2 employees under you who are essentially work equals, and you have the choice to promote one of them. Employee A shows up on time, does the minimum, and consistently achieves the production goal. Employee B shows up an hour early, goes above and beyond, and consistently surpasses the production goal. No effective manager is promoting Employee A over Employee B.\nI shall reserve my 1st Amendment right to \"constantly complain\" whenever I see catastrophic wealth disparity mixed with a propaganda campaign extolling the invalid virtues of meritocracy.\nIndeed, it is your right to constantly complain as you see fit, and no one is arguing against that. However, while you are busy complaining, the next Bezos, Gates, Musk, and that self-made millionaire down the street will be working and pushing themselves to achieve something greater. Again, I'm not saying capitalism doesn't have flaws, but the system has proven itself and is a big reason why even the poorest among us have a higher standard of living compared to the vast majority of people who have ever lived on this earth.\nInstead, we need to unite and collectivize and liberate all of the wealth that has been stolen from us.\nFinally,  let's wrap this up by thinking about this gem of a comment. How do you expect to liberate stolen wealth when you and everyone else gave it up willingly in the first place? You wanted to consume, and there is a price for that. There's no such thing as a free lunch.'"
