Violence is pretty fucking hard to control once you commit to it.\nNobody gets violent until it gets past the point where it would have been less costly because the cause is personally too fucking high.\nHaving it organized is barely better than a popular uprising. For every Maidan there's a hundred Arab Springs.\nIf you're just interested in keyboard posturing though you can act like they've already taken away elections and dissolved the judiciary. Don't get me wrong, if you're in the USA it's close but definitely not there yet.\nIf you're in a non-US nation, get real bud.\nOr you can pull a Marios Brother yourself if you really, really, really believe that we're at that point but you're most likely hoping other people will pay the cost for your ideals rn.', a user said: 'Not being able to afford food, rent, healthcare, and education is violence. People rebelling for want of those are simply hitting back'"
