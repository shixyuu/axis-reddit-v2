        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'I don’t really even understand this phrase because I don’t think it has anything to do with actually quitting. The most stressful and demanding job I’ve had (I’m only 27) was one where I was being paid 19k a year, and I was constantly taking on new responsibilities and pushing myself because I wanted a promotion that never happened and the goalposts for which were constantly moving. I asked my manager if I could have a pay review because I knew I was being paid a lot less than other people in my department while doing a lot more. I was basically laughed at and this was for a very big and very well known company in the UK. Now I’m earning more than twice that wage and I am very much an advocate of only doing what you’re paid to do. I’m ambitious so obviously I will do the best I can and push for opportunities of growth, but only within my professional boundaries and where it actually suits me. The biggest thing I’ve learnt in my comparatively short career so far is to always put yourself first!'"
