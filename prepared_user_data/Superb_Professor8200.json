        "In response to 'I tried to quiet quit in a similar situation.\nAfter a single day they rode my ass so hard that I knew it would be impossible.  Unfortunately it's a very different situation when they've come to rely on you as a top performer.  It's a greater loss to them, and they take it very, very personally.\nAdmittedly, I didn't last long after that.  I ended up in a shouting match with my boss, who then demanded that I write my own PIP and present it the next day.  I physically could not degrade myself like that, and so I tendered my two-week notice instead.  It was the last day anyone at the firm spoke to me... so I sat around for two weeks twiddling my thumbs.', a user said: 'Lol. Too lazy to write own PIP'",

        "In response to 'Original Post: How to effectively quiet quit as the highest performer on my team I am the team's highest performer. I have a lead IC role (\"hybrid management\") where a lot of my job duties involve coaching, development plans and employee growth. I am one of two lead ICs and there are like 3-4 other ICs on the team.\nOver the past two years, I've taken this position very seriously and have operated at a much higher level (the position above mine) than expected. I was rapidly promoted to lead IC in less than a year and I have been told that going into full management is \"mine if I want it\". The difference between myself and the other ICs on the team (including lead IC) is pretty dramatic. I'm easily doing twice or three times the workload and have a much higher operational proficiency, client satisfaction, etc.\nFor a plethora of reasons, I've become totally disillusioned with the institution, middle/upper management, and the position. What's compounding my anger/depression is that I took my position as a downgrade in my career, but intended to be underpaid and underappreciated for 2-ish years to build up hands-on experience in a new industry. I've been ACTIVELY trying to get OUT and make a lateral or upwards move (externally, not internally as my institution does not offer internal jobs) and because of the PARTICULARLY shitty state of the white-collar job market (\"worse than 2008\"), I have been faced with rejection after rejection after rejection, usually after getting 99% of the way there. I also have particular grievances about the way that middle/upper management has \"strung me along\" on a variety of promises. I look back and see that I'm literally ROTTING in what was supposed to be a temporary position, in the prime years of my career, and I feel STUCK (can't get out no matter how hard I try).\nIt's important to note that I really don't *like* the idea of quiet-quitting. I always used to say \"why would you quiet quit? Just go find a better job that you feel fulfilled in\". The problem now is that I'm so bitter at the institution that putting in extra effort feels nauseating and violating, and I'm STUCK at this job due to the extremely terrible job market (unless I restart my career entirely or quit without a job lined up).\nAnyways, circling back to the point of my question: I've become widely known as such an aggressive overperformer that my bosses have flat-out told me that overperformance has become my new baseline for expected monthly performance. I used to easily get \"exceeds expectations\" every month, whereas now they want me to continuously struggle and squeeze every drop of effort out of myself just to justify a \"meets expectations\". My goal for quiet quitting is to start putting in the same amount of effort as the other lead IC, who notoriously underperforms but is never held accountable. However, it's going to become extremely and immediately apparent as soon as my next monthly performance evaluation hits, and my managers are going to be asking me \"WTF is going on\".\nI fear that this will immediately result in 1-2 months of \"does not meet expectations\", followed swiftly by a PIP or something like that. I'll be told to go back to my previous baseline, and when I don't, I'll be accused of insubordination or something. I really don't want to deal with this level of mental stress, especially as I'm already highly depressed from my rejections while job-searching.\nDo any managers here have an idea of what I should do to effectively and smartly go from \"ultra top performer\" to quiet-quitter?', a user said: 'Have some pride in your craft and refuse to lower your own standards. Don’t quiet quit. Demand a raise. Demand a promotion . Quit outright like the damn champ you are if they won’t. If you quit and they want to hire you back, ask for twice as much more than you requested befor quitting. Ask for your superiors position. Email your CEO. In fact, walk into his office.'",

        "In response to 'I actually am really good at coding and building performance improvement tools to automate processes. I have done that a lot in my current role. However, an AI agent cannot do my job. I cannot even do my job from home. It has to be done in the office and it is client-facing. I actually do have an idea to develop an ERP for small businesses, though, because I am exposed to a lot of small businesses at my job. Maybe I should just quit with nothing else lined up and just do that and see if I can develop something that will benefit small business owners', a user said: 'I’d suggest not quitting . I don’t believe in quiet quitting. You quit with valor and take that with you into whatever you do next . Quiet quitting It sets you up to accept failure and mediocrity vs solving the issue. I suggest demanding more. What I did a few times in my young career- I just didn’t go to work one day. Came back next day like nothing happened. Did this 3 times- I got 10-15% raise within a week offered to me each time,'",
        "In response to 'Fundamentally, this job was always going to be a 1-2 year stepping stone position for me where I accepted being underpaid in order to get, in exchange, a large amount of industry experience and flex/demonstrate transferrable skills that I could use throughout the rest of my career. The problem I'm experiencing now is that due to factors outside my control, I cannot escape this job now and I'm extremely bitter at the institution and the management for stringing me along. Even if they offered me a 15% raise tomorrow, I would not suddenly want to stay.\nIf they created a new position for me, which they EASILY could justify (loan specialist) based on my workload, the value I bring to the org, etc, then I would stay and take on that new role. But they won't do it, they don't care about retaining me. They could also offer me an operational support role and give me an exception so I could work fully remotely in my state, but they won't do that either.
