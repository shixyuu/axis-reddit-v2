        "In response to 'It is not the police's job to prosecute cases.  It is their job to stop/investigate crimes as they are happening and after they have happened, regardless of what they think, or even know the DA and courts will do - obviously this shouldn't be carried to the point of absurdity like busting every single jaywalker, but in the case of something like these bikers, they absolutely should be all over them because the action itself needs to be stopped as it is happening even if the ultimate prosecutions don't happen.', a user said: 'Exactly. This guy’s cousin basically said “we don’t agree with other people so we just don’t do our jobs” like it’s some kind of flex. Everyone in the bay knows SFPD and OPD quite quit the first time they heard someone say “defund the police.” Then even when they get increased funding every year, they sit on their hands and whine for more. If workers quit just because they felt like people didn’t like them, Facebook would have gone under years ago'"
