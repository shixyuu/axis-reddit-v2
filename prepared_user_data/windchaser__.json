        "In response to 'Hmm, I wonder if anything massive and fundamental changed about our economy in the 1970s, something about the very nature of money itself...', a user said: 'Well, China\nmassively\ndevalued their currency and opened their labor markets, which drew in massive foreign investment and started a huge shift in other countries towards outsourcing jobs to there. There was economic precedent there with the other \"Asian Tigers\" (Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), showing that such devaluation and the resulting capital inflows could help undeveloped countries develop quite quickly. South Korea went from a backwater to a global tech leader in a few decades.\nAnyways, so China copied this strategy, and with over a billion workers available, this contributed directly to a hollowing-out of Western manufacturing.\nI know people tend to focus a lot on 1970s inflation or 1980s Reagan policies as being responsible for the shifts in US economy, but it's hard to overstate the impacts of China's policies. They knew what they were doing, and their country has developed very quickly as a result.'"
