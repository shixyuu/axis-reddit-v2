The meals were pretty tasty and seemed healthy enough.\nWe did not give it to the kids. For them we ordered Little Spoon. My son loved his purees and biteables, my daughter was not a fan of the bigger kid meals though.'",
        "In response to 'We tried factor and it was good to start but we felt the quality wasn't worth what we were paying for. We started cook unity (same concept as factor) and the quality is soooo much better, it feels like a home-cooked meal. Not just some ready made microwave meal.', a user said: 'Have you had any quality control issues with cook unity?\nThe meals look great but I got scared off by a reddit post.'"
