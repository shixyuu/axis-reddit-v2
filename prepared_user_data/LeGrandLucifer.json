        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'Why wouldn't they? They work what, 14-16 hours a day? 6-7 days a week? And they're expected to not ask overtime? And for what? A tiny apartment, no worldly possessions beyond like three sets of clothes and basic appliances, no vacations, no leisure time, no family. Why the fuck would anyone who's not a completely brainwashed moron want to support that system?\nThe ruling class has systematically dismantled or neutered all the ways people could fight for better wages and working conditions all while creating worse and worse economic conditions. And now that people are doing the only thing they can do, which is refuse to provide quality labor, they're whining. You know what they want? What they really want? They want slaves. When they see you \"quiet quitting,\" they wish they could beat you until you do what they want you to. They wish they could make an example out of you by killing you. They wish they could literally own you like property. And they're whining because we still haven't reached that point.'"
