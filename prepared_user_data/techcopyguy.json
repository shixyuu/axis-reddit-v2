        "In response to 'Original Post: The corporate owned media the last few days is losing it over \"quiet quitting\". just remember - do the absolute minimum required by your job. they cant do shit. [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/hqym09xm89j91.jpg', a user said: 'They are so off about quiet quitting.  So off....This is what quiet quitting really looks like:\n7:30am girl head off to work, I play on reddit.\n9:30 rolls around, finally take my morning shower... \"dispatched\" to part call I actually fixed Friday\n10:30 rolls around head out to work.  Close that other call, set myself to a real call.  11:30 rolls in, get to first account.  Fix it. (Girl's been working now 2 1/2 hrs)\nNinja kick 3 more copiers for real... have an hour + lunch in a hammock by a lake.\nBe on the road back home by 2-3.  Be back home 3-4.\nSend a couple emails, not working making the day kosher to the person I report to at work (I don't like boss.  Nobody is my boss except for God).\nWork 2-3 hrs, paid 8.  Even had a nap in a hammock (or went shopping at a mall, pick up pet supplies, even get grocery shops in lol).  That's a true quiet quit.  I've quit.  IDGAF.  IF they fire me, they fire me I have quit this job....  quietly ..... I just keep getting a check and keep my health benefits.'"
