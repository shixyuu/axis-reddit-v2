        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: 'I mean, that's how you were always supposed to do it.  You're doing your job.  Slow and steady wins the race.  No sense in overworking and burning yourself out before you reach the finish line.\nAlso remember why you're working in the first place.\nWork is to provide you and your family with funds to live.\nAnyone who says people work because they care for their company or anything within the lines of that is actual BS.\nWork always has been a means to an end, and will ALWAYS be it.'"
