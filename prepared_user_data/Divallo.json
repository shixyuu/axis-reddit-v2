        "In response to 'Yeah, but companies/managers tend to have the mentality of refusing to negotiate when they think they are holding all the cards. They are also only doing this to him because they feel he will put up with it.', a user said: 'They aren't holding all the cards they just want people to think that.\nIf the employee refused the extra workload and his employer fired him now the employer has to hire and train\ntwo\npeople.  and since they would be firing OP that means unemployment insurance rates may rise for the employer.\nIf he gives OP lets say a 33% raise to accept more work he has to hire and train\nzero\nmore people and he doesn't have to fire anyone.\nIf the employer really doesn't want to pay more he might also just keep the employee and try to shunt the work onto someone else but that's still a win for the original employee.'",
        "In response to 'I guarantee you there isn’t an office in the country where you could successfully pull this off. They’d fire you and hire some new schmuck to do the job of both old employees, no question.', a user said: 'The alternative is the employee accepts the work of two people until they quit from burnout.  Accepting it without negotiation also really lowers the chances of any raise in the future because the employee establishes they are willing to \"deal with it\".\nAt least if they try for the negotiation they might get it and if they don't they get unemployment. For bonus points the employee keeps their dignity either way.'",
        "In response to 'Yup. My money is on some think tank as a rebuttal to growing antiwork sentiments.', a user said: 'That's the real answer.  Glad someone said it.\n\"Quiet Quitting\" is the next  \"Nobody wants to work anymore!\"'"
