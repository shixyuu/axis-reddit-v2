        "In response to 'Yeah, husbands think that when their wives stop nagging, asking, prodding, begging, fighting, trying to work on the relationship, etc., that the wives just like decided to be happy and get over whatever was wrong.  Really, it's that the wife is just . . . done.', a user said: 'You hit the nail on the head.\nSomeone else in a separate subreddit said something similar: “When women\naren’t\ncommunicating, that’s when you should be really worried.”'",
        "In response to 'When I was going through that stage, he was cheating on me with my bff. He became worse than he was before. Before the breakup I became dejected, mental health got worse, not his perfect bangmaid anymore. So he fell into my bffs waiting arms. Used not wanting kids or marriage as the excuse, I would’ve left him if he told me that was off the table for him. He always knew that was a deal breaker for me, but the good ole trickle truth.\nI was making a plan to leave without even realizing it, in my mind this was a rough patch and I’d give it a year before I started my last year of my bachelors and either way I was moving.\nDidn’t end up having to do any planning. He left me, kicked me out of our house and honestly I’m so happy. I am grieving the life I had and the people who betrayed me. But that on top of all the other ways he was neglectful and borderline abusive I would never go back', a user said: 'Geez, I’m so sorry you had to go through that. It’s so appalling to me when someone’s best friend sleeps with their SO. You get slapped in the face twice.'"
