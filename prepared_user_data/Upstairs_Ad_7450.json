        "In response to 'I read a nice alternative recently; \"acting your wage\".', a user said: 'As someone who has been disillusioned from just about the very beginning of their working life with the idea of having to work two jobs and 60+ hours just to survive, hearing \"act your wage\" makes me feel the exact opposite of how I assume the ruling class is trying to use the term. I have always felt \"I'm not paid nearly enough to give even the concept of a shit about my employer or company\" so \"acting my wage\" means doing the absolute least I possibly can to avoid being fired since my employer is paying me the absolute least THEY possibly can to allow me to survive in this capitalist hell'"
