        "In response to 'Original Post: I didn't get the promotion. Should I quit or quiet quit? A few months ago everyone in my team was let go apart from me. I was then told I could apply for my old manager's role. I applied but have now been told I didn't get the role and they are going with an external candidate.\nFor these past few months I have basically been doing this promotion role (and have received really good feedback from lots of senior people). I have not gotten a payrise to do all this extra work.\nI want to leave before this candidate starts because I'm tired of giving them essentially cheap labour. I was told if I didn't get this promotion, another role would be made available for me (in the same team), so I would probably have lots of leverage to negotiate a payrise. But I really don't want to have to essentially train this new external candidate who will be making more than double what I earn in the role I didn't get.\nShould I hand in my notice now, do a shitty handover and let the new person flounder? Or should I stay in my role with more money, but be looking for jobs on the side (it could be months and months before I find a good job). If I do immediately quit, I do have savings I could live on for 6+ months (took me years to save this amount).\nWhat would you do? Any advice?', a user said: 'Hey bud same thing happened to me. Take advantage of whatever benefits you have, don’t quit. Prep your resume, do they offer educational benefits/resources?\nFocus on elevating your situation, commit to the essential responsibilities of your job description.\nWhen I got passed up for another internal candidate with less tenure, the embarrassment had me red in the face and I was angry. I realized my behavior impacts people around me which would be worse off than not getting a lousy promo that’s just more work for mediocre pay.\nHead up, prep that resume. It’s a rough market.'"
