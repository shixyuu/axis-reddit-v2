Then, you can’t retire because you need the money. Even if you do well early on and get yourself financially stable, your health will continue to decline. So, you have all if the costs of keeping insurance, meeting deductibles, office/out-of-office fees, the percentage that insurance doesn’t cover, etc.\nThe entire system is meant for us to work up until the moment we die. That is, unless if you’re rich. Then you get to sit back and turn on easy mode.'"
