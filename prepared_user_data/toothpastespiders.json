If it's a desk job, I agree. If it's trying to find the best treatment option for someone newly diagnosed with late-stage cancer I think the desire is laudable even if it doesn't usually work out in practice.'",
        "In response to 'Its actually very common for people to not have reliable social circles these days.\nSomething like over half of the population is experiencing loneliness in this generation. Rates of depression and anxiety are also at all time highs. High rates of work from home is probably just going to intensify this issue tbh.\nAs for myself i have a decent-ish social circle but it could be better. Im lucky enough to be working with my 10-year really good friend tho and work at a mall and know a lot of the people who work here which helps a lot in supplementing that. Helps a lot in serving as a good social outlet which i wouldnâ€™t otherwise have if i did wfh.', a user said: 'And the strength of the connections is typically far more flimsy than people assume. One of the first things most people experience after a late-stage cancer diagnosis is their social circle dropping off to an extreme degree. The people there for you when your worst day is a bad breakup aren't necessarily going to be there when your worst day involves trying not to vomit your meds up when looking for burial plots.'"
