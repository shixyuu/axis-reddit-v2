Won’t they need senior leaders?\nI have been in hospitality my entire career and it sucks - I am so over the expectation that I have to pick up the slack or help when we are short staffed; “duties as assigned” is the biggest boomer scam. Basically means working evenings and weekends the entire peak / tourist season with “lieu days if you work an 8 hour shift” and no other compensation.\nQuiet quitting for me means saying no, I will not work these extra hours for free. I will leave early on a Friday if I have to work extra hours, I will ensure I get MY TIME back.'",

I am just going to keep sweeping my side of the street.', a user said: 'That is so fuckijg annoying. Question: do you find some of the young males as sexist as boomers? It is almost shocking what I’ve seen and heard from some of them.'"
