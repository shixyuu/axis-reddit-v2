        "In response to 'It's called work-life balance.  Some of us have finally figured out that is a real thing. We still go to work every day we are supposed to.  We still work our hours.  But we aren't checking email at night.  We aren't working on the weekends.  If the boss gives me more work than I can do in a day - some of it won't get done while I shut down my computer at 5:00pm. And I'm fine with that.', a user said: 'I had our CEO tell me that work-life balance is bullshit. He told me work is just part of the life and that while you may need to work, you have to live and enjoy life outside of work too. Under him we got increased PTO, several pay increases, company stock, and all sorts of new benefits. Whenever he came to town, he spent time with us (not just photo ops) and was really great. He told the board of directors and other executives that what would set us apart is how we treat our employees and that they needed to invest there instead of their exorbitant bonuses and raises.\nThe board forced him to resign right after.'"
