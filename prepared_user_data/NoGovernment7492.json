        "Got my boomer parents to say I should quiet quit. So I started a new job 8 days, 6 business day, ago. This is CapitalOne, by the way. Today, my HR manager gives me a call and tells me that I can either take a 25% pay cut or leave my job. I'm not even done onboarding yet, as they want me to watch nearly 40h of trainings along with applying for all my permissions without telling me what they are. On top of that, this was always meant to be a hold-me-over type of jobs, as I already took about a 30% pay cut for this job, but I had been unemployed for nearly a year, and wanted to stop bleeding money. And so I talked afterwards, in private, to some of my team members, and apparently this is just normal behavior for the company.\nMy parents gave me a call for the holidays after work. They asked me how the new job was going, and I told them about it. Both my parents are avid Fox News watcher, and had been complaining about the \"quiet quitting epidemic\" for sometime. My dad, was like, oh you should quit and find a better opportunity, but my mom interrupted my dad and told me that I should \"Take the offer, look for a new job, and do the bare minimum at my current position\". I informed her that, that is literally \"quiet quitting\", and she without missing a beat told me to \"quiet quit\" and my dad soon followed suit.\nMy parents might be pushing 80, but I'm glad I finally got them to see the light of how messed up our economy is. And I feel very proud about it, prouder than most other things in my life, and I made discoveries in my industry that fundamentally changed it, and you know what, I feel more proud about this, than I do that.",
        "In response to 'Please review the company on GlassDoor or something. This is gross behavior and good to warn other people about.\nCongrats on the boomer parents supporting you. That's awesome!', a user said: 'I've never done a glass door review before, but will certainly put one in when I'm less intoxicated tomorrow.'",
        "In response to '25% cut 8 days into the job is wild. Capital One is behaving like this!?  This surprises the shit outta me.', a user said: 'Yeah, I told all my friends about this BS, and they pulled/are starting to pull their stocks out of CapitalOne. As, at least from this experience, all their employees are probably very disgruntled. I had been wondering about that, as since I joined, they all seemed very disgruntled, but it is hard to tell with new people.'",
        "In response to 'What kind of job is this if you don’t mind me asking? I see capital one take advantage of a lot of their interns.', a user said: 'I work in AI and Security with over 15 years of industry experience.'",
        "In response to 'What’s in your wallet? Nothing? Then you’ll take this pay cut and like it.', a user said: 'More than enough, but as my mom said, \"It pays better than unemployment\". The new rate is at the 10% margin of the market rate for my job, and it literally less than I made straight out of college, 15 years ago, during the height of the 2008 crisis, not even accounting for inflation. Also, I had already refused 2 jobs offers that pay more than this rate before taking my job at CapitalOne.\nWhen I graduated, I watched people lose everything because they only kept 6 months of expenses in their bank account. Because before the 2008 crisis, people told you to keep 6 months of expenses in your bank account in case anything happened, such as losing your job. After the 2008 crisis, they told you to keep 18 months.\nBut because I've been able to mostly stay afloat with just unemployment, I still have about 16 months left in my savings. FYI, you can stretch unemployment to a year if you only take it every other week.'"
