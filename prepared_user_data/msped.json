Where an employee does everything asked of them for years and doesn't get a payrise or promotion.', a user said: 'I got a pay rise of £300 going into the next scale and told I have to go through the increments again which means I won’t get the full rise till 2024. Even though the role change because of jobs I’ve been doing for 3+ years which means I would of gone through the increment already.\nThink I’m busting my arse for 20.3k a year? Hell no. After the shit HR tried to pull at the start of the year I’m ready to quit.'"
