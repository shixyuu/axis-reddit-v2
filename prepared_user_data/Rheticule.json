        "In response to 'Work ethic?\nI spent 5 years living in Japan, and from what I saw in the white collar industry a lot of that ‘worth ethic’ is face time.\nWhy were all the workers taking random naps at their desk during the day instead of just getting a good nights sleep? Because it wasn’t socially acceptable to leave the office until their boss had left, and he didn’t leave until 9.  Then they all had an hour commute home. These were not super productive people. They were worn out for no good reason. There is no work life balance.\nYou’d occasionally have someone who dared have a hobby or a work life balance, you could easily point them out because they were well rested and happy. They were also social and workplace outcasts.\nA lot of Japans social issues would be eased by a better work / life balance. For that to happen it would mean a massive top down social change.', a user said: 'I worked for a Japanese company at a regional office outside Japan, but it had about 50-60% ex-pats from Japan working there.\nNothing will put a stop to your thoughts of \"Japanese efficiency\" more than working at a company like that. You are 100% correct. You aren't allowed to leave before your boss, who can't leave before his, who... you get the idea. So everyone is just sleeping at their desks until they're allowed to leave.\nI also noticed someone using a spreadsheet, but adding up two columns of numbers with a calculator, one set at a time. It was... mindblowing. He was taking HOURS to do what was a 7 second job. When I asked him if he wanted me to show him a better way he said no, because then he wouldn't have enough work to do.\nI lasted a year, mostly because I left at my usual time every day without playing those silly games. I was told off by HR a few times but ignored them (I had young children, I'm not spending 0 time with them for no benefit).'"
