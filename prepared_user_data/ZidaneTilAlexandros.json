So a 3% pay cut. Then I started working to rule. Doing my best and still overachieving but refusing additional work, taking on more shit or taking other managers (outside my teams) bullshit. That apparently warrants an \"are you ok\" talk. Which turned into retention conversation with the promise of potential future reward.', a user said: 'Me too! The second I stopped going above and beyond, and working basically two jobs in one. I got the, “oh man I want the old zidaneTilAlexandros back, what happened? Is everything okay?” Talk.'"
