        "In response to 'There’s no such thing as PhD material, that’s such an elitist way to blow off legitimate struggles students experience due to barriers that are known to exist in higher ed for nearly everyone.', a user said: 'Username checks out.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: I’m quiet quitting my PhD I’m over stressing about it. None of this matters anyway. My experiment failed? It’s on my advisor to think about what I can do to still get this degree. I’m done overachieving and stressing literally ruining my health over this stupid degree that doesn’t matter anyway. Fuck it and fuck academia! I want to do something that makes me happy in the future and it’s clear academia is NOT IT!\nEdit: wow this post popped off. And I feel the need to address some things.\n1. I am not going to sit back and do nothing for the rest of my PhD. I’m going to do the reasonable minimum amount of work necessary to finish my dissertation and no more. Others in my lab are not applying for as many grants or extracurricular positions as I am, and I’m tired of trying to go the extra mile to “look good”. It’s too much.\n2. Some of yall don’t understand what a failed fieldwork experiment looks like. A ton of physical work, far away from home and everyone you know for months, and at the end of the day you get no data. No data cannot be published. And then if you want to try repeating it you need to wait another YEAR for the next season.\n3. Yes I do have some mental and physical health issues that have been exacerbated by doing this PhD, which is why I want to finish it and never look back. I am absolutely burnt out.', a user said: 'How do you get “no data?” Also why would finishing your degree be on your advisor.\nMaybe don’t quiet quit and just quit. Why keep doing it if you aren’t happy?'",
        "In response to 'I’ll be happy when it’s done lol. Only 1.5 years left seems wrong to throw it away now. All things considered my career is on a good trajectory, I’m just burnt out. No data because all of my plants died from drought. Not really publishable to say that plants need water to live. Not saying it’s on my advisor to finish the degree but it can’t just be me spinning my wheels on my own anymore.', a user said: '“All plants died due to drought” is not an earth-shattering discovery but still represents data, and probably a ton of variability in the data as well. And if it varies it can covary. Dissertations don’t typically change the world, the are demonstrations that you can do the work and interpret the results. Maybe this won’t be acceptable for a journal in its barest form, but it can provide the raw material for a passable dissertation AND give a springboard for an eventual publication afterwards.\nMy experiment for my dissertation had tons of garbled data and initially seemed unusable. Plus I had one of the most demanding scientists in the field as my advisor, so I was in the same place as you for quite a long while. I’m not gonna give you a “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” pep talk, but remember your training and what you’ve learned. Take a break and revisit. Use the strategies you know.'"
