        "In response to 'Being asked myself to go from full time WFH to hybrid. You better bet I am going to deliberately slow down my productivity on those office days, besides the fact it will naturally happen due to all the “collaboration”.\nAlso pulling way back on my flexibility with my hours when asked, no more jumping on for the odd thing for 5 mins after hours.\nI always thought my employment accommodations and compensation were a negotiation with my employer independent of my work colleagues. Apparently no it’s unfair to others who are hybrid if I’m WFH.', a user said: 'This so much. Became a lot less flexible with my hours. I no longer stay that extra 30 mins to help a colleague figure something out. At my 8 hour mark I immediately walk out that office. Idc if it's mid convo. My coworker can be talking directly to me and I'll just turn and walk out the office while they are talking. I just don't care anymore. I rather not sit there and let them talk to me for 30 mins about something I don't care about then have an extra 40 mins added to my commute because I leave RIGHT before the wave of traffic hits so every second counts for me if I don't want to be in traffic for longer than I already am with my hour and a half commute.\nMy productivity has gotten worse and idc. My employeer quite literally said to us \"you all are more productive at home than in the office, but you lose the collaboration so we are being you back in\". That told me they value collaboration more than productivity, so why be productive, they want us talking more so I'll talk for most of my shift and work as little as possible since collab is more important than productivity.'"
