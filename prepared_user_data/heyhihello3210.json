        "In response to 'Original Post: I think my remote team mate is quiet quitting And it's ticking me off. Need advice if I should say something?\nMy team is fully remote,  spread  across the US. Our individual and team metrics are tracked by the amount of tickets we process on a weekly basis. This is a FULL time job and I've found that a member of our team is only logging about 4 hours a day - if that! Meanwhile, the rest of the team is putting in 9 hr days just to keep up with the volume.  We've also had to log in and work the last two Saturdays just to clear the backlog.  If this person would just work a normal day,  it would lighten the load on each of us. Our manager hasn't seemed to notice that this  person's \"numbers\" are half of what the other team members are producing. Do I speak up or keep my trap shut,  silently seething all day?\n**Thank you everyone for your input! I'm not going to do my managers job for them,  if they don't care,  I won't care either.  I'll hit my targets and focus on my career advancement in 2025.', a user said: 'Why are you agreeing to work OT if you don’t get paid for the extra hours? That’s madness and I would never.\nThis is definitely a manager problem. I have had a situation like this as well where there was a slacker in the group and we were easily tracked by the ticket numbers to see how much work we were all doing. The rest of us in the group all noticed the slacker and we ended up putting together an email that we sent to our manager. Our manager did end up talking to the guy and the guy ended up sending us all a group email apologizing for his behavior and acknowledging that he knew he was making us all do more work. He didn’t end up improving that much though. I’m 90% sure he was having depression problems, but it is definitely annoying to have a slacker like that in the group. He slacked off for an entire year before he did eventually get fired/persuaded into quitting.\nIf I were you, I would not say anything. I would just do my normal work load. Nothing more, maybe a little bit less on some days. I would not be going above and beyond everyday and I certainly wouldn’t be working on weekends if I was not getting paid for it. I’d likely work some of the Saturdays if I was getting paid OT though.'"
