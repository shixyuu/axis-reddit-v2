        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: '\"Quiet quitting\" is a bullshit corporate propaganda line. Workers are just finally realizing that they actually don't get anything in return for the free work we're all just expected to put in at the benefit of only the executive who gets to save a few bucks on labor costs. The real injustice is that it's been accepted for decades that workers at all levels just have to sacrifice free time and labor to their bosses for nothing beyond an acknowledgment for it if they're lucky.'"
