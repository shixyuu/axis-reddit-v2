        "In response to 'Ppl that use \"unskilled work\" to justify paying ppl less than they need to sustain their life are scum. That being said, unskilled is still a valid description for certain types of work. Stocking shelves at a supermarket for instance. Its important work and someone has to do it, no doubt. And that someone shouldnt have to chose between food and heating. Nevertheless, it is work that doesnt require special skills so its unskilled work. Unskilled =/= useless or unimportant.', a user said: 'If the pandemic and resulting lockdowns revealed anything it's that those that stock the shelves and perform other \"unskilled labor\" make up a large segment of those \"essential workers\" that keep the economy and society functioning.\nThose workers absolutely deserve a living wage.'",
        "In response to 'So? If you have food you bought it with your employer’s money.', a user said: 'It's only my employer's money until I have performed my agreed upon labor and have been compensated. At that point, it's my money. Any food or anything else I have purchased are mine, paid for with my money.'",
        "In response to 'If you have a savings account you’re getting paid too much.', a user said: 'If your employer has millions in the bank, multiple residences, a sizeable investment portfolio, offshore accounts, and tax havens, they are stealing far too much of the value of your labor from you and your coworkers.'"
