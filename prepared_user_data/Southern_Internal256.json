        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'Yea, agree. Research on the religion was what made me hard quit cus I was thinking of quiet quitting. I do not support it at all!'"
