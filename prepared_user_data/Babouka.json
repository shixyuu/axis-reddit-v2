If he was supposed to work from 8 to 4 and he fool around instead of working then he didn't do his job.\nMy neighbor is 65 years old and he is quiet quitting as well. However his contract stated he needs to be on the floor from 7 to 2pm and complete these following items by the end his day. He does them all. What he don't do anymore is getting there at 6 and leaving at 4 unpaid to help others, mostly management, with their work.'"
