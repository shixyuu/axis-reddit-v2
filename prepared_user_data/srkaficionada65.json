        "In response to 'Yeah. That family shit goes out the door when you're being escorted out lolol', a user said: 'LOL. I have a weekend gig and they hired a new manager. Why the dumbass kept saying we’re family in their first meeting baffled me. Like my dude, y’all ain’t got benefits, don’t pay overtime, no holiday pay and if I gotta call out, I gotta find someone to work that shift… yet, we’re family. Kept telling the dumbass to stop using the term because I ain’t their family(and I can barely stand my own family and I don’t even like working when this manager is on shift with me). They weren’t amused but I kept saying it every time they finished a sentence with “I want this to feel like family”. 😒😒'"
