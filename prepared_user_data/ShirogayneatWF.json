        "In response to 'I think they are slowly, but it takes a lot of work and a need for the old gen to retire before changes really take hold. Same problem we are having here in the US.', a user said: 'Exactly. Although the rugged individualist attitude we have in the US has been a poison pill for most things, it does have the benefit that people won't hesitate to tell an employer where to go shove it.'",
        "In response to 'Work ethic?\nI spent 5 years living in Japan, and from what I saw in the white collar industry a lot of that ‘worth ethic’ is face time.\nWhy were all the workers taking random naps at their desk during the day instead of just getting a good nights sleep? Because it wasn’t socially acceptable to leave the office until their boss had left, and he didn’t leave until 9.  Then they all had an hour commute home. These were not super productive people. They were worn out for no good reason. There is no work life balance.\nYou’d occasionally have someone who dared have a hobby or a work life balance, you could easily point them out because they were well rested and happy. They were also social and workplace outcasts.\nA lot of Japans social issues would be eased by a better work / life balance. For that to happen it would mean a massive top down social change.', a user said: 'Nothing has illustrated this more clearly than learning that the life expectancy of manga artists is a full 20\nyears\nlower than the national average, in a country that is one of, if not\nthe\nlongest lived culture on Earth.'",
        "In response to 'Japan's work ethic from every source I found is absolutely insane.\nIt needs to decline and fully readjust.  Japan does a lot of things right, their \"work ethics\" isn't one of them.\nAlthough, I will fully admit, I could be very wrong and I have only listened to propaganda.  I've not been, I've not experienced, therefore I could be wrong.', a user said: 'No, I've lived there and it's very much like that.'"
