        "In response to 'Japanese worker productivity has been low for decades.  It is not a new phenomenon.\nhttps://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h02240/', a user said: 'There is also the fact that they value working hard and a lot over working effektive or efficient. Add to that they they literally can't say \"no\" or \"I need to finish that first\" when given a new project, means that they are often working on so many things at once that often don't make any progress on one single thing and that many companies are basically zombies on life support it becomes clear that there is often no real different between normal work and quite quitting in terms of output.'",
        "In response to 'It's worrying that 45% of workers in Japan are quietly quitting... but I wonder if the survey really gets to the heart of why this is happening or if it's just a symptom of something bigger, like a changing attitude toward work in a more modern economy.', a user said: 'I am more interested if it is more the older, younger or middle generation.'"
