        "In response to 'I’m with you on this. I actually tried to end our relationship a week or so ago, but saw some nasty SH marks which threw me into self doubt? I don’t feel right just leaving immediately after seeing that either, but I’m not taking no for an answer with asking him to go to therapy about it and to improve MH in general. \nIt’s just the same conversations again and again, and no change. I’m tired of it and just feel like I’m being used. I’m kind of hoping he gets put off of me at this point without being toxic, just putting in the same level of effort… \nIt’s the crappiest thing and the thought of just being alone is weirdly good to me. Good luck to you, I don’t really have advice but solidarity I guess!', a user said: 'I don't know your age or circumstances, but you are\nnot\nresponsible for anyone else's mental health beyond not being unreasonably cruel.\nIf you have concerns they will harm themselves you can alert friends or family- or call a wellness check if they make any threats towards SH etc.\nDon't stay just for that, you deserve to be happy.'"
