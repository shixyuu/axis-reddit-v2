        "In response to 'I always wonder how enforceable this actually is — I mean, I can see it for one off things (there's some event so you have to stay late). But if the company gets bigger/busier, when is it the company's responsibility to hire more staff vs you being told to pick up the pace?\nAs in, to put concrete numbers on it — if you could get all the work done in 39hrs people would expect that you just have to suck it up & work late / through lunch. What if it's more like 47.5hrs hours & you're doing that indefinitely?', a user said: 'I worked for an organisation which typically expected everyone to do 50-60 hours a week. I finally said to my manager I  am doing 70 hours a week, my health is suffering I am not willing to do this anymore. She said I was to cut back to no more than 50 hours a week and she would see about additional resource. We were all salaried, no overtime and we were all contracted to do 37 hours pw. The contract targets could not be delivered with the resource we had. Unsurprisingly, staff turnover was an issue.'"
