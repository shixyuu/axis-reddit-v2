        "In response to 'I really hate that term “quiet quitting.” It makes me think of you just handing in your resignation and just leaving your job.\nI know it really means working to the rules of your handbook and blah blah blah.', a user said: 'I've seen it said that the word \"quitting\" in that phrase is of the British vernacular.  As in, \"When do you quit for the day?\"  Afterwards, you go silent - don't answer calls, text messages, emails, etc., from work.  In that context, it makes a lot more sense.'"
