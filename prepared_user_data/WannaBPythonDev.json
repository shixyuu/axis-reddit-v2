If you’re fine fucking over others for your own gain when there’s no reason it has to be you or me, that’s your own moral standard to live with. I’m sure you’ll appreciate when others do it to you.', a user said: 'Dude, you’re OE!\nDon’t talk about character and integrity when you’re doing OE. You’ve given up that moral high ground that day you signed your second employment contract and started your OE path.\nThe only thing different between you and the guy that got fired is the company doesn’t know that you’re doing the same thing.\nDo you think your employer(s) will smile, give you a pat on the head and say, “wow, impressive job managing X other jobs, at the same time we are paying you. We’ll let You keep doing that because you are doing a great job for us anyway”?\nNo!\nIf they find out that you also OE - you’re either going to be fired or asked to quit your other job(s)!\nSo bottom line, in the company’s eyes, there is no difference between a good OE’r and the one’s who ended up coasting to their last paycheck.'"
