        "In response to 'This is exactly why I left a job I was working at for 4 years. The only \"raise\" I got was because the minimum wage went up, when I got hired I was making $3 above minimum wage.\nAfter 4 years of working there, my hourly wage technically went down to minimum wage, while my responsibilities ended up increasing until I was doing most of the managers responsibilities.\nThey hired this new woman at $4 more than me, she rubbed it in my face thankfully, and after I spent a week training her she ended up going MIA because she got arrested. Never saw her again.\nI wrote a long email to my manager asking if I could get a raise considering my hourly wage technically went down over the course of 4 years, and this new woman who immediately got arrested was hired at $4 more than me. I even acknowledged that this woman may have had more qualifications when she got hired, but I had been working there for 4 years and took on a ton of managerial responsibilities.\nI was given some BS about how it's not in the budget even though it was a multi millionaire company. I quit a month later. I have gone through about 15 more jobs since then, and I get compliments for my hard work but nothing to ever back it up. Most managers want to milk us for the most work and the least amount of pay. I have never had a manager/ boss actually care about taking care of me.', a user said: 'But, theyre very eager to tell you that they cARe about you so much,. Its one of the first things they whip out at the interview; how they want their employees happy, and theyer a fAmuleE. Sometimes there are multiple posted signs declaring these sentiments. I, however, dont believe a word any employer or superior says to me. I only listen enough to compare their words with their actions over time.'"
