I moved to a more expensive area (90% of the company is work from home) and it just so happened to align with the company rolling out a incentive to bump everyone to 90% of the average pay rate for your home area. I got a 10% bump in pay while only some of the other employees only got a 2-3%. On the flip side, if you were at the average or higher, you didn't get any increase. If it wasn't for those things lining up perfectly, I would have been in the 2-3% group.'"
