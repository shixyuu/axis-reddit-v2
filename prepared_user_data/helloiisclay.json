        "In response to 'Work to rule is doing fully adequate and expected work, and no more.\nThat's not fully covering it though. Work-to-rule is closer to the sorts of things you'd see on\n/r/MaliciousCompliance\n. Taking FULL time for every minute task, never skipping or being quick about even the most mundane inspection or interaction. Double-checking every order, doing your inventory three times before clocking out, etc. The same way you regularly break minor traffic laws.', a user said: 'The minor traffic laws metaphor I think fits well.\nWork-to-rule is driving exactly the speed limit no matter what. Yea, you can drive 5 over the speed limit (get your work done faster by cutting a little corner here or there), but the rules are the rules.\nQuiet quitting is driving how you did, but only when you have to. You're cutting out the road trips and only driving what's necessary (working only within working hours and within your job description).\nIt's a subtle difference, but there is a difference between the two.'"
