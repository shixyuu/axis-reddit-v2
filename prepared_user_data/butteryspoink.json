        "In response to 'steel rice bowl\nNever heard this one before', a user said: 'Huh pretty interesting idiom, per Gemini:\nWhile \"steel rice bowl\" isn't a direct saying on its own, it's very closely related to a significant idiom in Chinese culture: \"iron rice bowl\" (鐵飯碗 - tiě fàn wǎn).\nThe \"iron rice bowl\" is a metaphor for a job with guaranteed job security and stable benefits, akin to life tenure. Traditionally, this referred to positions in the civil service, state-owned enterprises, and the military. The idea is that an iron bowl is unbreakable, ensuring that one will always have rice (i.e., a livelihood).\nTherefore, while not the exact phrase you asked about, the concept of a durable, reliable bowl is indeed used in Asian cultures, particularly Chinese culture, to symbolize job security and a stable means of earning a living. A \"broken rice bowl,\" on the other hand, signifies losing one's job.'"
