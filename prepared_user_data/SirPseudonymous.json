        "In response to 'Because we are on opposing sides? Businesses that run on profit want to pay employees as little as they can for the most work to keep labor costs down, and employees want to do as little work as possible for the most money. We have attempted to find a happy medium (it still sucks), but unfortunately, employees only benefit with communicating frankly if the company does, and the company currently doesn't benefit from communicating frankly. The power imbalance between a business and a lone employee, even a union most of the time, is so severely slanted in the businesses direction its laughable.\nIt's a prisoners dilemma. We could all be better off cooperating, but because we can't trust the other group, we dissent to avoid getting screwed over.', a user said: 'We could all be better off cooperating\nThere fundamentally cannot be cooperation between labor and owners except when they are one and the same, equally and equitably. For owners to make money they did not work for (profit), that means the people producing all of the value did not receive money they\ndid\nwork for (extracted surplus value).\nThe only way to rectify this is to eliminate the autocratic and extractive side that steals away wealth while seeking to squeeze every last drop from workers, and replace it with equitable ownership and democratic control by the workers.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'You're giving far-right propaganda rags owned by oligarchs and staffed by the most malevolent failchildren of the upper class far too much credit. They're not naively chasing clicks, they're cynically pushing far-right propaganda to manufacture consent for a crackdown on labor.'"
