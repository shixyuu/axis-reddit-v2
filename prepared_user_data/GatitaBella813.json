        "In response to 'Something I love about doing the One Bag thing of carrying only enough clothes for maybe 3-4 days is that it\nforces\nme to do laundry every 3-4 days. Some find it to be a downside, but for me is a big plus, budgeting a couple lazy hours to find a laundromat, wash, dry, fold, get back to the hotel... it's a great way to slow down and find some sense of normalcy, kind of a zen routine. You mingle with the locals, maybe read a book while you wait, maybe pop into some grocery store nearby and grab a byte, and you don't get that \"I should be using this time to go see that thing\" feeling, bc you're\nknow\nyou're doing something you\nneed\nto do, you don't get a choice.\nAdmittedly, I only take trips on the shorter side of this sub's standards, a week, maybe two, at a time, and it'll probably get old if you have to do it a couple times a week for a month or more, but for\nmy\nneeds, it's a great fit.', a user said: 'Agree. I also take time to journal in my travel journal and write post cards, etc.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I have learned not to rush it and stuff too much into every day.  But I do agree some days I don't want to do anything or slow down towards the end.'"
