        "In response to 'Original Post: /u/x_v_b explains how the sudden ubiquity of the buzz-phrase \"quiet quitting\" is really just a PR exercise to discourage workers from standing up against wage theft by employers [External Link]: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/x0feqg/whats_up_with_all_these_articles_about_quiet/im91pkm/?context=3', a user said: 'Why is there ANY controversy at all around the concept of \"I will do the job you pay me for during the hours we agreed upon during my hiring process\"?\nThat isn't \"quiet quitting\" that's just doing your job. If your employer wants you to do more they should pay you more. If your employer wants you to stay late they should pay you more. If your employer wants you to do more work, out of the office, at home they should compensate you.\nWho has a problem with ANY of that and why? I'll do the job your hired me to do, I'll do it to the best of my abilities, and I will be available during the hours we discussed when you hired me. I'm not doing things outside of my job description, I'm not working more without being paid more. End.\nAgain - what's the problem?'"
