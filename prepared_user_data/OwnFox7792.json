        "In response to 'My opinion - if you are hourly and need to have billable hours... you aren't quiet quitting.\nWhat quiet quitting meant to me was essentially - doing just enough to not get fired or trying to just slip through the cracks so people didn't really notice how much you were or werent working.  For example - my wife manages an executive assistant who is supposed to support a team of people.  She essentially started doing things slow enough where they would just do it themselves.  Now she essentially has the people she's supposed to support, supporting themselves.\nThis has been an issue for around 6 months, but HR moves so slowly so she's still employed and will just be getting on a PIP now, and have another few months before she's let go.  Thats what quiet quitting has always been to me.  Stop doing most or all of your job and hope no one notices.\nPeople who do the minimum of what they're asked and get it done in the requested time are just normal...', a user said: 'This is a great explanation.'"
