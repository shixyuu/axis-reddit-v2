        "In response to '… its worse 💀 if you ever get an EXTRA taped box I mean tape everywhere, of all kinds. Then what probably happened was a driver was loading the van and said “can i deliver this?”  (Box thats practically held together by fibers and faith) To the manager to which they reply “grab the tape”', a user said: 'OMG YES! I thought I was the only one that experienced this. I would get overflows that were just. Ritually destroyed from the warehouse and I would try to refuse them because I know a damaged box will reflect on MY record. 9.9/10 I would get met with “just tape it up and deliver it! You’re just lazy!” Like dawg I’m not delivering a package that the warehouse people (lazy asses) fucked up. Like repackage that shit and then I’ll deliver it lolll.'"
