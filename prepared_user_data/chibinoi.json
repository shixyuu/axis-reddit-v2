        "In response to 'They actually aren’t that productive. Just because you spend 12 hrs in the office doesn’t mean you accomplished more than someone else did in 9. At lot of it is showing dedication, as opposed to outright performance.', a user said: 'It was maybe just a few years ago, but there was a report on a study that looked at the actual effectiveness of production from countries with various work cultures. The USA actually ranked very high, and Japan, China and Korea were all near or\nat\nthe bottom. Meaning the optics of looking busy by being forced via social and cultural expectations (996 for example) to stay late “working” actually resulted in far less shit getting done due to mental fatigue and physical exhaustion.\nIn short, yeah, Japan is way less productive than many Western countries statistically speaking.'"
