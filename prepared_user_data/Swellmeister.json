        "In response to 'Passive perception is special because it was commonly used to take 10 in 3.x and is a passive skill in 5e, so it is the best example of the link between take 10 and passive skills.  Investigation has no equivalent skill in 3.x.  Insight is similar to sense motive in 3.x, but sense motive was most often used in situations where taking 10 was not allowed.', a user said: 'Wat\nPerception wasnt a skill in 3.5. It was combined from spot and listen checks.\nSearch is a skill in 3.5. It, was used in the exact situations you would use investigate, and like investigate, its an INT skill.\nYou could almost always take 10 on sense motive. The rules for taking 10 was you couldn't do it while distracted or threatened. Most of the time you arent distracted or being attacked in a conversation.'"
