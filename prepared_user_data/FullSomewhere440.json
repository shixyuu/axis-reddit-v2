        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'It depends. I service customers for pest control. I make commission on all my stops. 20% usually. While Orkin covers all the overhead. It’s around what I’d make if I ran my own business. As profit. Not revenue of course. Also someone else puts more schedule together for me which makes it very easy. As well as clothes and otherwise are paid for. I write my emails and generally answer the phone until about 8pm if necessary as I have a personal relationship with all my customers and sometimes they have an emergency. Or are just scared and need someone to say it’s gunna be okay. This makes my life much easier during the work day. If you are a tech worker and you are doing service tickets for tech problems after you clock out you are getting fucked'"
