        "In response to 'Original Post: Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing. They just called it “mailing it in” and the movie Office Space is a commentary on this.', a user said: 'I am a 57 year old GenXer. I have been quiet quitting my entire working career with the exception of the four years I served in the navy from 18-22. Life is short. Nobody ever laid on their death bed wishing to have worked harder for someone else to gain wealth. Enjoy your life. Most people do not get to work in their passion, so it is just a means to an end. Treat it as such.'",

There's a reason why the phrase \"no good deed goes unpunished\" exists.', a user said: 'You're correct. It's just a job. There are others.'"
