        "In response to 'I'm a manager and I do not understand this mentality. I want to be known as the boss who proactively fights for raises for staff, treats people with respect, and helps them get promotions in other departments/companies if they want it.\nThat reputation helps me attract good staff, and buys me enough loyalty that people will take pride in their work.\nRefusing to promote someone to save a buck is going to cost you more in the long run.', a user said: 'I'm a manager and fight for my people, but basically can do nothing.  I know who the good ones are and we need to promote and reward. But finance and upper mgmt suck. They say only 10% of your team can 'exceed expectations' during review time. And mid year raises are extremely difficult. And it is 5 levels of people signing off on a raise. I say we should do it, my boss has to sign off, the director has to, the hr person has to, and a VP has to. I fortunately transferred roles so I only have 1 report now, otherwise I'd be looking for a new job.  A $1 an hour raise is huge for some of these people, and it'll cost us thousands to replace them. He'll, maybe 10s of thousands. But that doesn't make this quarter look good, so they don't care.\nPre covid there was a world wide management call where HR said they were focusing on retaining people because our turnover was double industry average. Covid hit, no raises, and turnover is staying high.'"
