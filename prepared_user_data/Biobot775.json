        "In response to 'Senior execs love cutting jobs because that's the easiest way to increase profit margins in the short term. It's really that simple.', a user said: 'It feels like every company has just been doing quarterly layoffs and other forms of headcount reduction to try to maintain the books, until... what? Revenues magically improve? There's nobody left to fire? Total collapse of the balance sheet and bankruptcy?\nI guess it's better to stay afloat/alive another quarter than not, but the end result is the same: if investors don't accept lower returns so as to afford to keep their employees (and therefore keep the business operating), then they'll just strangle their money machines by both crashing their revenue (nobody left to build/develop/maintain their product) and contributing to the crash of their market (nobody has any money left to buy their shit). It's just a slow death spiral instead of a fast one.\nInvestors have no good ideas or ability to solve these issues. That's why they invest, instead of create.'"
