Companies are always trying to save money.\nIf you're not actively positively contributing to the company and increasing it's value, why would you be kept when someone else could?\nBecause someone else is quiet quitting too? If it's the race to the bottom you want, it's the bottom you get. Which is kinda the point of the \"quiet quitting\" panic, no? If the companies cannot economically pressure people then they loose the leverage and thus profits.'"
