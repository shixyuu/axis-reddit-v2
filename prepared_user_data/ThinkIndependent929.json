        "In response to 'I'm sorry dude.\nI remember having this conversation with my therapist and one thing that hurt was when she said, after I mentioned <I'm always the first to help someone..>, she replied, <..and why should you expect anyone to always help you?>\nShe didn't mean it as an insult, she wanted to let me know that not everyone is cut out to helping someone in need, and it then becomes our choice whether we want to be with someone like that or what to do mentally when we wonder where all the help is now, years later.\nI found that the cancer support groups and medical team were more than useful but ultimately there is nothing you can really do to help with someone that has cancer, so doing the very minimum should be the default, yet here we are.\nSorry you're dealing with this', a user said: 'Damn. I needed to hear your therapist's advice too.\nOP, I'm so sorry. I haven't read very far into the thread, but no matter the circumstances, your situation sounds awful. I'm thinking of you, and hope that you can find peace.'",
        "In response to 'My mom has the same empathy as I do and she hates how true that lesson is.\nIt's important to be kind, helpful when YOU CAN BE HELPFUL\nLots of folk either aren't helpful or just refuse to be helpful in any capacity if they don't gain something from you or it\nSad realities but it does help find the right people in your life.  Easier to find the nice folk', a user said: 'I never want to stop being giving and helpful. It’s one of my favorite things about myself.\nI think it comes down to managing expectations. I read this the other day - “expectations are premeditated resentments”.'"
