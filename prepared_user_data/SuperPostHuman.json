Work smarter, not harder. Asian countries like Japan and South Korea need to start transitioning out of the \"economic growth at all costs\" mentality. You can innovate and continue to thrive economically without a soul crushing, family crushing work culture. This type of work culture has hit hard diminishing returns and quite frankly is starting to hurt countries like South Korea and Japan.'"
