        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'Quiet quitting? Just what exactly is that? If you quit you still quit, doesn't matter how you do it. The company is still going to classify it as an employee quitting and not a termination so collecting unemployment will still be challenging for you as an employee to get.\nBut for anyone who does quit, I'll want to ask them, what leverage do you think you draw from that?\nEmployees have no leverage, none whatsoever. I always laughed at the people I see in here when they say they're going to defy the order or quit to try and show the company who's boss. Really, all that's going to happen is the companies will laugh at you because they're either going to outsource your job or hire a college grad who will take $20k less a year to do the job. Either way, the company got rid of someone who wasn't compliant and they save money on refilling the role.'"
