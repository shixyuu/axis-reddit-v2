        "In response to 'On whether Harris should run in 2028: please do not rehabilitate her.\nThe campaign itself was ok, but let's be honest, she was a bad candidate. She got asked on the view whether she would have done anything differently than an 81 year old man with 32% approval, and she couldn't think of a single thing! Why not say Gaza, or that the cost of housing would be more of a priority or something\nHer 2019 primary was also a disaster. And in 49/50 states we lost ground. CA governor? Sure, why not. But please not president, she would lose by even more in 2028. Americans want outsiders, not the ultimate insider.', a user said: 'I like Kamala a lot and I think she is smart, warm, and hilarious. But I agree with you that she's not a great national candidate. She is too cautious and perhaps too kind to have the killer political instincts that candidates like Obama and, in his own idiotic way, Trump have. And she seemingly couldn't bear to break from Biden as she saw it as a betrayal.'",
        "In response to 'And she seemingly couldn't bear to break from Biden as she saw it as a betrayal.\nI wish people said the quiet part out loud on this specific talking point. I don't think it's that she couldn't bear to break away from Biden because she saw it as a betrayal. It's more that Biden didn't tell her explicitly, \"do what you have to do to win; if that means throwing me under the bus; do it twice, just for good measure-- democracy is literally at stake. you'll get no pushback from my team.\"\nBut he didn't do that and I think absent his permission, there would've been Biden loyalists who would've skewered her for weeks on making a break from him and leak stories about how aligned she was with Biden and they are \"dismayed and shocked that she's now betraying President Biden\" and further would've flamed the fires of \"she's a flipflopper with no identity.\"', a user said: 'I think Biden completely let his ego and emotions get in the way, but I don't think the Biden loyalists are actually a powerful force. They're loud on X, but he was so overwhelmingly unpopular - I don't think the betrayal line would have stuck.'",
        "In response to 'Where is her agency in all of this? Why couldn’t she say something like that to him - “Biden we are friends and colleagues and will work together effectively. But during this election I need to win. I will say x and y and z about your performance to create space for my victory.”\nShe had responsibility.', a user said: 'I agree that she had agency and made the wrong choice. I'll even go so far as to say that a public scrap with Biden, if he didn't go graciously into that good night, might have\nhelped\nto make her look anti-establishment.'"
