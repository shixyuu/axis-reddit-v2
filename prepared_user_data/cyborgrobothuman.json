        "In response to 'yeah it's an insidious idea that doing only what you're asked is somehow less than the job requirement.  It doesn't make any sense that the default mode is \"above and beyond\" that completely negates the point of \"above and beyond\" if \"everyone\" is doing it as a baseline.', a user said: 'It’s also funny cause I work for a fairly large corporation that has tons of managers who insist I only work till 5PM. I once offered to make up some perceived lost time on my weekend in an email (I came from a place that frequently had me doing 10-12 hour days, or a 6th day here and there) and got an immediate call from my boss saying “No; your time is your time. We’re fine, and it’ll be good. I’m sure some time between projects will happen at some point and we’ll get caught up then. But we don’t want or expect you to ever work on your time.”\nHeck, my kid got sick and so did my partner, and when I emailed in saying I might need to take a day, I was told to take two. When I mentioned they could use some of my holiday pay to cover the days off, they told me to forget about it and focus on my family.\nMy pay isn’t the highest (but is actually decent for the industry I am in), but this sort of flexibility and having managers who promote the values we preach? I am coming around to the thought here and there that maybe I don’t need to be constantly searching for a new job.\nFunny how being treated like a person will do that to you'"
