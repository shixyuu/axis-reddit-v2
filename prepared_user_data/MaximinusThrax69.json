He was in those old Coors light commercials where the giant people were playing football in the Mountains or some shit. Anyway business wasn't going so well, and the franchising of this particular chain was shady as hell. They took the store away from him and gave it to a weaselly guy who had been asst manager. I showed up to work one morning to find this out, the guy told me the situation, also that I could keep my job part time, at worse hours and he wouldn't be paying me the last paycheck the former owner owed me. I reacted solemnly and told him I guess I'd have to take it. He stuck me with late nights and early Sundays, always alone. So I pretended to ring up product, and pocketed the money for every sandwich I made til I recouped my previous paycheck, with interest. Then I ghosted the place. I'll never understand why he kept me in the first place.'"
