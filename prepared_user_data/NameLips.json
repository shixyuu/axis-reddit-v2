But they've forgotten that in order to attract that level of loyalty, they need to\nshow\nloyalty in return.\nHow hard would you work if your job offered enough to pay your bills, save/invest, go on vacation, buy a house, and retire with a pension?\nI'm betting you'd work your fucking ass off. That's the holy grail -- a company that really cares about its employees and\nshows it with money\n. That's the transaction -- you give me enough resources to buy a decent life, and I'll spend that life providing my labor to you. That's how it's\nsupposed\nto go. Both ways.'"
