        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. 😆', a user said: 'I wouldn’t be surprised if Robyn was dealing with some heavy mental health issues. At the end of the day being “hated” by America has to be hard. She seems like someone that is naturally anxious and I can imagine how filming this show knowing it’s a source of so much pain and suffering can be really hard. But I’m sure to some degree they have to continue on to maintain their lifestyle. I try really hard to humanize Robyn as much as I can. I’m not saying she’s perfect but there’s about 15-20ppl in her immediate life that blame her for ruining a family. I’m sure she’s also carrying the weight of garrisons death as well. That’s a heavy stuff for anyone. I don’t think she feels very great or comfortable about her life right now and it shows.'"
