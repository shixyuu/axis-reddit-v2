We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: '\"Quiet quitting\"\nYou mean doing their job they are paid to do and not more? You want more pay a higher wage and include what you want in the job responsibilities, otherwise get fucked, they are already doing what you pay them to.'"
