Now your manager will have that much more time to chuck shit at you and mentor your way to further thankless exploitation.  You must be reveling in all the additional time you can spend doing someone else's work and saving your boss money.  Be a dynamo and work is it's own reward and it is unlikely you will get anything else.  Highly esteemed Canadian magnate Kevin O'Leary once said, you should want to spend all your time at work and if you didn't have that attitude you'd never work for him anyway, then he'd run you over with his boat\"\n-Kevin O'Leary'",

A bunch of business clowns will happily have a circle jerk for \"solidarity\" and deny reality.  Financial writers have to pander to their readership too.'"
