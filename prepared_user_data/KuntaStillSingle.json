        "In response to 'You talk about how the employer-employee relationship must be mutually beneficial, but “Quiet Quitting”, aka doing the minimum amount of work to not be fired, is neither beneficial to you nor your employer.\nIf you don’t feel you are earning your worth as an employee, then tell your employer that you wish to be compensated or you will quit.  If they don’t compensate you, quit and join another company.   If you can’t be hired to earn more at another company, and/or if your employer doesn’t care if you quit, then you’re not worth much as an employee, so you don’t have a strong case for asking for more compensation.\nIf you’re not worth much as an employee, then putting in the minimum amount to not get fired definitely won’t increase your worth.  You could be putting your income at risk: if the company downsizes then you’ll be first on the chopping block.', a user said: 'Doing that extra work for fear you might get laid off is beneficial to the company alone, and not doing it is beneficial to you because it reduces the extent to which you are underpaid by reducing your workload for the 'same' wage (a steadily decreasing wage.)'"
