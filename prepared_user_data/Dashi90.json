        "In response to 'Original Post: How many of you have \"quiet quit\" and when did it start for you? I got to say for me I quiet quit my last job 5-6 years into it after realizing I didn't have a future with that company, but I never left because I was at least getting paid and now have a decent savings account because of it. I legit started my new job early this year and I've already quiet quitted. I hardly do the bare minimum since I gave them a whole summer of hard work and not a single fucking praise. Or even any kind of \"hey keep it up you've been doing an awesome job\". The moment I make a mistake I feel like it destroys everything i worked hard for so what's the point anymore? I'm just going to keep working enough so I don't get fired, but if I do I doubt I'll be upset over it. It also just seems the way 2023 has went if the economy and housing market continues to stay awful next year I can already see people quiet quitting for 2024 and it hasn't even started yet!', a user said: '3 years ago.
