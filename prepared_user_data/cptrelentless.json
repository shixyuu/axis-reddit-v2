        "In response to 'Are you saying that if there's a vague clause in your contract like the GP mentioned, you should either \"grin & bear it\" or leave, but you think work to rule isn't a reasonable option to take?\nOf course as the employee, you should push for a raise (thin on the ground) or get a better job. But my point was more from the point of view of unfair/constructive dismissal if you refused to stay late.\nIf the work is open ended, I'd argue that it's not reasonable for you to work more hours in order to get as much as possible done just because of that clause in your contract.\nThat's very different to something tangible e.g. you're the office manager & you have to stay late to lock up because the security guard called in sick.', a user said: 'The law says you should only work 48 hours a week, anyhow.'"
