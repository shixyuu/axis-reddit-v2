        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'Well , you kind of get out of something what you put into it. You can’t expect to get much from your job if you don’t put anything into except for the bare minimum.'",
        "In response to 'What if the effort is scaled back because of a lack of incentive to do anything beyond your job? As in you've been going above and beyond and gotten no reward for it so you just go down to the bare minimum?', a user said: 'Time to look for another job….'",
        "In response to 'All most people need out of their job is money, I’m not buying this response lol', a user said: 'Guess that depends what your goals are.'"
