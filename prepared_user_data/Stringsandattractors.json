        "In response to 'Seems like a fast track to spiraling into a meaningless, bleak life of nothingness. No sense of achievement or meaning at all.\nSums up Reddit really.', a user said: 'I feel similar. I’ve been promoted again and again not because of my skills on paper but my attitude.\nI won’t work anymore than my hours. I’m out that door at 5pm. However I see an employer as paying for my time. Maximising utility of my time has made my pay almost triple in six years.\nI won’t overwork and I won’t work extra hours but I’m not sitting doing nothing doing my work time jsut because ‘I’ve done all my job’. There’s always more to do. And that gets recognised.\nI feel if I had jsut done the bear minimum I’d still be sat just above minimum wage. Because honestly I feel like an imposter sometimes with my knowledge set.'"
