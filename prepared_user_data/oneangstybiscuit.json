Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Why didn't you call though? it seems like part of the job'",
        "In response to 'It's also part of the customers side of things to pay attention to the app.  Messages make a sound too.It pops up right on your phone.', a user said: 'You've never missed a text but a call caught your attention? You're right, they SHOULD be watching their phone more carefully, but still. No matter what job I've had, I've always been expected to exhaust all available options before abandoning a task. It's actually easier to call people than to text them, imo, so it wouldn't even be much more effort.'"
