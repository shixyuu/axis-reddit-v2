I agree it’s a terrible name for just caring more about yourself and life than your employer expects.  I have always chosen myself over a company.  Now I work for a non-profit who pays better than any for-profit I’ve ever worked for and they actually respect me and my time too!  I continue to hope everyone puts more focus on their life and less on the place they work, employers very rarely give a shit.'"
