        "In response to 'Has anyone here ever worked somewhere, had a supervisor quit, then had to do the supervisor's job, but while being told they can't actually make you officially the supervisor yet, just so they don't have to give you a pay rise? I've known several people who have had this happen to them, and they get strung along with the promise that\neventually\nthey will have the title and pay rise. No one should fall for it.\nEdit to avoid angry mods: Yes. I wholeheartedly support Silent Quitting and Acting Your Wage.', a user said: 'Had that some years ago. Supervisor brought the idea up though that I deserved a raise/promotion. I hadn't even considered it. Told me for months that she was putting in for it. I kept asking and being told it was in the works. Then one day she hires on her best friend to the position.\nWorst part was the chick was only there for two weeks before she decided the job just wasn't for her and left.'"
