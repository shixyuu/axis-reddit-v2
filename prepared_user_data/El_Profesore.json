        "In response to 'Had a similar experience, except I was taking the extra work for months. Asked for a raise, denied, quit.\nLong story short, my \"replacements\" botched things so fucking hard in the next 6 months, that the company brought me back as a freelancer, even after I asked for 12 times the amount of my previous salary. Spent over a year on these conditions until the mess got fixed.', a user said: 'That's awesome! 12 times dude, so you did in a month what you previously did in a year lol. Could you share a range, around how much was that? Sounds incredible\nMakes you think how much better we can do if we stand up for ourselves and change jobs more often'"
