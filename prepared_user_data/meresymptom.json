        "In response to 'Many older generations in the US still operate that working hard and going above what you are asked to do makes you look good. Bosses will give you more attention and thus a raise or better reviews. This culture is now used to control people.', a user said: 'I got hired as an operator in a chemical plant almost four decades ago. At the time it was a significant jump up for me in both pay and benefits. I was grateful for the opportunity and resolved to do my best for them. Over the years, pay and benefits began to lag, a series of new owners became increasingly loathsome, and decades of shift work began to take their toll. I should have given them a days work for a days wages and left it at that. In spite of what Mitt Romney says, corporations are not people. You do not owe them anything and should never allow yourself to feel grateful or beholden to them. They will gladly use you, abuse you, and throw you away.'"
