Whomever still uses this terminology is perpetuating a myth.', a user said: 'I’ve ghosted jobs before and it was always related to the amount of hours I’m given. I work my butt off and go above and beyond to only see that my schedule gets changed to less hours. We were always told that our record breaking, profit making company just doesn’t have enough money for payroll but then hire a bunch of part-time/seasonal employees. It seems like this is the norm yet price of living has been going up. The labor force isn’t gone, they’re just switching to new jobs with a higher pay'",
