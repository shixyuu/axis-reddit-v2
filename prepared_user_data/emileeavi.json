        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Well, besides the fact that this should be called \"not going above and beyond after your job proves time and time again they don't actually give a fuck about you so you now just do exactly what they hired you for\" I personally worked my ass off for a company, did all the manager duties for 3 months when my manager quit in my department, and then I was passed over the position for another girl becuase \"she has management experience\" which makes sense EXCEPT she was a front end manager who was vital and they gave her the position instead and kept just taking her to the front and leaving me in the department. I asked to move to a different department after that and didn't help them out anymore becuase they tried to take advantage of me (becuase in the past I let them becuase I loved the job)'"
