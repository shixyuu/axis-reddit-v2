It took over a year but now I’ve got it that we don’t fire drill Chase our tails with our hair on fire each time they have some never thought of ever brilliant idea that they’ll forget about. I ask them to submit a simple form. That’s it. Just fill it out with a summary, purpose, proposed ROI, and assign tasks. 100% of the time they’ll move on.'"
