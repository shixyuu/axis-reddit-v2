        "In response to 'This is a layoff. They want people to quit and workers falling for it again. They need to show up everyday and Make the company lay you off in a proper way', a user said: 'This is a layoff. They want people to quit and workers falling for it again.\nStupidly, these companies are falling for it themselves too. These veiled layoffs invariably leads to the competent people who have options walking out, and the desperate staying behind, clinging to the job they have and can not easily replace. That's a bit hyperbolic, but the gist of it.\nIt looks like a cheap way of doing layoffs, but instead you hone away your talent, depleting the company's talent pool.'"
