        "In response to 'I mean, when I lived in Japan \"work ethic\" meant you have to leave later than your boss. It didn't mean you had to do work, just look busy. That's basically the \"quiet quitting\" bullshit the media made up to shame people for doing their jobs, and my coworkers were doing that decades ago. It sounds like nothing's changed they just wrote a scolding article about it.', a user said: 'if you weren't a smoker or not good at casually slacking off you end up overworking yourself in the process.  The system sucks for everyone, but the ones that were harming themselves were probably the folks that would have been high performers at an office that valued work ethics instead of blind loyalty to your boss.'"
