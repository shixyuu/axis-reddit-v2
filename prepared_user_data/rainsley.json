        "In response to 'Original Post: I realized today, I quiet quit grocery shopping! So about a year ago I had a breakdown emotionally. Nothing really changed. I kept my terrible job. Our chores didn’t immediately change.\nBut I stopped cooking as often, so I didn’t have to dishes as often, didn’t have to clean up the kitchen as often. Kids still eat, less healthy than I like, but they love sandwiches and the random crappy frozen food, with a fruit and veg. I cooked less so I shopped somewhat less. Then I shopped less and less. And my husband was offering to grab what we needed more. So I just keep doing less.\nToday I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I did a big grocery haul. And today I found shrimp in my freezer. That my husband bought. That I didn’t ask for. Like oh cool I will plan something for this. \nMy mental health is somewhat better. Wondering what else I can quiet quit.', a user said: 'I did a version of this too!\nThe grocery store is soooo stressful. It's 4 blocks away though - so now husband or I drop by each day we want to make dinner and get just stuff for that meal. In and out in 10 minutes, no more than 8 items. I signed up for an egg CSA and a meat CSA and so that stuff is local, healthy, and delivered to my house. I like it better than the \"farm boxes\" that send you turnips every week the whole winter too.'"
