I never did put the current sticker on it and I don't think they've even noticed, since Texas has the sticker on the windshield.', a user said: 'It's so weird that it's on the windshield. It means a cop doesn't really have a fast way to know it's expired until they've already stopped you for something else. Other places with stickers on the back the cops use expired plates to initiate the stop then look for drugs or other stuff.'",
