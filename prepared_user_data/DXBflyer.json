        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'Why do these people on social media suddenly have an ancient idea, call it something new and just assume that it's not already been around for absolutely fucking years already? They really rate their intellect don't they.\nIn answer to your question, going above and beyond is for people who want promotion. Working to the hours and responsibilities you are paid for, is for everybody else. No matter what fad name they call it, it's not much harder than that really.'"
