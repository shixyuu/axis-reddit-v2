Turns out one of the extra duties that my team was shedding caused HR to say we were getting a ten percent reduction in pay. So we pointed out that there had been no ten percent increase with the additional duties so they in fact owed us about three years of back pay. They did not pursue it further and in fact clarified that \"extra duties\" had to be less than five percent of your work and not be ongoing.'"
