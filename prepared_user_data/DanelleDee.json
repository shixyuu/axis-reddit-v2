        "In response to 'In the uk we never had quite quitting and we already had ‘working to rule’ whereas no extras, not one second or not one extra duty was performed. This has crippled companies, especially those who rely on staff to preform regular overtime (including paid). Let’s face it, it’s not quitting if you do exactly what is written in your contract.', a user said: 'Yeah, it's funny. My company constantly pressures us for OT at a straight rate (it's legal in my industry), fights giving me days off, started hiring people at the wage I was earning after three years (I successfully argued a raise, but shouldn't have had to.) I do my job, screen their calls, and threaten to quit when needed.\nMy bf is salaried and got a 10% raise this year. When he has to work at ten pm, he gets bonuses. Weirdly, he is always willing to help out when they need him! Funny how that works.'"
