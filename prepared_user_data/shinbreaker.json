        "In response to 'I’ve known about this for a while, and thank you for the write up! I wanted a confirmation from a person I didn’t know personally.\nI think the lockdowns hurt China way more than any other country and it made things way way worse. It made a lot of the world divest from China. Making unemployment even worse than it was prior. I think the CCP expected a different outcome of the event, but got the rude awakening as of recently. The real estate bubble there is outrages, but definitely didn’t know they no longer employ older people in construction. Real Estate is like that in Hong Kong and Macau as well. The difference being that there the populations are smaller, so it’s not as noticing to the public. This is going to get spicy and if some of you have looked at the currency swaps of USD and YUAN it’ll make a lot more sense. Stack cash and wait, cause we are going to see a big drop in everything.', a user said: 'Anyone with any knowledge about the economy already knew that China wasn't doing well, but here's the rub: they don't go buy \"our\" rules. They're literally making shit up as they go because they can and no other country is going to call them out on it.\nAs long as other countries send them money, China is going to keep appearances up and make up numbers as they go along.'"
