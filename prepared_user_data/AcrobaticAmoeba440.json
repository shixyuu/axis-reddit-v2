        "In response to 'Dude you are already better than the Dashers around here. \nIt doesnt matter that I leave them the building entry code, they just ring me from the apartment carpark. I'm only on the 1st floor, basically a 15m walk through the building entry to my front door.\nThey never bring it to my door.\nThis sort of shit is another reason we, customers, need to be able to tip after the delivery. Can only add a review after delivery here, tip can only be made when you place your order', a user said: 'The day they add the tip after is the day I quit, im not taking every $2 base pay order just to \"hope\" for a tip.'",
        "In response to 'Fair enough too mate. It sounds like doordash are pretty shit to their own workforce.\nJust a question, I don't ever complain about the driver but when I do I'll say the restaurant fucked up my order or gave me the wrong item because I don't want to get the driver in any shit because he or she will probably be delivering my next meal and I don't want them to loose money.\nSo when I complain to Doordash and they give me a partial $8 refund does it come from the drivers pay ? Or from the restaurant? Or do Doordash just take the hit. ?', a user said: 'I believe doordash takes the hit'"
