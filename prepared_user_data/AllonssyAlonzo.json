        "In response to 'if i understand it correctly, its just working and doing what you agreed to. No more, no less. You clock in on time and do the things you agreed to in your contract and you leave on time. Thats it.', a user said: 'Alright, in that case, I quet quitting my shitty job on April.\nI've seen also people say we should do the least possible, which doesn't sound so cool IMO'",
        "In response to 'Just do what you agreed to. Simple as that. If they want more from you, they have to pay you more. Why would you work for free? And also why should you work your ass off at all? And for what? You just get more on your plate for the same pay. More work gets rewarded with more responsibilities and more work. Rarely you get more pay. Or the classic „alrighty, you work 55 hours instead of 39 now and get.. let me check.. 1.2 % more pay. Isn’t that great?!“ Yeah.. Fuck that noise', a user said: 'I totally agree on this, that's what happened to me with my with last employer'",
        "In response to 'From what i have seen the best course would be to get into a job, do normal work. After some time you ask for bonuses, not promotions. If you don’t get them, apply to the next jobs and haggle for higher pay due to working experience. I know that this is a theoretical situation. Reality looks different. But its way more likely to get screwed over by a raise than bonuses..', a user said: 'yeah, not easy for sure'"
