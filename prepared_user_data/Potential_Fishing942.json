        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Update: wow, the support!  Thank you all!\nWill now only refer to this as \"Just doing my job\"\nStarting today, I quit working for free.  I won't manage the school food pantry, sew for students or school programs ( uniform alterations, letter jackets, CTE jackets, prom dresses), work the gate or track meets, cover hall duty for others, support fundraisers, sponsor or coach teams, provide snacks to students, participate in staff potluck meals.\n I will arrive 2 minutes before my designated duty time and leave 2 minutes after hours.\nI will take off every Friday to help my family, and take off every PD because I have yet to attend a worthwhile PD (I have only been teaching since 2001, a valuable PD is unlikely to occur in the next year).\nI have 80+ days of leave accrued, and I will leave as few on the table as possible. \nThere is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.', a user said: 'I have slowly pulled back since we had 2 years of step increase freezes during covid.\nIt's incredible, but I'm not alone any more and it's definitely impacting the students. We had 30 clubs this year with no sponsor- some of them big \"anchor\" clubs too. I just feel those things should be paid for or we need to recognize teachers are not christ reincarnate and we simply have lives of our offer contract hours. School clubs would be best through a community center that is well staffed so people can focus on building communities'"
