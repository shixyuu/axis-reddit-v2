        "In response to 'Love it!\nDon't mess with the security guards either. I always knew every single fire code violation, who was skipping out of work early, who was sleeping at work, and who was having office affairs.\nMy mother used to say the two people who know all your secrets are your mailman and the janitor. I'd add security guard and maintenance tech to that list. Lol', a user said: 'My last job, i was a Custodial Technician in a factory. After i got my new job, i decided to finally get revenge for 4 years of being treated like dirt.\nMade a report to OSHA for all broken machine guards.\nMade a report to the Dept. of Labor, about their break policy and overtime policy.\nCasually mentioned to my neighbor, a Fire Marshal, about some broken emergency lights, and a couple of fire exits blocked by broken down trailers and forklifts...and may or may not have also mentioned the chronic hydraulic fluid leak behind the building.'"
