        "In response to 'Original Post: Saw this posted on LinkedIn: “Quiet Quitting” [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/g2rczsex4xh91.jpg', a user said: 'I have seen myself fall into a pattern with every new job.\nI start off and am quiet as I learn the ropes.  I ask questions so I can learn more about how it all works together.  I stay maybe a few minutes past because I generally don't know enough to do more but wanna look eager to help.\nLater on once I know enough I start getting involved and taking on more individual tasks.  Still stay only a few minutes after.\nThen I am very proficient with all these tasks and feel like I'm the only one who can accomplish the tasks properly.   I stay late to get things done and even come in early to set myself up for a good day.\nEventually something happens that reflects negatively on me (i.e. being late) and all my good work is ignored.\nFrom then on, I have no motivation to do extra.  I stay for my shift and I do enough to be considered an average employee.'"
