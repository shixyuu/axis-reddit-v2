        "In response to 'I do exactly my job, and I’ve called it “setting boundaries” my boss is like “can’t argue with that”! I guess I’m lucky.', a user said: 'I think that’s a better way to frame it. I generally don’t mind if a task takes me a few minutes over my hours because they don’t mind if I have to go to a dentist appointment or if my lunch takes longer than planned because the dog chased a squirrel on our walk and took a while to come back. It’s the pettiness I can’t be dealing with.\nUntil I reached a certain pay grade, I could claim all my overtime anyway since until you reach a certain level of seniority, you shouldn’t be expected to routinely go above and beyond. I feel like I’m now employed to fulfill a job description with responsibilities rather than just do a set bunch of hours. I can manage my time and negotiate work capacity effectively enough and have a good relationship with my manager should I need to discuss workload and expectations.'"
