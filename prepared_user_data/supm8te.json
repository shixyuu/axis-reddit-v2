Basically had a target on my back because made more than the kids they hired who had less than 1 year exp in field(I'm near 8). Finally made a mistake- didn't cost company any money but gave them what they needed to fire me for cause and state unemployment sided with them. Worked literally from start of covid til a month ago. For half that time it was just myself and 2 others covering the whole state in a 3 territory system we built and created. I received 1 raise after having a better offer and having to threaten to leave if I did not receive a raise after year 1. 2nd year I was promised a raise, 3 months later denied the raise and then fired 5 months later. I was told by the new executive that I have \"potential\". The guy is literally running the dept my other 2 coworkers and I built and forced all 3 of us out. The only ppl left are family friends of new executive and child of a Manager. Fuck all of it, because this is some bullshit. But hey, already got 2 written offers that pay more and a 3rd I'm hoping to get offer for that pays even more. So it could be worse. But for about a month, I was stressing out, and interviewing while not even receiving unemployment. None of these companies are loyal and have no problem fucking over their experienced employees so Idgaf if employees want to do bare minimum anymore.'"
