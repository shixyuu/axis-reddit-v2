        "In response to 'Original Post: How is performing your job duties “quiet quitting?” Are you penalized for your efficiency & preventing burnout? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/02qwb6ziqvi91.jpg', a user said: '“Quiet quitting” seems like a phrase created around a corporate meeting table at a company like Amazon to keep employees from unionizing and encouraging a mass-walkout. Better to lose only one employee, “quiet quit”, than spread job discontentment throughout the ranks.\nThey can afford to lose a few single employees here and there. Might as well put up a poster in the break room that says “Thinking of quitting? Keep it to yourself!”\nIt’s super sus that this phrase has just all of a sudden been all over the media lately as if it were corporately publicized. I’ve never heard one person use this phrase.'"
