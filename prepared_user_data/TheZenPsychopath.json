        "In response to 'I never understood this.\nScenario A:\nYou pay me a fixed hour wage, that is independent of my work output, which creates a culture where you try and maximize my output, and minimize my wage/hours.  I try and maximize my hours, while minimizing my labor.\nScenario B:\nYou pay me a base stipend that covers my cost of living, and include ALL employees as members of the company.  My work, and my coworkers work, directly benefits us in a tangible financial way.\nWhy would system two not be the better system for actually getting quality work done?  Now I know that my labor is directly benefiting those around me who I interact with on a daily basis, and large scale social pressure would encourage people to work harder, with the desire to earn more.  This would lead to increased work flow, more productivity, and ultimately happier employees.\nIf you say this though, your a communist.  Americans claim to believe in democracy, but not in the workplace, where for some reason we praise dictatorships.', a user said: 'Because the same people who squeeze every hour and \"maximize efficiency\" would be the ones deciding what the base cost of living is.'"
