        "In response to 'I read something (probably on Reddit, lol) that used the phrase \"work your wage\" in place of quiet quitting. I think it's a more accurate way of viewing this movement.\nI'm not quitting at all. I am doing what I need to do for my students in my classroom, and on the playground every day. I still enjoy teaching, my kids are good, I have good support from admin, lots of positives. But, I'm exhausted and used up by the end of each day. When I go home, I'm at home, and school no longer comes with me.\nNo more going in on weekends to tidy up and prep, if it doesn't get done on Friday by 4, then it will wait. Does it even need to be done? My bulletin boards have never been Instagram ready, they definitely aren't now. Who cares, really?\nNo replies to email after 4pm, until 8am the next school day. No replies ever on weekends. No parents have my cell number, never have. If they were to get it somehow, they will be ignored and blocked.\nNot interested in running a lunch time craft club. Not interested in running after-school sports. I don't feel great about this part - I was involved in more than a few drama and musical productions that depended on after school rehearsals when I was in school, those experiences have me purpose and a group I belonged to, and I remember those days (and those teachers) fondly. I remember feeling grateful, not entitled, and I think that's where the difference lies today.\nGood for your teachers. Maybe this will make admin a little more appreciative of the staff.', a user said: 'It is kind of wild how so many people were tricked or sort of course into working extra hours like it was part of the job. I Did It For My First 3 years because I wanted to not do it for the next 20, lol. I worked my ass off to set up my lesson plans and that way I can leave and leave work at work.'"
