        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is clever marketing spin for just doing your job. That's it. Doing the tasks that you agreed to do at the pay scale you agreed to do it at, no more and no less.', a user said: 'Yeah, agree.  Corps like to give you a job description, salary, then force you above and beyond the call of duty using intimidation tactics.  Don't  fall for it.  Do what they claimed the job is.  Let them fire you.  Go to a lawyer.\nCorps are at war with the labour force right now.  They can't get workers, and they're damned if they'll pay more money or change the job to get them.  They're lobbying for more cheap, exploitable immigrants to fill the positions.'"
