        "In response to 'Original Post: there's no such thing as \"quiet quitting\" People simply don't want to do any more than what they are paid and expected to do anymore because wages aren't keeping up with prices and income inequality is at an all time high.\nCEOs are getting richer while workers are getting poorer. With inflation our jobs cannot afford us a decent life anymore. Also if I'm not being paid for my efforts, why should I put in more effort? If I'm not getting paid for my work, I'm going to do minimum work. If I get paid for my work, I'll be more productive. Pay employees more and give them a better chunk of the profit instead of it going to the top and people will work harder', a user said: '100% correct. All \"quiet quitting\" means is a marketing term used to demonize not being willing to sacrifice your time and well-being for a job who's sole goal is to exploit the living fuck out of you. No one buys the mentality of \" I believe in my work so much,  I'm willing to kill myself even though I can't support myself.\" You might find some who are willing to do so for the arts, but sure as hell not for the average starter office/factory job. \"Quiet quitting\" is code for \"we cant exploit you!!\" Lets call this bullshit out!'"
