        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'From my experience, Quiet Quitting has been happening for years. A lot of colleagues have told me that whether they do more, or they do bare minimum, they still get same salary. So do bare minimum for optimal Effort to Money ratio.\nI do think that going hard and pushing is not for everyone. It takes a toll on you, physically or mentally (sometimes both!). Often, we don't realise the cost of this behaviour until it's too late.\nYou have to pay the cost of hustling for money/position/success, you just have to decide if it's worth your while.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'It depends? The bare minimum, in many cases, involves shirking some form of work that is within the job scope, because someone else picked the slack up. Which means, of cause, that in these cases, there's unpaid labour happening.\nQuietly Quitting might be a sign of the times, but I sure hope my colleagues don't take it up, for their sake and mine.'"
