        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'It's almost like someone in the corporate realm thought that by coining this term, it would somehow shame (?) people into doing more than they are compensated for?\nIt's the rich & wealthy who are just being pro-active, working to make anyone who refuses to put \"the company\" before themselves, who refuse to be exploited any longer, to make them look bad.  This is just the new \"job creators\" buzzphrase, a way to counter inequality, much like that BS statement, \"no one wants to work anymore\".\nPeople became aware of this new facet of inequality, that working hard, going above and beyond no longer rewards those who do and the rich and powerful are trying to nip this in the bud. One way of doing this is to use BS shaming, to make people look bad, as in \"you lazy bum, you just don't want to work\".\nThere was a time when industrious & dedicated people were rewarded for their efforts but this is no longer the case, much like people being properly compensated for their work. Some people are finally waking up to this and this scares the upper crust. They managed to snuff out the last stirring of the masses back in 2008 and they don't want a repeat.'"
