        "In response to 'I worked at a Walgreens.  At first I busted my ass because I wanted more hours, then when I had the hours I kept busting my ass because I took pride in my work making the store successful.\nOne day, there was an all-hands meeting for all non-pharmacy staff.  Management gave what they thought was a motivating speech.  Thing is, in that speech, they included the fact that on a good month, the store was costing the company about $15k more than the store brought in.\nAfter that, the only times I busted my ass were for the regulars that I was on a first-name basis with, and the other customers that treated me like a human being.  Otherwise, it was only what was required', a user said: 'What was your reasoning based on the speech? Not picking at you just curious where your head was at. Was it like, “oh geeze I do all this work and we lose money? Not worth it.”'",
        "In response to '3 years ago. Covid broke me', a user said: 'Yup same.'"
