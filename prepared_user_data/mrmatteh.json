        "In response to 'Bruh, how is doing your job a form of protest? That's like high-school students protesting by going to school everyday and doing their homework but not doing any extra credit.', a user said: 'It's not \"just doing your job.\" Its doing your job\nexactly\nas the handbook says:\nIf the handbook says you shouldn't lift anything heavier than 50 pounds without assistance, then you weigh everything to make sure it's not over 50 pounds. And if it is, you leave it - that stuff can wait until someone else has free time to help. Unfortunately, everyone's too busy weighing things, so that might be a while\nIf your job description doesn't include answering the phone, you don't pick it up no matter how much it rings.\nIf the handbook says employees should get up and stretch their legs every couple hours, you and all your coworkers take a little walk at the exact same time since you're all on the same schedule.\nIt's essentially malicious compliance'"
