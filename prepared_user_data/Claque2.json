Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'Quiet firing is the one employers use. It involves PIPs and write ups that are vague and silly. They believe they will get some eager college grad who will get an entry level wage with a few benefits, and settle for a 3% increase after a year, for each and every year.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: How is performing your job duties “quiet quitting?” Are you penalized for your efficiency & preventing burnout? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/02qwb6ziqvi91.jpg', a user said: 'It's time to talk about the Quiet Neglect and Abuse of employees by employers that has been going on for at least the past 20 years.\nInsurance premiums with double digit increases every year while payroll raises were stagnated at between 1 and 3 percent standard.\nNo reward for loyalty. No reward for experience and training. A brilliant job done is met with a bag of pennies as a reward and a 'meets expectations.'\nQuiet Neglect and Abuse.'"
