        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is a phrase made up by disgruntled employers who can't figure out how to get their employees to go \"above and beyond\", while still paying them like shit and never promoting them. It is an out-of-touch phrase that is trying to shame employees into giving more while getting less.\nYou should do your job. That's it. Every now and then, if you are feeling nice, you could help someone else out or take on a bigger project, but it should always be employee-led and with the understanding that most companies will never compensate you for it. Company loyalty went out the window with pensions. These days, you are lucky if your company doesn't fire you because suddenly you are breaking the bank account because you have worked there 10 years and got a 2% raise each year...except last year when no one got a raise but they remodeled the break room and added a couch. (no one=everyone but the boss, because of course they got a raise)\nIf company's want people to work 60 hours a week...then you better as hell be paying the wages of a 60 hour work week. If a manager wants their employees to have full open availability throughout the week, then you need to be sure those employees don't need a 2nd or 3rd job to pay their bills.'"
