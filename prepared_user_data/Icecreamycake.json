This person is just not doing their job. There is a difference.'",
        "In response to 'They're not doing their job?\nSounds like this employee's hand was sadly forced by the new-age phenomenon of \"quiet firing\" wherein employers will continue to take work from an employee, without any desire to give them anything on top of what was agreed on.', a user said: 'They aren't reading their emails. That's part of your job.\nBut that's not my issue. My issue is that OP thinks that's \"quite quitting\", which isn't a thing, is what their co worker is doing. But that's not real.\nIt's a term made up by corporations to make us feel bad that we aren't doing more, but we don't need to do more. We need to do what we were hired to do and that's all.\nClock in, do ur work, clock out leave. Nothing more, nothing less.'"
