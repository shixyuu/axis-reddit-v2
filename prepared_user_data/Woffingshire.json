        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It's not quitting at all. It's not even doing the bare minimum. It's doing what your job is. That's all it is.\nThe entire concept is that if you don't get paid more or treated better for doing tasks it's not your job to do, do not do them.\nEmployers are so pissed they can't exploit their workers anymore that they're deeming it a form of quitting.'"
