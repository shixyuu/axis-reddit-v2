        "In response to 'Men can face discrimination for actively asserting work life balance.\nI was fired from a large Uranium mining/refining firm in Saskatchewan for taking Parental Leave when my son was born.\nInitially, I informed them 6 weeks in advance that I’d be taking the leave. The employer denied my leave. It was against company policy. I asserted that it was a federally protected right in Canada. They permitted my leave but in my second shift after my return they fired me - no reason given.\nThe company then turned a collections company on me to recoup the money the employer spent to relocate me family from another province. I politely provided them the documents the company gave me and told them to fuck off.\nDear Cameco, you’re a bunch of assholes.', a user said: 'Pretextual firing, generally an at-will termination after protected activity is presumed to be retaliation.'",
        "In response to 'I work in a machine shop. I've had some of the old guys(been there longer than I've been alive) try to give me a little crap in a non aggressive way about clocking in and out exactly when I'm scheduled to. If im not working OT, its 7-5:30 EXACTLY.', a user said: 'If you clock in earlier or out later, you’re getting paid for the overtime you’re working.\nClocking in before you start work and out after you finish is normal.'"
