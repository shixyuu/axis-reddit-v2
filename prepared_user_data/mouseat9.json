        "In response to 'We call it \"work to the rule\" where I am because we can't strike. So when we want to \"strike\" this is what our organizations tell us to do. Walk out that door when contract hours are over and if shit doesn't get done, it doesn't get done.\nThe problem is, not doing that shit just stresses the teacher out and no one else because now she's constantly playing catchup and can't walk into, for example, an IEP meeting unprepared so....', a user said: 'Yes but then it goes back to the toxic overworked standard.'",
        "In response to 'US teacher, 2nd year (probably my last) and I'm doing this. If admin doesn't like it, as the fucking\nleaders of our school and get paid really well for the big ideas\nthey need to unpack the situation they put me in and brainstorm ideas to help me, help them. They can grab as many data points as they want, start committees, and have teacher of the weeks all they want, but it all points to one thing: fuck you, pay us, reduce classroom sizes, if not, provide every teacher with an aide that just deals with the paperwork.\nAlso, bargain in good faith. Stop jerking us all around.', a user said: 'Wooooooo.   Helll yeah!!!!!'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting could be the best thing for education. Everyone's definition of quiet quitting is different. Mine is not working outside of your contract ours. Work from 7am to 3pm and then you're done. No lesson planning outside of class, no chaperoning, no working gates unless it involves extra pay.\nWhen you ignore these boundaries, you overwork yourself, can't sustain the position, and you end up leaving the profession and in return your students lose a great educator.\nIf you can't do all the tasks a school asks for you to do during the day, that is not the fault of you, it is the fault of your boss requiring too much of you. If you continue doing these tasks outside of your hours you are effectively telling your admin that this is okay.\nWhen you put your value in working extra hours because it makes you feel like you are \"doing it for the kids\" you are doing the opposite long term. The precedent that teachers have to put so much time in outside of work is toxic and leads to teacher burnout. A shortage of teachers is not good for any educational system.\nI'd like to blame admin, government, or students but the easiest fix is in the teachers themselves. When we overwork ourselves, we effectively hurt education. Only work your hours and if you can't get your work done, let your admin know you don't have the time. Healthy work life balance can keep us going and bring more teachers into the profession.\nEdit: Sorry y'all. I didn't realize how problematic the term \"quiet quitting\" is. I am glad though that it brought some attention to the post which led to some good discussion. I will use a different term from here on out and I am happy a lot of you only work your hours or work your contract.', a user said: 'Amen'"
