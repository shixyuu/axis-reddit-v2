        "In response to 'I think Biden completely let his ego and emotions get in the way, but I don't think the Biden loyalists are actually a powerful force. They're loud on X, but he was so overwhelmingly unpopular - I don't think the betrayal line would have stuck.', a user said: 'There seems to be such a hesitation for this criticism too. I reluctantly voted for Biden in 2020 bc I didn't want Trump in office again. Then he only stepped down bc he caved from party pressure. Meanwhile he was going to keep pushing ahead with beyond abysmal polling. It's wild. I don't think he's this savior of democracy or a class act. I'm glad he has respect for norms but he never should have ran for a 2nd term.'"
