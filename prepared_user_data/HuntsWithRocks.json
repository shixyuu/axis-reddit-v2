        "In response to 'I paid £2 for 100g of chocolate, and when it arrived it was only 100g of chocolate! This is an outrage! How dare they give me the bare minimum required? Where's my 110%? Where's the coffee? Everyone knows that coffee goes well with chocolate, it should be a given that you provide me with coffee when I buy chocolate! They gave me free coffee before, and the other company used to provide crisps for free as well before they went bust. Nobody wants to sell snacks anymore!', a user said: 'Also, the guy delivering it didn’t seem as enthused as I would have liked. It really irks me. I know, I only bought the chocolate, but I would’ve appreciated a little dance or maybe sing a song or something. Nothing… they just handed to me like an asshole.'"
