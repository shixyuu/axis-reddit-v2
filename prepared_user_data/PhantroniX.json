        "In response to 'Wage compression:\nWhen companies offer higher starting salaries to attract new talent without adjusting the pay of current employees\nBasically, the minimum wage jumped in my state, and now they need to offer higher pay to attract new employees, but they didn't adjust the scale for existing workers. I started at this job making $12/hr, which was $3 over minimum wage at the time, and now, after 9 years, I'm making $19/hr - which looks good on paper, except the state minimum wage is now $16/hr, so I'm still making $3 over minimum wage.\nThe worst part is that I'm expected to train kids walking in the door, making as much or more than me, who were in middle school when I started here.', a user said: 'My job has been doing this too, and I never knew there was a term for it. I've gotten raises every year, but the ad I found listed my exact position for $3/hr more than me, and now suddenly I have a new guy I've gotta train.\nThe worst part is they will deny me a substantial raise, and if I quit, they'll give the new guy with 0 knowledge more than the wage I was even asking for. Make it make sense.'"
