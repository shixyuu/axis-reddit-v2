        "In response to 'Original Post: What happened with quiet quitting? I'm definitively going to start quiet quitting this next month. I'm not proud to work at my current company (quite the opposite) and my boss thinks he's paying to make me his slave.\nBut I was looking for tips on how to start quiet quitting here on Reddit and I could only find old posts. It seems like it's not a thing anymore. Is quiet quitting dead? What have I missed?', a user said: 'Guess I am quiet quitting. \nWas 2 people in my company of 1500+ that did this particular role/function that is required for regulatory reasons. Other person resigned leaving just me, was told that they would hire for that role - then be told a month later that its not happening.\nSo now as I am the only one with this knowledge/role and basically no one else knows what I do - its been pretty quiet…. Major projects closed out as don’t have capacity - at least we have LinkedIn Learning provided.\nCompany is useless enough to not cover a role they deserve what they get (but have no idea what they dont know)'"
