Your employer pays you to provide a service or produce a product, and they sell that product or service for more than what they paid you, which is how they generate a profit. Your employer would\nnever\npay you what you're worth because they don't benefit from that relationship'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Had a fight with my parents over this “quiet quitting” trend. Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy. I can’t seem to make them see the reality. When they were young and working you could leave work behind by walking out of a building, not so anymore.\narticle', a user said: 'That's not quitting. I don't do work when I'm not on the clock, and answering the phone and emails 100% counts as work'"
