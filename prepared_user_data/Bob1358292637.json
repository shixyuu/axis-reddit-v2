        "In response to 'What wonderful research. I’m deeply grateful and relieved to see people are aware of the impact of emotional labor and are not only researching it, but also suggesting it may be better for employers to NOT ask employees to be cheerful constantly', a user said: 'It does feel good but it’s also disappointing that it’s done in the scope of, “this is bad because you get less work out of them”.  It’s sort of missing the point that being happy is something we should just want for the population instead of it being a tool to drive production.\nKind of feels like the whole, “we don’t abuse our cows because that makes their meat taste worse”, thing.  Like, it’s good that it’s a thing I guess but the end result is still pointlessly horrible for them because there’s no incentive to treat them humanely beyond how it will benefit the people exploiting them.'"
