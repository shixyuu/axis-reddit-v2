The shift is probably people just outright saying it.', a user said: 'I mean, when your population is mostly a bunch of 40+/50+ years old or just seniors who can no longer be worked to death like they used to.\nYou can't really keep doing the same thing, and believe it will succeed.\nJapan/Nippon inevitably has to break down and reform a lot of social and economic rules, even if it is too late.\nUnless they just want to make another country altogether, maybe province of China/US?\nNeo Taiwan? Alliance? Zeon? New Japan? Imperial Japa...we don't go there please.\nWhatever it will be, I pray it won't be another religious/weird cult about supremacy/chosen people/anything similar to people who dream of total spread of an ideology that you can not escape from.'"
