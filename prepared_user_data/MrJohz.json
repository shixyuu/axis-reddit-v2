        "In response to 'I get the impression that quiet quitting is more about doing the minimum to “appear” to be working, rather than doing the minimum required by contract. If my staff do the minimum required by contract, have a happy balanced life, then great - very happy with that.', a user said: 'Yeah, my impression of quiet quitting was that it was relatively little to do with contracts, and more about maintaining the appearance of work while putting in as little effort required as possible.  Basically riding the line between \"bad employee\" and \"sackable employee\".  But then I've only ever worked in places where it was very rare to work beyond the contract, so it may be that that's colouring my impression of what quiet quitting means for others.'"
