[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'The first times I encountered the term, it was referring to people whose performance shifted to just the bare minimum. It was a precursor to them either actually quitting or looking to be let go. It since morphed to cover “work to rule”.\nI’ve also seen it used as a sort of challenge to management. Essentially saying, “I’m doing the job I’m paid to do. If you admonish/punish me for not doing extra you’re going receive a rude awakening.”\nAs businesses have shown less and less loyalty to staff, the staff have started to wise up.'"
