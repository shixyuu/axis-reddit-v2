        "In response to 'The youngs at work have made it EXTREMELY clear that they don't care about anybody's input if you're over 40. We are the enemy as far as they are concerned. Fine, make stupid, expensive mistakes because you don't want to listen to the olds tell about the four other times we tried the same thing. Don't care anymore, I guess they they can figure it out for themselves. Or not. Whatever.', a user said: 'Yeah my 20-something coworker has made it clear in no uncertain terms that she thinks both me and my boss are dumb and out-of-touch. She said she’s a new grad, up on the latest and greatest, and “fresh”. In fact, she’s not fond of most of the workplace (it skews older) and has called some people lazy. I watched her argue for 20 minutes the other day with a seasoned, highly-educated staff member in a higher-up management position as to why she was right about something.'",
        "In response to 'Sounds like my work. Except the youngs include the boss, so of course she keeps hiring ones like her. They roam the hallways loudly talking about how the \"old people just can't learn new programs\". So not only are we old and stupid , we're also not high enough up in the pecking order for them to even pretend to listen. It was a lovely place to work until the new regime/youngs took over.', a user said: 'Fortunately there are very few youngs in my department. The only other one I can think of is learning quickly to keep her mouth shut and does her college schoolwork during downtime. She also seeks out advice and wisdom from us olds. I’m hoping the aggressive youngster gets a clue eventually and pipes down.'"
