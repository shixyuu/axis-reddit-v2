        "In response to 'Going home on time and not staying until your boss leaves is a no-no. Taking holiday is also a no-no. In fact, a guy actually made the news\nbecause\nhe took his holiday... And not going to the pub with your boss/colleagues after already staying after-hours is also a no-no.\nIt's really, really bad, especially for native Japanese. These same rules don't always apply to foreign workers, though.', a user said: 'They need to stand up to that nonsense and say \"heck no!\"(the Japanese equivalent).  That is slavery by peer pressure.'",
        "In response to 'Lol. Manager's are \"uneasy\" because they don't know who's genuinely working and who's just biding their time before they quit? Good. Be scared.\nUntil ya'll get your shit together and start matching our wages with the cost of living or inflation, this is what you're gonna keep getting. No one is loyal to your company. They're loyal to the family at home that needs food on their table.', a user said: 'True loyalty deserves true loyalty.  Most employers are not truly loyal to their employees, yet expect true loyalty from them.  They try to fake loyalty and call employees \"associates\" or \"family\", but nobody is fooled.  It is rather insulting, really.'"
