        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'For honest and kind hearted  JWs:\nStop donating with your hard earned money as well.\nWatchtower will survive for a long time even without your donation. They have investments like stocks, bonds, real estate properties. As you can see they have hundreds of millions of projects after projects around the globe. They use free labors and benefits from tax exemptions which they leverage for more profits when they sell these properties that they developed.'"
