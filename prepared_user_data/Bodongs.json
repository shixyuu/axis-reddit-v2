        "In response to 'are you meeting your goals\nAlso your goals are nebulous bullshit related to our overall company/division success, not actual tangible goals related to your job specifically', a user said: 'Ding ding ding. This is why I had to get out of tech sales after almost a decade. No matter how well you do, no matter how hard you work, some board member somewhere is going to look at your success and decide that means the goals weren't high enough and you made too much commission, so then you spend a few quarters at unreasonable goals and they put you on a PIP cuz you never stood a chance at hitting these numbers to begin with. Then they point to the Silicon Valley sales reps who wake up at 12 pm to respond to the blue birds that flew in their window while they make money hand over foot doing absolutely no day to day work.'",
        "In response to 'This is almost everywhere though. Oh you produced 10 products / day ?? Let’s aim for 15. Oh you made 15?? Let’s do 20!! Wait you averaged about 18 / day?? Why are you slacking ??', a user said: 'Yes infinite YoY growth is a cancer that will strip us of our free time and sanity with absolutely no upside for the worker.'"
