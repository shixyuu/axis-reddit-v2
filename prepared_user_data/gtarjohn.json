        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: 'No quiet quitting here.  When my last salaried ðŸ™‚ backpack sure watching and what is this kid doing your thing tomorrow near Richmond Road all that stuff itâ€™s off of Richmond Road man of war we may be in the same. What time do you go on Thursday at 1 oâ€™clock on Thursday? It was good. I was able to eat it. I got the power bowl which is more soft you know no tacos itâ€™s just rice and beans and Iâ€™m not trying to get this girl in Florida. She was a screwball yeah donâ€™t go well that is kind of freaky. I think Taco Bell can understand why maybe you need to get gas because Friday I have a mammogram at hospital or you can give me gas tomorrow you know as long as I have it by Thursday job working for a defense contractor became too stressful, I flat out quit!  The following Monday I started my new job across the street.  Now Iâ€™m the PCO on the multibillion follar contract this same company is performing on.'"
