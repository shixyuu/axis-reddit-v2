        "In response to 'Original Post: Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing. They just called it “mailing it in” and the movie Office Space is a commentary on this.', a user said: 'What are you talking about? When did the collective Gen X jump down your throat for doing only what you're paid to do? I wasn't screaming at you from those headlines. That's the powers that be trying to do your thinking for you again.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: \"quiet quitting\" is apparently a trend now Basically means you do what you were hired to do and nothing more. The \"bare minimum\" as it were. Gen Z adopted the term and its a tik tok thing now.\nI always thought it was called \"not being taken advantage of\"', a user said: 'It isn't quiet quitting if the minimum was all they did. I think the term would be more appropriate for those that pull back after going above and beyond with no recognition. They're likely looking for another job, and who could blame them?'"
