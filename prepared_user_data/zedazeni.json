        "In response to 'This is painfully common. My employer has been steadily cutting staff since covid with no end in sight for the expected 10% profit increase by year. Now sales are drastically falling due to a lack of customer service (which is our main selling point, mind you) and everyone is scratching their heads saying \"are you meeting your goals? If not, find out why, fix it, and report back to us üôÉ\"', a user said: 'I was in this situation with my previous job (I was in management at a Seattle-based coffee company). My store was the busiest non-drive thru in my district. Customers would always complain about how dirty the store was, about wait times, angry/grumpy employees, etc‚Ä¶I remember a Teams meeting where another SM (store manager) was venting to our DM (district manager) over how overworked and stressed their employees are, and many of them have two jobs because they don‚Äôt make enough working 30+ hours at this job. That SM said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre giving their 110%‚Äù to which the DM replied ‚Äúthen that‚Äôs not good enough!‚Äù\nA few months later, the DM visits my store during the morning rush. DM puts themself on the floor doing a super easy role (‚Äúwarming‚Äù wherein you put the food in an oven and wait for it to warm up to then serve to the customer. This is done for pastries and sandwiches). The DM‚Äôs usual ostentatiously chipper attitude dropped within around 5 min of working, and after about 10 the DM actually yelled at a customer who was complaining about the wait time for food that the DM was working on. DM can‚Äôt even do for 10 min what they expect us to do for 5+ hours a day with 75% less pay.\nTo top this, customers always provide their feedback via the app (if they use the app to pay). The responses are nearly universal in ‚Äúwait times are too long,‚Äù ‚Äútoo few employees,‚Äù ‚Äúthis store is too busy for how few people there are,‚Äù ‚Äúdirtiest store I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù etc‚Ä¶of course the DM doesn‚Äôt see this as an issue of being understaffed, rather that the staff are lazy and not following the proper routines.\nSuffice to say I found employment elsewhere.'",
        "In response to 'Way back in the 1900's, my first tech job. Management/HR was angry at how long our calls were taking. So they decided to setup a listening station for them to randomly connect to our calls and listen to what was taking so much time.\nThey admitted to only being able to listen for about 5 minutes because of how detailed/involved everything is, and how boring it was. Management being brought in from outside with zero understanding of what goes into the job tends to hamstring any department in any industry. How things work on paper; how things \"should,\" work? Fall apart as soon as your average human customer gets involved, and that's when it all goes to hell, rapidly.', a user said: 'Exactly. They design routines, systems, and time out tasks based on what‚Äôs theoretically possible in an ideal situation, plus maybe 5% extra time if something unexpected happens. What they account for is, well, the public. Someone broke a glass jar in the middle of the aisle, someone is shouting profanity and threatening violence in the middle of the store, an old person is taking 10 minutes to order at the register, a young child is grabbing things off the shelf and leaving them god-knows-where‚Ä¶.yeah that‚Äôs not being accounted for.'",
        "In response to 'To compound that exact point - \"Someone broke a glass jar in the middle of the aisle.\"\nThe routine should be \"Employee X goes into the aisle with the correct equipment to handle said glass and contents.\" But when in reality it's \"customer reported something on the floor,\" with zero indication of what's really happening, someone has to go, check it out, verify, then either contact someone else to get the equipment, or go back and get it themselves, and then get to work, assuming *another* customer isn't getting in the way the entire time.\nYeah. It's super frustrating.', a user said: 'For me it‚Äôs usually ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a broken glass jar of X by Y‚Äù then I walk my happy self over there and see it‚Äôs been smeared all up and down the aisle and another coworker misplaced the broom and dustpan and I gotta spend 15 min trying to locate it.'",
        "In response to 'Look, on paper, it takes one person exactly 6 minutes and 38 seconds to sweep the floor the size of a store, an empty floor, with no customers, and a perfect (simulated) amount of debris tossed about.\nI don't understand why a real employee can't do that in a crowded store after an exhausing lunch rush, while dealing with debris thats been grounded in by people walking on it etc.\n-- Corporate Execs.', a user said: 'Pretty much. Corporate has specific ‚Äútesting stores‚Äù that they use to test new employee routines, tech, etc‚Ä¶'",
        "In response to 'combative different fretful scale advise frightening ruthless grandfather touch fine\nThis post was mass deleted and anonymized with\nRedact', a user said: 'I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that. I think the bigger problem is that the reward structure is so misplaced that the wrong people are getting rewarded for the profits of the business.\nIn most retail places, store managers and district managers get quarterly bonuses for hitting sales goals, and even labor goals. Problem is, store managers aren‚Äôt the ones running the floor/stores, the Assistant Store Managers and Shift Supervisors/Leads are the ones running the shifts, managing personnel, handling customers, giving immediate coaching, and often training new hires. SMs are typically there only for staffing (hiring, firing, and scheduling) and payroll. They get the rewards for doing almost none of the work. Quarterly bonuses should be going to ASMs, SLs, SSVs, etc‚Ä¶and other mid-level management, not store managers and not district managers.'"
