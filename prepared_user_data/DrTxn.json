        "In response to 'It means a cop doesn't really have a fast way to know it's expired until they've already stopped you for something else.\nAutomated License Plate Readers kind of changed this, though.', a user said: 'My understanding is the main reason for these is to track plates down that have done something really bad not for things like sticker enforcement. Obviously it could become a revenue generator but if someone shoots someone and speeds off if they go past one of these points, they instantly are flagged. There is upside and downside.'",
        "In response to 'I think you are right. Was talking to a storm trooper in my parking lot. He was letting a lot of people speed by then plate reader went off and he said wanted child molester and fuck went and got that guy. I said go get em or something', a user said: 'I think at one point the city turned them off over privacy issues and they fought to keep them on since they are really fast at finding people like that really fast and they are very cost effective. On the one hand, they can basically tell where everyone is and who doesn’t have a sticker on the other hand it tags any stolen car or person who has been identified as driving a car so they can actually do the thing most people want them doing which is actually tracking down really bad people. Privacy versus safety… the age old argument'"
