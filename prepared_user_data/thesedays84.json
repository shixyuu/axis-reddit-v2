They put too much on your plate that it's impossible to do during your regular shit, and complain if you don't get it down with firing you, and the only way to complete it is to work free OT. It's bullying and intimidation.\nWhy is there not a more equal distribution of income?

I’ve been called in multiple times in the middle of the night to deal with refrigeration issues. In one particular instance, I went in three times overnight to deal with an issue. When I brought it up to my district manager, he said I should have delegated more and had zero sympathy for the fact that I’d already worked on my “off day” because that’s what they he pays a bonus for.\nWhen bonus time came around, my payout with basically pennies on what I actually worked.'"
