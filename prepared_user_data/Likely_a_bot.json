        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone else's departments like completely falling apart due to people quitting / quiet quitting? We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: 'No such thing as quiet quitting. Doing your job and going home isn't quitting. I like the good old days when we just labeled the people who brown-nosed or sucked up to the boss.\nStop trying to make \"quiet quitting\" a thing. That's sooo Reddit.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: ‘This has to stop’: A young man on TikTok says he and his wife make $120K/year — but can only afford this run-down house. Why Gen Z, millennials are using 'quiet quitting' to cope [External Link]: https://moneywise.com/real-estate/real-estate/young-man-quiet-quitting-cope', a user said: 'There are millions of people who own a house and a newer car that are completely oblivious to what's going on out there. Many are shocked beyond belief when life happens and they find themselves looking at having to buy a house or a car.\nMany people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nA mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.'",
        "In response to 'My car got totalled last year and insurance gave me 10% more than I paid after taxes in 2020. We looked at cars but I couldn't stomach spending so much on a car when I work from home and haven't missed driving.', a user said: 'The thing is that if you were replacing a luxury car, it would have been business as usual. But a Kia SUV is $70k. It's not a luxury vehicle. Luxury vehicles at the same price are in a whole other level options and quality-wise.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Those prices don't include dealer adjustments and add-ons. Prices are coming down for Kia and Hyundai vehicles, but Stellantis and Ford are still the worst examples currently.\nOn average a Jeep Grand Cherokee will cost on par with a similar-sized Lexus, Mercedes and Audi.\nOne example'",
        "In response to 'Your last sentence is exactly what people were telling us in 2017 when we bought. Back then we paid $25k over asking (and appraisal) and had to waive inspection and appraisal contingency. We won the house over like a dozen other offers. People were calling us idiots and zaying that the buying frenzy would subside and we'd have buyers remorse. Well...6 years later and it's done nothing but get worse. This honestly seems to just be what buying a house is. Long gone are the days of a family viewing some houses and picking their favorite to buy. Competition is fierce. You need lots of cash and to take on risk. It sucks, but I don't think it will ever get better.', a user said: 'Your situation was definitely local. I sold in 2019 in an area where you could roll a nickel down the road and hit five new subdivisions that were being built. Took us a month to sell and we had to sell to a cash investor due a time crunch (had to move to new location before school started).\nStill today inventory is very high in this area, but prices are still inflated because it's a desirable place to live--basically like Florida with fewer hurricanes.'",
        "In response to 'This can't go on. And if it can't go on, it won't.', a user said: 'People are at a breaking point financially. It's not going to look pretty.'",
        "In response to 'You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house.\nOh man, you're gonna hate the concept of inflation.', a user said: 'Inflation? This much in less than three years? It's not like I just stepped out of a time capsule from the 90s.'"
