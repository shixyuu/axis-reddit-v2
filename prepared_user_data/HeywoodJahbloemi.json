        "In response to 'The problem is broadly that it just doesn't work for every company.  10% of the companies in this trial abandoned it being unable to make it work.  30% are fully switched over and will be keeping it long term.  Roughly the remaining 60% haven't fully changed over and aren't finding any efficiency gains yet but are going to continue to try and make it work.\nLike this is companies over one year.  And only 3 out of 10 of them were able to make it work.', a user said: 'didn’t read the study but u mentioned 60% weren’t noticing any efficiency gains but were they experiencing any negative drawbacks? if not, i think that’s enough to warrant switching over especially if it means boosted moral for their employees'",
        "In response to 'Salary job. Doesn’t matter how many hours I worked overtime they wouldn’t have paid.\nIt’s a stupid ass startup mentality.', a user said: 'salary job doesn’t necessarily mean ur exempt from overtime. i would talk to a work attorney next time u take a salary job so u can get the full scope of what ur entitled too!'",
        "In response to 'Yup, I slaved crazy hours for a previous employer.\nThey treated salary workers like infinite labor.\nThey acted like I was being paid fairly and tried to make me feel guilty for not caring about the company as much as the owner does.\nI got paid well for a 40-hour work week, I was NOT paid well for an 80-100 hour work week.\nThe owner \"works\" long hours at the office by taking 2 hour lunches on the company dime and staying late drinking and playing pool.\nI have zero interest in being like my immediate boss who was/is a lonely old man with nothing to show for a lifetime dedicated to work except an ugly Porsche SUV and a son who views his nanny as more of a parent than him.', a user said: 'JUST BC UR SALARY EMPLOY DOES NOT MEAN UR NOT ENTITLED TO OVERTIME! KNOW UR RIGHTS!'"
