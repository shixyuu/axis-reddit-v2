        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'I am a fully remote employee and have been for 20 years or so. I travel about 50% for my job so going to an office historically hasn’t made sense. The company I work for was just bought by another larger bank a couple years ago. Because I live in a city that has an office, they are trying to make me come into an office 3 days a week. My manager is great so I let him know that if I needed to go to an office, I would no longer be able to travel as that would pull me away from home roughly 100% of the time and that just wasn’t practical for me. I said no after hours, no before hours, when we go to conventions I will show up Monday and leave by Friday. No more after hours events, no team dinners, nothing. He’s on board with me not going to the office but I know it will become more of an issue here soon. My plan is to quiet quit. Show up every now and then and leave. Wait until I get fired. Not a single person in the office works with me nor would notice me so I think I could slide by for a while. They assigned me a desk so we will see how long this lasts.'"
