        "In response to 'I think the pandemic really reset people's priorities. A lot of people were working from home or unemployed, and spent time with their families, or relaxing, or on self improvement. After a couple years of that, we all realized that maybe working those extra hours every day isn't that important. Their jobs kept going on, even though they were putting less effort into them.\nI've noticed a big change at my office. If I stay until 5:30, there's only a couple cars left in the parking lot. It used to be busy there until 6 or 7 most days! And the place is pretty empty on Fridays, everyone is \"working from home\".\nPeople seem to value their personal time a lot more, and I think it's a good thing.  Work to live, don't live to work!', a user said: 'Part of it is the labor market in general, too. Before, your boss could toss you out and have you replaced by the end of the following week. Now, the prospect of replacing someone is bleak, at best, and there is less incentive to compete with imaginary masses of job seekers.'"
