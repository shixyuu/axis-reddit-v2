[External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: 'Quiet quitting, what a bunch of bullshit.\nThe extra effort you put in at work just becomes expected, set the bar low when you start a new job and go from there.\nDO NOT DO EXTRA WORK WITHOUT STANDING UP FOR YOURSELF AND EXPECTING SOMETHING IN RETURN....THIS IS NOT SELFISH...THIS IS BUSINESS.\nKNOW YOUR VALUE.\nExpand your knowledge and skills,  and you can find work very easily.'"
