        "In response to 'Dude, I'm the same way, I avoid MFT (Mandatory Fun Time) at all costs.  When they make us do stupid lunches together I just bring my laptop and do work.  I genuinely belive all the people I work with are nice people, but that's where our relationship ends.  I get asked to go on all these staff outings and I'm just like, \"Nah, I just want to be with my wife and kids and my dog.\"\nI've been pulled aside a few times and my response is always the same, \"Is it a requirement for this job to spend time outside work hours to go to these things?  Because if so are you going to be paying me for them?\"\nAnd it's always some response of, \"Well it really would be nice, you are valued here.\"', a user said: 'My boss and coworkers seem to be gearing up to a work vacation somewhere. I've made my desire to never ever fly again known, but I certainly feels like I'm the one spoiling things for them.\nI just don't like airplanes and I'm not going to make up a lie, or worse, suck it up and go with them to make them feel better.'"
