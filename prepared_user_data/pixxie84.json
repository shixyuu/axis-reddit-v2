        "In response to 'at least you woke up sooner, took me 10 yrs chasing the carrot at the end of their stick and finally woke up when the pandemic hit and inflation soared, 3% raise, more work due to short staffing, meanwhile they gave new hires a 20% increase from the year before to minimize the turnover rate, my reward for going above and beyond and sticking it out, more responsibilities lol jokes on them, add all the responsibilities you want my output will be 50% of my capacity from now on, bare minimum just not to get hassled', a user said: 'Yep. That was me during the pandemic too. Guy doing payroll quit and I’d helped build the time and attendance system so guess who got roped in to doing payroll with two weeks of training? Yep. Me. Then the HR admin quit so I took over that too. This was all on top of my resource planning job. 80 hour weeks, working from site for 5 days and 1 day at home.\nStressing myself out so badly that my hair was falling out, which lead me to shaving my head for the first time, getting really upset and having my first hemiplegic migraine.\nThen I finally got admitted to have the surgery I needed to remove dead tissue, cysts and an ovary. I was supposed to be on leave for two weeks but got called in after 3 days. After major abdominal surgery. So I walked the two miles to site as I cant drive, was told they finally had someone to replace me doing payroll and I’d be going back to just doing my job. Great. Except they wanted me to take a 3k paycut which worked out to less than I’d started on. So I quit instead.\nI’m never doing extra work for a job again. I’m not putting myself through additional stress for no additional effort from the company. Fuck that.'"
