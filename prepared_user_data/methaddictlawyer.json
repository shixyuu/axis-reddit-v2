        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone else's departments like completely falling apart due to people quitting / quiet quitting? We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: 'I like how IT people without any management training / experience think they can just be given a director title and fix all the problems of an IT department.\nI've been a VP, and let me tell anyone who wants to listen.\nIf you even remotely enjoy doing technical work, then management is not for you.\n90% of your time is going to be filled with peoples personal problems and upper managements requests.\n\"I can't work with him\"\n\"He wants to do it this way, I disagree and think we should do it that way\"\n\"He/She is lazy and keeps sending me too many tickets\"\n\"I'm depressed / stressed and need 3 months off work\"\n\"My wife took the kids and left\"\n\"My car broke down and I can't afford to fix it so I can't come in the office\"\nI can go on for hours.\nThen you have executives / upper management who have insane requests\n\"We need to cut the IT budget by 70%\"\n\"Can we just save money at the new location by NOT using any cabling and use WiFi only?\"\n\"My friend at company X said he's buying used computers and they save $Y per year, I think we should do that!\"\n\"We got a great deal on a lease for this new office but we need to be in there within a month\"\nThis is the type of crap you're going to deal with, working in IT management is a fucking shit job, I'd rather clean toilets than ever deal with managing an IT department ever again.\nIt doesn't even pay that well, I earn a *shitload* more as a security consultant than I did as a manager or VP and I have so much less stress and responsibility.'",
        "In response to 'This man knows the struggle.\nI can put faces to every single line item that was listed.  Not kidding.', a user said: 'I'm not even mentioning employees who end up hating you because you have to bring them bad news constantly.\n\"Sorry you need to keep that 8 year old server/application/router alive for another year because we don't have the budget for it this year\"\nNow you're the asshole because you happened to prioritize some other project based on the whim of an executive who wants to spend the money on that, rather than upgrading failing infrastructure.\nSo of course there are employees under you who *think* they can do a better job because you had to deny them something, when they have NO CLUE about the bigger picture and the amount of shit you need to eat to even have any semblance of a functional technology division.\nThis breeds resentment, blah blah blah, I'm sure anyone who has managed a reasonable sized IT department know it's not a walk in the park and honestly the job has nothing to really do with IT.'"
