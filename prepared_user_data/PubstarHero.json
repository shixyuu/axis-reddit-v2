        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone else's departments like completely falling apart due to people quitting / quiet quitting? We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: 'So first off, it seems you have zero clue what Quiet Quitting is.  Thats when people who are paid to work a 9 to 5 only work their 9 to 5.  Not 9 to 7.  Not 9 to 6.  9 to 5.  You know, wanting a work/life balance.  In this industry that is not always the case (I've had some nasty 80+ hour weeks, but I always got my time back later).\nAlso you must not really be watching the job market.  I'm regularly seeing $130k + Full Remote for jobs that will manage fewer people and servers, or at least on a team to split a workload though that is in my field which may be a bit more expensive given I'm working contracting public sector.\nSo the real question is how much are you actually offering (or are you even listing salary because I wont bother if thats not up front), and how much of this is in your job description?'"
