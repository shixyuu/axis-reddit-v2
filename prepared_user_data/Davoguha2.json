        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is “quiet quitting” even a thing? Quiet quitting is defined as someone only doing what’s in their job description and nothing more. My question is: why the fuck is there even a term for this, and why does said term involve “quitting?” Why is it apparently an expectation that someone should do more than what they have been hired to do? This is something that has always appalled me, ever since my very first job.\nIn one of my first jobs, my boss would give serious side eye whenever I refused to do something that pretty clearly wasn’t part of the job I was hired to do. I wasn’t particularly successful in that job and quickly realized that part of doing the corporate dance is doing whatever people ask you to do at all times no matter what.\nThe thing is, doesn’t the term “quiet quitting” imply that you’re inherently not doing part of your job? Shouldn’t that be the proper definition? Not “not doing things that already aren’t part of your job?” What the fuck is happening lol', a user said: 'Your definition of quiet quitting is what makes it confusing.\nIdk what the real definition is, and I'm gonna talk out of my ass before I look it up.\nIn my mind, quiet quitting is more than \"just doing your duties and nothing more\" - it implies that you are actively under-performing your duties, moreso you are stringing along until they cut you loose.\nGot a weekly report due on Wednesdays? You might have it done on Thursday.. probably Friday - and it's minimal work at best. Are you on-call after hours? Maybe you're ignoring half the calls.\nTo me, quiet quitting isn't \"doing the bare minimum\" - it is doing\nless\nthan that, getting away with getting paid for NOT doing your job, until you get canned.'"
