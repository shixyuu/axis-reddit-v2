        "In response to 'Original Post: How’s this for quiet quitting? I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'I've only been on this job for a year but I've been doing exactly this, and it's not because I'm quitting. It's because I never have enough work to do, and they told me to not deliver things fast, to take my time, but my job is pretty easy so I just waste time. By the way, I have great benefits and the best salary of my life. I feel lazy tho and sometimes guilty.'"
