        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'I’m so sick of all this nonsense. Just work what you feel you’re capable of and don’t burn yourself out? Like. Be a reasonable person.\nSome people are fine doing some work on Sundays and that makes them happy. Some won’t work a minute past contract and that makes them happy. BOTH CAN EXIST you ding dongs.'",
        "In response to 'BUT, admin points towards the people who work outside their contract hours as the \"baseline\" expectation.', a user said: 'idk. I've worked in 3 schools now and none of my admin did this. And if they did who cares, there's a contract.'"
