        "In response to 'The article says the average difference was 3.6 minutes per week. It doesn't seem like it's a lot of people cutting 10+ hours out of their week because of some drug-induced epiphany. It's just as likely that it cleared their mind and helped them focus on work a little better, enough that in 40+ hours of work they can be efficient enough to save... 3.6 minutes. Or better yet the type of people who do shrooms are just ever so slightly less likely to want to work overtime based on purely correlative factors.', a user said: 'It's a fairly sensational headline, especially with the non-neutral phrase \"quiet quitting.\"\nThe\nstudy\n, or at least its abstract, doesn't look like it's telling us sort of cause and effect that the headline does. Like you point out, there's a lot of explanations for the findings, and we don't even know if the implied idea (working less = bad employee that the boss doesn't like) is supported at all. It could just as easily be like what you're saying, a better worker that doesn't need to work overtime, who might even be more appreciated by the workplace.\nEh, sloppy journalism.'"
