        "In response to 'Original Post: How to effectively quiet quit as the highest performer on my team I am the team's highest performer. I have a lead IC role (\"hybrid management\") where a lot of my job duties involve coaching, development plans and employee growth. I am one of two lead ICs and there are like 3-4 other ICs on the team.\nOver the past two years, I've taken this position very seriously and have operated at a much higher level (the position above mine) than expected. I was rapidly promoted to lead IC in less than a year and I have been told that going into full management is \"mine if I want it\". The difference between myself and the other ICs on the team (including lead IC) is pretty dramatic. I'm easily doing twice or three times the workload and have a much higher operational proficiency, client satisfaction, etc.\nFor a plethora of reasons, I've become totally disillusioned with the institution, middle/upper management, and the position. What's compounding my anger/depression is that I took my position as a downgrade in my career, but intended to be underpaid and underappreciated for 2-ish years to build up hands-on experience in a new industry. I've been ACTIVELY trying to get OUT and make a lateral or upwards move (externally, not internally as my institution does not offer internal jobs) and because of the PARTICULARLY shitty state of the white-collar job market (\"worse than 2008\"), I have been faced with rejection after rejection after rejection, usually after getting 99% of the way there. I also have particular grievances about the way that middle/upper management has \"strung me along\" on a variety of promises. I look back and see that I'm literally ROTTING in what was supposed to be a temporary position, in the prime years of my career, and I feel STUCK (can't get out no matter how hard I try).\nIt's important to note that I really don't *like* the idea of quiet-quitting. I always used to say \"why would you quiet quit? Just go find a better job that you feel fulfilled in\". The problem now is that I'm so bitter at the institution that putting in extra effort feels nauseating and violating, and I'm STUCK at this job due to the extremely terrible job market (unless I restart my career entirely or quit without a job lined up).\nAnyways, circling back to the point of my question: I've become widely known as such an aggressive overperformer that my bosses have flat-out told me that overperformance has become my new baseline for expected monthly performance. I used to easily get \"exceeds expectations\" every month, whereas now they want me to continuously struggle and squeeze every drop of effort out of myself just to justify a \"meets expectations\". My goal for quiet quitting is to start putting in the same amount of effort as the other lead IC, who notoriously underperforms but is never held accountable. However, it's going to become extremely and immediately apparent as soon as my next monthly performance evaluation hits, and my managers are going to be asking me \"WTF is going on\".\nI fear that this will immediately result in 1-2 months of \"does not meet expectations\", followed swiftly by a PIP or something like that. I'll be told to go back to my previous baseline, and when I don't, I'll be accused of insubordination or something. I really don't want to deal with this level of mental stress, especially as I'm already highly depressed from my rejections while job-searching.\nDo any managers here have an idea of what I should do to effectively and smartly go from \"ultra top performer\" to quiet-quitter?', a user said: 'I’m sorry too much whining. You took the job willingly to get experience, which you got, now you’re whining because you can’t quit and move on as easily as you would like. You put yourself in this situation to get taken advantage of. If you want to work less, do it. If you want to make demands of the bosses do it.  If you want to quit, quit. No one forced you to work 3x as hard as the other guy for the same salary/position.'",
        "In response to 'I'm whining because of TIMING and the fact that this ordinarily would have been a good career move for me. Of course I have to happen to do it and be in this position during an extraordinary time where shitter-in-chief is actively destroying the economy and flooding the job market to further his agenda. I just got declined from an amazing back-office position the recruiter told me I would have been a shoe-in for if it wasn't for huge amounts of additional candidates and out of those hundreds of course there was 1 that had just slightly more experience in the specific niche thing that job was about', a user said: 'Bro stop it. Spend more time on job search and less time feeling sorry for yourself. I’m going to take a guess here that you are working 40 hours a week. Quiet quitting is for losers. Just because your peer is a completely dead weight doesn’t make you such a superstar. If you are as good as you think, keep on doing what you’re doing and keep on looking and you’ll find it soon. It absolutely does not benefit you in any way to go out with a whimper and ruin your reputation with everyone you’ve worked with over there. You never know when someone might have an opportunity or if you’d even like to come back, go out on a high.  So you lost out on ONE job to a better candidate boo hoo. I’m no fan of the current administration but like i said cream rises to the top. Sincerely - good luck.'",
        "In response to 'It's not even one job, it was time and time again. It just KEEPS happening and I'm not used to that after having job searched in 2015, 2019 and 2023 when times were really easy for applicants. And when I was busting ass in my current role and making a huge positive reputation for myself, it was all for naught - my local upper management just wants to dangle fake stuff in front of me and use me for my effort (they don't care about me) and all the other managers in other departments can't give me jobs because of the region-lock. Otherwise I would already have transferred out into a more long-term and fulfilling role. I feel totally stuck and it feels worthless to even keep trying. Even if some people notice it makes no difference anyhow and I already have the positive referrals from ex-managers who left the company. Just hurst', a user said: 'I got laid off and took a new “temporarily” position at a significant pay cut a year before covid.  Then shit went bananas and i was stuck there, “underpaid” for a few more years. Boo hoo. Least i had a job. I killed it, did a cert (first one in a decade), now i’m back waaaaay above when I got laid off. Like i said cream rises, more applying, less complaining.'"
