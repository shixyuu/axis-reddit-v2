        "In response to 'It’s called “working to rule”. This new term is bullshit to make it sound as though you’re doing something wrong.', a user said: 'Work to rule is usually kind of a malicious compliance deal where you follow all the rules to generate disruption.\nIn the late 90s rail workers doing overnight repair work successfully brought work to nearly a dead stop by following rules for toilet breaks. One man on each crew was responsible for safety oversight. Instead of twitching themselves at the side of the tracks a worker would ask to go to the toilet and the safety officer would have to accompany them. Since this would leave the rest of the crew with no safety officer they too would join the trek to the loo. Shortly after they got back another would realise he needed to relieve himself.'"
