        "In response to 'Just a heads up but there is no legal requirement for a 2 weeks notice anywhere in the US. It’s just an old custom nothing more. Legally though there are certain requirements each state has in place regarding payout of final wages but none include a mandatory “2 weeks” notice', a user said: 'To add to this:\n2 weeks notice is only useful for jobs that do the schedule week-to-week. It gives management sufficient time to remove you from availability for future scheduling while covering any currently scheduled shifts, as they are typically drawn up a week ahead of time. It was never about \"finding a replacement.\" You cannot reasonably recruit, hire, and train within 2 weeks.\nSoftware takes most of the burden of scheduling away, but (at least in my state) schedules need to be made available 1 week in advance, which is why an abrupt quitting creates a problem, since a new schedule cannot be forced on people with less than a week's notice. Lazy managers will try to force employees to come in, but ultimately, with less than 7 days notice, it's management's problem, not the employees.'",
