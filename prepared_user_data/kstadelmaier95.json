        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I also don’t like the term “quiet quitting”. You’re just sticking to your contract. I don’t do more than what’s in my contract. Come in at 7:15, leave at 2.\nLast year we had mandatory biweekly meetings that were all about reading goals and whatnot and didn’t apply to me (I’m orchestra), so I’d just have my camera and mic off and play my switch or practice violin. This year they’re weekly and in person, so no switch for me. 😑\nI don’t lesson plan much at all. I teach beginners, so I have the curriculum pretty much set in my head. I take some notes weekly to keep track of where we are in the curriculum, but that’s it. No formal lesson plans.\nIf I have a lesson group where kids don’t come one week for whatever reason, I use it as a free period and decompress/take a brain break.\nMy kids come for lessons at a specified time, and if they’re late, I don’t hold them over. They leave when they’re supposed to leave so I have my ten minutes to prep for the next kids.\nI love my kiddos and my instruction time is used well and efficiently, but I’m not going to run myself into the ground by using every single free minute to prep or do extra work.'"
