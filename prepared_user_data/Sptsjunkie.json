        "In response to 'If you are doing your job and keeping things running, then whatâ€™s the problem? Why are employees always expected to go above and beyond? More work for no extra pay.', a user said: 'Whenever someone mentions that employees are Quiet Quitting, I ask if they are sure they had not already Quietly Fired the employees first.  Goes something like:\nMe:\nAre you sure you didn't already Quietly Fire them?\nThem:\nWhat do you mean?\nMe:\nWell, how often do you give them an extra $1000 / $5 an hour on their paychecks instead of  the bare minimum in their employment contract?\nThem:\nHuh?  I pay their salary/hourly rate.  Why would I pay more?\nMe:\nSounds like a Quiet Firing then.  You are paying what you agreed to and they are doing the work they agreed to.  I'd recommend going above and beyond on pay to show how much you care if you want more.\nIt's amazing how the businesses who control the different media outlets try to spin doing your contractual obligation as some sort of negative, while never considering that companies do more than the bare minimum on pay.  As soon as you spin it back and suggest companies are lazy or unmotivated if they pay \"the bare minimum\" outlined in the contract, it brings everything into focus for a lot of people.'"
