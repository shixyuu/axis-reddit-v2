        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting going around the store. We are done running around like slaves on cocaine (that we paid for). It's spreading. Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. üí™', a user said: 'I worked my ass off as a lot guy for 15$/hr and then I transferred stores, they said they didn‚Äôt have a spot for lot guy but I would be paid as front end lot and work in the garden as well as being carts in, by myself, in the Arizona heat. So I watered, stocked and worked the garden, and did a massive cart run every 45 minutes. I asked to be put into another dept but all they had was cashier.\nThere was one day when I saw my garden supervisor just sitting down on his phone while I was wrapping a pallete, he called me over to tell me I was doing it wrong (I definitely was not) so I dealt with the BS, worked the rest of th day. The next day I took my break as per usual, however this particular day I took 1 extra minutes to wash my face covered in dirt and sweat, an Oompa Loompa looking manager stomped over (in flip flops????) and told me my breaks are not to exceed 15 minutes. So I clocked out, the next day I wrote on a sheet of paper ‚ÄúI quit, I expect my vacation pay as part of my next paycheck‚Äù fuck Home Depot, they are wage slave driving money hungry pigs, every single one'"
