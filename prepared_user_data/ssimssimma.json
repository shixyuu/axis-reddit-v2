'Rage applying' is the latest form of worker revenge | CBC Radio [External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/rage-applying-1.6759642', a user said: 'Trying to find better for yourself when you know nothing is going to happen for you where you're at is not \"revenge\" or malicious or aggressive in any way. What a bullshit headline. In the last 5 years I've gone up $10 in hourly wage just because I was able to recognize a dead end and get out of it as soon as I could. I've changed jobs like two or three times a year in the last few years and it was frustrating and stressful in its own right but I'd hate to think of where I'd be if I trusted the people I worked for to care about my financial needs or goals or recognize my potential to advance in a company.'"
