        "In response to 'Yes, you are, but SFPD also has a point. The DA probably won't prosecute all but the most violent (or notorious) crimes, because the DA knows the judges here will not convict. Indeed, they might not even timely schedule the trial and then force a dismissal of the charges.\nhttps://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/criminal-cases-in-sf-dismissal/3626171\nI'm not a fan of the way SFPD is failing in its mission, but I can understand how demoralized they'd be with endless catch-and-release.\nEDIT: Yes, yes, juries convict and judges sentence, but SF juries and judges alike show a disposition against either.', a user said: 'Entry-level in SFPD is $103k with gold-plated benefits.  Goes up to $200k and even more with experience and OT.\nI couldn't care less if they are demoralized.  They can do their jobs which they are paid handsomely for.  If they are depressed they can use their ample healthcare benefits to get counseling.'"
