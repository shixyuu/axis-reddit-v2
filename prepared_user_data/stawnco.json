Millennials and Gen Zers are quietly working second jobs as they live paycheck to paycheck [External Link]: https://fortune.com/2023/05/19/quiet-quitting-side-hustle-second-job-millennials-gen-z-paycheck-deloitte/', a user said: 'only 2 jobs? i grew up in a trailer. I just turned 40, and still working 3 jobs. i was finally able to purchase a home, but still not sure i will ever be able to retire comfortably. i probably work 80 hours a week. my third job is sales, hopefully i can perform well enough to replace my corporate 9-5 job.'",
        "In response to 'On a serious note how do you work 3 jobs and sleep?\nIs like each jobs 8 hours = 24 Hours and you manage to sleep during some of the tjme?\nOr is it full time and partial for the others so y can actually sleep?', a user said: 'I've worked full time in corporate telecom for almost  10 years (ohio, pay ok). they let me work from home after 2 years, so i started doing airbnb arbitrage (renting a home to rent it on airbnb). I've been doing that for about 7 years, but finally bought a Florida house with that income. florida is great for airbnb, but expensive to live here, so to keep up with my goals, i started selling life insurance on my days off. sleep can still be achieved at the expense of having a social life. hopefully with insurance and airbnb, i can eventually quit the 9-5 telecom. then my remaining 2 jobs are at least flexible schedules. this is the way.'"
