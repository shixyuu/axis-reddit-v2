Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite. Power to the people. ðŸ’ª', a user said: 'WORK TO RULE! The new term has negative connotations for the worker and makes the employer look like a victim. People have been work to rule for decades, welcome to the team!'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'Same with \"working your wage\". Ya they are new, funny, or whatever they are but they take away from the worker and give power to the employer. Stop using these new terms, they suck'"
