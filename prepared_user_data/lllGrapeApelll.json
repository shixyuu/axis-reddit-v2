        "In response to 'This is my fear, not only is there a lot of underemployed young people, there's also just a lot of men relative to women in China right now. Official numbers estimate China's sex ratio demographics are ~52% men and ~48% women, that doesn't seem like a big disparity until you remember how big China's population is. The simple math bears out to around 18\nmillion\nmore men than women. Unless the Chinese suddenly pick up a huge polyandry fetish, a lot of those men are going to end up alone and unattached because there aren't enough partners of their preferred sex.\nAs you mentioned, sociological history shows a pretty stark pattern of what happens when you have too many underemployed, unattached men in your country. They either start breaking shit and causing unrest because they're angry and directionless, or they end up recruited into the country's military and used as manpower for meat grinding wars.\nAnd make no mistake, any attempt by China to take Taiwan, any of their southern neighbors, or their land disputes with India\nwill\nbe a meat grinder of huge proportions.', a user said: 'China is not energy independent nor food independent. Any invasion that results in sanctions will likely lead to one of the biggest humanitarian crises in history.'"
