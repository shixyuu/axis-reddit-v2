        "In response to 'Original Post: How many of you have \"quiet quit\" and when did it start for you? I got to say for me I quiet quit my last job 5-6 years into it after realizing I didn't have a future with that company, but I never left because I was at least getting paid and now have a decent savings account because of it. I legit started my new job early this year and I've already quiet quitted. I hardly do the bare minimum since I gave them a whole summer of hard work and not a single fucking praise. Or even any kind of \"hey keep it up you've been doing an awesome job\". The moment I make a mistake I feel like it destroys everything i worked hard for so what's the point anymore? I'm just going to keep working enough so I don't get fired, but if I do I doubt I'll be upset over it. It also just seems the way 2023 has went if the economy and housing market continues to stay awful next year I can already see people quiet quitting for 2024 and it hasn't even started yet!', a user said: 'Been doing it since 2022.  Been working out pretty well.  No raises to be had but not due to the quiet quitting, due to budgets...funding...etc.  My peers haven't gotten raises either.  And some of them are working their asses off.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'Good for them.  Working yourself to death for someone else without reaping any benefit is basically slavery.  Work you wage and don't mix work with personal life activities.'"
