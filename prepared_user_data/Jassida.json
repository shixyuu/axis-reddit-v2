        "In response to 'Original Post: New type of quitting discovered \"Quiet quitting is easy to identify; employees who are quiet quitters visibly reduce their effort and avoid going the extra mile. Soft quitting, on the other hand, happens quietly over time. Employees don’t necessarily reduce their work output, but their enthusiasm fades, their curiosity dwindles, and their emotional connection to their work diminishes.\"\nThe cure is to lick the boot harder.', a user said: 'Soft and quiet quitting is what people do when companies don’t give them any reason to be invested.\nNot every company can offer progress but if they don’t, they should be transparent about it.\nI think a very high percentage is caused by the employer taking for granted the initial goodwill employees give to be seen as a good candidate for promotion.\nAfter a year of going above and beyond, the employer needs to be saying either promotion or chill out a bit. They don’t though.'"
