        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'I'm curious about sol and ari. I mean they corked ari with a pacifier for at least 7 years. Are Robyn and Kody worried what sol and ari might say? I mean it's not like Kody had any issue with filming his kids until now. Maybe Robyn sees how despised she and Kody are and don't want her tenders ridiculed in school. It's just odd that they don't film in the house. Even if they film while the kids r in school'"
