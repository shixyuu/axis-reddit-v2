        "In response to '\"Taking 10\" and \"taking 20\" are rules used in an old edition.\nTaking 10 is effectively what passive perception is, but for any and all skills. It is intended to be used when the character is attempting a task that a) there's no intense time restraints/initiative and b) have no direct downsides to failure. It fixes the player just rolling again and again until they succeed on a roll they can conceivably just repeat.\nTaking 20 is the version for when they character conceivably has plenty of time to roll again and again until a 20 is rolled with absolutely no downsides to failure to failing or trying again. So they just take the time and are assumed to have gotten a maximum result.', a user said: 'Taking 10 is effectively what passive perception is, but for any and all skills.\nYou say that like Passive Perception is somehow unique.

So they just take the time and are assumed to have gotten a maximum result.\n5e has take 20 without calling it that. From the DMG:\nSometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With enough attempts and enough time, a character should eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating the check allows a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.'"
