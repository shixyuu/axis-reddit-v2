Get our bag at their expense. Because, eff them.'",
        "In response to 'Speaking from experience, this!\nI’ve held off on getting rid of people for a bit longer because I knew that Q4 or Q1 were going to ask for reductions and it was better in the long run to term that crappy teammate at that time.\nI had to do it twice in the last calendar year and got called out by members of my team both times and had to behave really professionally until they saw the long game haha. Even my boss has done it.\nAnd if anyone was wondering, no… terming them earlier doesn’t mean I just don’t have to lay off somebody later. You’d think it would if you don’t replace them but… it doesn’t ever work like that haha.', a user said: 'Had no clue it worked like this. Why 1st and 4th quarters though? I had a coworker who was MIA for hours at a time, every day, never met goals, this went on for months. Then she was finally let go right before conversion from temp to perm. But they kept 2 other slackers on my team, and they've been slacking an additional 6.months now. If what you say is true, I can't wait for 1st quarter'"
