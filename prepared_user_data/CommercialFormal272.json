        "In response to 'someone else said it best. The phrase \"Acting your wage\" is way more fitting', a user said: '\"If they wanted me to care more, then they would pay me more.\" This is my mantra at work. I get paid kinda decent, so I kinda care about the place as a whole and take pride in my personal work responsibilities. Caring about work outside of my station is not within my pay grade. That is literally what managers are paid for, and I am not a manager.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I agree, except that this may be a case of understaffing, and the co-worker no longer being willing to do the work of 1.5+ people, when he should only need to do the work of 1, and OP now being expected to do the work of 2+ people to bring the total back to 3+. I would suggest that OP quiet quit, and take a look at what the situation is if each person does a single person's worth of work. If there is still work left, that isn't necessarily a worker's fault, but a case of their being to few workers.'"
