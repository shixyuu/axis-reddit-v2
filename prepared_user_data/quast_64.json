        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: '\"I'm just a team player, and i was doing things the team wasn't, so I am realigning myself to the team's standard again.\" But only if anybody asks.'",
        "In response to 'What about those ‚Äúand other duties as needed‚Äù bs in contacts? Is this how employers get around this?', a user said: 'Simple, as a worker i don't need them. If you want other stuff done as employer, be specific in your job description, then we can renegotiate compensation.\nIt would be similar as saying to your boss \"yeah you pay me for my work, but besides that you have to pay me more than agreed upon\"'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of work‚Äîlife balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'To distract from the real problem of employers underpaying their employees... What else, it is just another form of \"but... look at them!\"'"
