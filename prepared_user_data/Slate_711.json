        "In response to 'Original Post: It’s now “quiet quitting” to not go beyond your job responsibilities [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/rb5pth0h04i91.jpg', a user said: 'Quiet firing (verb) when a company does not fire  personnel but instead does the bare minimum to ensure workers are taken care of in terms of payment and reasonable hours, usually in favor of higher profits.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'It’s a fair point of view to have. The author could be a writer who was pressured by their boss to pump out this garbage. Doesn’t make what’s written less wrong. At the end of the day however advocating for workers rights doesn’t exclude those like this author. They can write the pieces but they still stand to benefit from improvements across the board.'",
        "In response to 'My wife’s contract job was full time for 2 months (in fact overtime) and then said it would be part time. Their part time has been them calling her in when they need her, about 8-16 hours a week maybe a total of 60 hours over 4 months.\nHer work just says “if we don’t call you then we don’t need you” so she’s been looking for different work since then.', a user said: 'A lot of jobs don’t value you as a person. If your family starved to death tomorrow they would put out an ad offering the same deal to someone else. I hope she finds something better that actually appreciates the work she puts in'"
