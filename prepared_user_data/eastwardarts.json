        "In response to 'It's fairly infamous as a \"guy thing\" which has been the \"I'm done with her but I don't want to breakup so I'm just gonna stop caring about the relationship\".\nThe difference is that that maneuver requires making THEM dump you vs you getting everything together to dump them.', a user said: 'It's a weird sort of power move. The one who cares less in a relationship has the most power. They get off on it.\nMy now ex-husband admitted in marriage counseling that this was part of how he tried to control me in our marriage. (The other part was essentially clinical passive aggression: agreeing to my face whenever I raised a concern, then intentionally doing more of what I had told him bothered or hurt me, as a way for him to feel more powerful.) I immediately dumped his sadistic ass.'",
        "In response to 'I suppose it's more so for his benefit than it is mine. I was ready to pull the trigger on it 2 weeks ago, but then he told me that day happened to be a negative anniversary, and that the whole month of February was a sore spot for him. So here it is March, I'm planning on doing it within the next couple of weeks.', a user said: 'Who gives a shit? Would he be that considerate of you?'",
        "In response to 'Lmao, no. The first time he broke up with me, he called me at 2 in the morning while I was playing a game with a friend.', a user said: 'Right. You don’t owe him any consideration. Breaking up is a unilateral decision. You don’t need permission, just reclaim your power and drop his ass.'"
