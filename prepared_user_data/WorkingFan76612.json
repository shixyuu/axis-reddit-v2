You start from zero and you go all the way to hero. They put you up and running. So, there is no shortage. They just don’t want to spend more money.'",

For some reason people on Reddit always frame this topic in terms of unskilled labor and about how companies just don’t want to pay. I’m working in a highly skilled environment and have req’s we are trying to fill with comp ranges from 200K+ and we still really struggle to hire. Our comp isn’t the issue, a shortage of skilled labor is.', a user said: 'But they are not willing to train …'",
        "In response to 'Yeah. basically what happened to me. I got fired after a nice six month period of crushing burnout. Oh, you're not sure you can meet the deadline for this design? Well here, you need to print, fold, and organize these 200 prints for mfg since you're the only one in the office. Guess you'll just need to work more. I had to do a lot of reworks due to salesperson/customer fuckups and not once was a deadline changed. I was still only making what I was told I'd make straight out of college 15 years ago. Fuck that. Why would I want to go back to that shit?', a user said: 'What Mexicans say: Mucho trabajo, poco dinero. “Lots of work for very little money.”'"
