        "In response to 'I have been working on it for a long time. Months. Been unhappy a long time, and taking steps to eliminate my anxiety and find outlets. This job finally got to the point it was clearly affecting my mental and even physical health. When I brought that up to my manager, he shrugged it off and told me to relax. I don't feel bad at all if I happen to have thrown him under the bus in my final messages to management.', a user said: 'Good for you, I am happy for you because I felt your pain. It took me 20 years at the same toxic far below average paying job, but I finally grew a set and quit on monday morning. I didn't quit in quite the spectacular fashion as you but I finally had enough of the stress and anxiety. For me it was the fear of change I guess, that's why I stayed so long. Luckily I had lined up a much better job with no toxicity and considerably better pay. I actually start this coming monday. \nI hope everything goes well for you, keep your head up and good luck. I am rooting for you!'",
        "In response to 'That sounds like quite a turnaround. Congrats.\nAre you hiring?', a user said: 'You will turn things around too. Sometimes it takes a bit of time, patience and hard work (or 20 years of it lol). But pieces will start to fall together and before you know it you'll be laughing about all of this. I hope you are able to at least feel a little bit confident in knowing you did what was best for you. Once you have established that, you will be unstoppable.\nI wish we were still hiring, I would try to help some of my former coworkers escape before they have to suffer anymore.'"
