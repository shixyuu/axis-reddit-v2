        "In response to 'You're doing it already :) It's the same as\nwork-to-rule\n, just a negative phrase to make it seem like a bad thing.\nEdit: Apparently we're calling it \"act your wage\" now?', a user said: 'WTH why is working exactly as the process considered \"bad\"? There is a reason why the processes exist, and they should be performed to the letter?\nWhere I work skipping some steps could lead to quite a shitshow (global payroll for the client) and the superiors are way keener on extending deadlines (the deadlines are set a week prior to the actual deadline so that it can be extended) than on skipping some steps in the processes.\nThe funny part is that we are told that we don't do overtime unless there is a major business justification. And even if it is, we are to take it in lieu during the same/next week. The company doesn't want to pay us extra, but there is no reason for us to go the extra mile and stay after.'"
