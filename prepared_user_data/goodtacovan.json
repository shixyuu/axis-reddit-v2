We are tired of not being paid enough to afford food and rent.'",
        "In response to 'They will just performance you out. Corporations arnt going to pay people more. They structure the jobs to be minimal work. If they pay you more they will expect more. Eventually you cant afford not to work so they win. They just keep the tasks remidal so if turnover is high it will have little impact on team member level jobs. Some one else in the thread said 23 people already gone....doesnt sound like its working out.', a user said: 'Who are they going to replace us with?  They can't even get enough people to fill the registers'",
        "In response to 'Even less qualified people. Have you not been to Walmart? Ive seen people who look like they are currently going through rehab and detoxicing working there. Like i said eventually they win because you need money or become homeless. Its why becoming a union is so hard. People cross the line to work.', a user said: 'You know Walmart can't keep staff either, right?  And they pretty much pay the same'"
