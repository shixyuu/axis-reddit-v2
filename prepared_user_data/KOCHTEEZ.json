        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is declining—45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'This is a cycle you see in a lot of countries. One generation works hard in physical jobs like farming, then it shifts to factory work, and later to office jobs. As families build wealth, their kids often grow up with more comfort and less of the same drive to hustle. At the same time, companies face challenges like inflation and rising costs, and they struggle to keep productivity up. That’s when things like quiet quitting show up.\nThough to be fair, a lot of younger workers see it less as laziness and more as setting healthy boundaries after decades of corporate overwork. It’s a mix of economic shifts and changing attitudes toward work-life balance.'"
