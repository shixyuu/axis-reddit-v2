You mean feeling fatigued due to nonstop stress?', a user said: 'I have to think this article is wrong, at least for what I consider \"quiet quitting\" to be.  It is somewhere between \"doing the bare minimum and doing enough not to get fired (but even if you do, that's also fine)\"\n45% of the Japanese work force did not go from working 12+ hours/day to that. Maybe they are working 8-10 hour days and 5 days/week, and that is their regional version of quiet quitting.'"
