        "In response to 'I have heard of and used take 5. But take 10? Like for our of combat delayed checks maybe?', a user said: 'Yes, it's an old 3.5/PF rule for no risk situations. There's also taking 20 for situations where there's no time restraint and the player could theoretically just role until they get a 20.\nI fudged the rules for comedic purposes in the article.'",
        "In response to 'do people really do this? I've never heard of taking a 10 before I feel like that goes against the random nature of the game that makes it interesting', a user said: 'It's mostly for mundane checks so higher level characters don't have to make a bunch of tivial rolls for downtime activities.\nThat said, I have never once taken 10.'",
        "In response to 'This feels like generated content.', a user said: 'It's content generated by me. I wrote it.'",
        "In response to 'OP confirmed a generator, can you charge my phone, please?', a user said: 'On it. Sending charging vibes your phones way.'"
