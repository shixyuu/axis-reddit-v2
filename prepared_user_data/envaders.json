It happened at a hospital I worked at. They were getting rid of about 2-3 employees in every department . From one day to the next just like that. They did 3 waves of this . I got lucky and got out right after the 3rd wave… from what I hear there was still another wave when I left. They had security escorting you out the building with your belongings. Everyone let go was walked out within minutes of being told, with watery eyes and in silence. There’s your loyalty! People that were let go had 5,10,15yrs of loyalty. Bottom line was let go of positions that didn’t directly support the core of the business.'"
