        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I was made redundant last year and since retired early. I quiet quit since 2020 though and I can’t recommend this enough to people lol.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting, how many people are actually doing this ? I keep hearing this term, just wonder if people are actually doing it.', a user said: 'I love how everything has a kitschy name to it now.\n“quiet quitting” is something I have been doing for 30 years. It’s just having boundaries and respecting your own time. If done right, it actually helps your career. Like one example I recently told a young colleague is that it is ok to sit on an email for a while before replying. Don’t reply to emails like you are sending chat messages.'"
