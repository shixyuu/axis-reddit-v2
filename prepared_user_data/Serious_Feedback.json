        "In response to 'I don't really understand how throwing up a bunch of articles everywhere encouraging people to engage in a work-to-rule job action with a fun new rebrand of the name is\nanti\nunion propaganda.  Work to rule is a good thing.  If tiktok teenagers want to put a new name on it that's fine with me.\nThis is like the people who say \"unskilled labour\" is anti-worker propaganda when it's union advocates who came up with the term in the first place, as a way to recognize people who need unions and labour regulations the most.', a user said: 'Quiet \"quitting\" is framing people doing their job as people\nnot\ndoing their job. It is literal doublespeak.\nIt's trying to take people\ndoing their job\nand cram them into the \"no one wants to work\" pigeonhole.\nSubtle propaganda is still propaganda. Like how BP coined the term \"carbon footprint\" to re-frame climate destabilization as an\nindividual\nproblem that is best solved from the consumer end.'"
