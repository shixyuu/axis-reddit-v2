        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is declining—45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'just wanna drop this issue is not unique to Japan; it is kinda a global phenomenon ~ the term was coined back in 2022 in the US via TiKTok because some influencers talked about the negative impact of overwork. In the US quiet quitting kinda shifted to “survival” mindset due to economic slowdown and layoffs but employee sentiment remains low. Similar things are happening in the EU. \nSince it is Japan focus news, i think younger generations are reacting like that as a response to burnout and i hope organization see this signal that they they need to restructure to re-engage with their workforce, re-defining what work means, and accept that working styles evolve'"
