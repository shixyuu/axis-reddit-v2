        "In response to 'I don’t think quiet quitting is a thing. I think I’m fed up with being under-appreciated and underpaid and I’m no longer giving my employer extra time and effort that only benefits my employer would be a better choice of words\nAlso, yes I have been doing this for about a year now. I spent probably 9 years working my butt off. I worked unpaid overtime and illegally shifted work time around to make it work for my employer, I’ve worked shifts where I’ve repeatedly asked for help and received none, I was constantly coming in on days I had taken off and received very very little in return. So, I’ve started saying no and only putting in what is required of me.', a user said: 'Yep, that’s me. Once you realise that they won’t provide the minimum when YOU need it, that’s it. My favourite saying now (to myself) is not my monkeys not my problem, not my circus etc. sometimes they have to see the results of their bad decisions so no use putting in extra to fix them. A bit sad really.'"
