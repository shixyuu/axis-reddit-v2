        "In response to 'Original Post: Why is quiet quitting even a thing in America? I mean, in Western Europe you're supposed to forget about work once you've spent your 8 hours (hour and a half for lunch and breaks included) at the service of the company.\nI can't understand why is quiet quitting even a thing... How could it be \"quitting\" to do just your regular job and refuse to do overtime or completing tasks outside of your job description? Isn't that what you were hired for? Why should you do unpaid extra work?\nThis mindset of \"you must sacrifice yourself for the company and you must be happy about it\" is downright exploitative and undermines any kind of work‚Äîlife balance.\nIn countries like France, even contacting an employee during their vacation period may get the company into legal trouble, that's the standard in the developed world outside America.', a user said: 'It's ingrained that working hard is the way to get ahead and take pride in your efforts. It's a generational lie passed down to keep to the working class busy with dreams of success. But it's a competition, and only a few win, while the rest lose. The lie is based on the will to power, the survival of the fittest, and the notion that the cream always rises to the top.\nBut it's all lies...\nWhy run a race you can't win? \nWhy work so hard for so little?\nWhy work if you can never own a house?\nNow people want real pay for their time spent at work.\nAfter Covid, they see the real value of their time.\nThe rich see all  this as a marketing failure, and are tryin to pile more bullshit on it ,  in hopes that the problem will just go away.\nStay Mercenary üêÆ'"
