        "In response to 'Original Post: Companies Decide to Keep Four-Day Workweek After Finding It's Better | So-called \"quiet quitting\" could decrease if companies move to a four-day workweek, an ongoing UK study finds. [External Link]: https://gizmodo.com/four-day-workweek-remote-work-tech-jobs-1850139680', a user said: 'Companies like keeping you poor enough to keep you coming back. They think if they can pay you just low enough to not be able to afford yourself on a 4 day, 40hr schedule, you'll willingly do that extra 10hrs the 5th day because you need it. Its cheaper for them to pay a little overtime than to have 2 employees.\nBasic capitalism exploitation of the working class. Luckily people are a bit more headstrong these days and companies are figuring out they can't get away with it as much anymore. In most areas, if you get paid about $23-$25/hr, you're paying the bills comfortably and not stressing yourself unless you have a big family. In america we have associated anything over $14-$15/hr to be getting paid \"a lot\" which is an incredibly ridiculous concept to me when executives and upper management are in the $50-$100/hr payrange and its never an issue.'"
