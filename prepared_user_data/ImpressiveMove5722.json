        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I went back on the tools due to non work stress from a separation resulting in my overall stress being just too much.\nIâ€™ve now got a job where I might do 2 hours of actual work a day at an EBA site (good money and conditions) - I consider myself retired on the job.\nWhy go back to management for an extra $30,000 or $10,000 a year lol.'"
