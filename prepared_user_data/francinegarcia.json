        "In response to 'I lay flat already.  I don’t chase after material goods that normal people want.  No fancy cars for me.  No overpriced clothing bags and what nots for me.  I don’t really care because to be honest expensive doesn’t mean better quality.\nI have enough money to live within my means and I have time to play games, exercise, and read novels that I love.  I live my life as is and I’m happy.\nNot thinking about kids either because that’s whole responsibility I don’t want.  And if people complain about “who’s going to take care of you when you get old?”  No one.  I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m dependent on others to live.  I’ll save up money so I can get euthanasia in another country when I’m getting old.', a user said: 'Hopefully euthanasia laws are more lax in the future. You never know with these things.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'im sure if you was in uni you would have heard of the \"oh GPA doesnt matter that much la\"  \"once you have your first job employer wont look at your GPA already\"\nExcept this is true for the majority of people. No employer past my first job even cared what I majored in, let alone what my GPA was.\ntrue story. this is the typical shit in schooling also la, all say \" eh fuck this im not studying only\" \" aiya dont need work so hard la survive can already\"\nThat's actually good advice, most of the over-achievers in school that I know of aren't high flyers in the corporate world.'"
