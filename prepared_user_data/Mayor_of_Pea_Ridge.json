        "In response to 'Original Post: “Quiet quitting” academia Due to the current funding environment, my research career is in the tank. My university says they will continue to pay me for 6-12 months (I’m in a soft money faculty position but they are finding money to pay those of us with terminated grants), and they want me to continue to submit grant proposals. In no way do I want to waste my energy writing grants that will not get funded, and for so many reasons I am ready to put this part of my life behind me and get out. Is it unethical to let my university continue to pay me while I build out my exit plan? What do I say to them when they press me to keep submitting grants and I know I am not going to?', a user said: 'If you are ready to stop being a research faculty member, I say it's not unreasonable to quiet quit. If not, keep writing and submitting grants. It's not wasted effort unless you have a 100% success rate writing proposals.   It's normal to write proposals that are not awarded and then to re-write those proposals in a better way. If you do get one, and you wrote it/you're the PI, and especially if you write your salary into the budget, why would they hire somebody else to replace you as PI?  Meanwhile, it's going to be really hard to disguise the fact that you're not writing.'"
