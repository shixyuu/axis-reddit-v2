        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'Spent the last 20 plus years working really hard, putting in loads of effort, having no lunch break consistently, doing loads of overtime and got bugger all appreciation. Just watched whilst young lads got promoted and given pay rises and I’ve not had one since 2017. Couple weeks ago, worked until 10.30pm and I’m only paid til 5. They won’t pay overtime either.\nSo fuck them.\nI’ve handed in my notice and going to another place who i have a feeling are going to treat me better.\nI don’t mind working hard, IF you’re appreciated and it gets you somewhere but I’m sick of putting in loads of effort and getting nothing back, getting so stressed I’ve not slept properly in months. It’s just not worth it.'"
