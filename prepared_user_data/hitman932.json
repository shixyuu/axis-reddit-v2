        "In response to 'Original Post: I for one am grateful for APDs quiet quitting bc my vehicle tags are 3 years expired with no plans for renewal on the horizon. Living dangerously over here.', a user said: 'I hadnâ€™t renewed mine since 2020.  Finally got pulled over by Hays County two months back.  Went and got the renewal and they dropped the ticket.  Win win situation for me because I saved $500 in registration fees with nothing bad happening when I was caught.\nI also drive about 40,000 miles a year and use my car for work.'"
