        "In response to 'Wage compression:\nWhen companies offer higher starting salaries to attract new talent without adjusting the pay of current employees\nBasically, the minimum wage jumped in my state, and now they need to offer higher pay to attract new employees, but they didn't adjust the scale for existing workers. I started at this job making $12/hr, which was $3 over minimum wage at the time, and now, after 9 years, I'm making $19/hr - which looks good on paper, except the state minimum wage is now $16/hr, so I'm still making $3 over minimum wage.\nThe worst part is that I'm expected to train kids walking in the door, making as much or more than me, who were in middle school when I started here.', a user said: 'I STILL remember when the theater I worked at did this to me.  I had finally gotten my third raise, but then min wage went up to where I had \"earned\" my way up to, and because of the timing the new hires I was training were eligible for a raise again before I was which meant I was training people to do less work than I was expected to do and they got paid more than I did after working there for three years.  I put my 2 weeks in the day I found out. (well technically I put it in after talking to management for them to basically say \"sucks to be you\")'"
