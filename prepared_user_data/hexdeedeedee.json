        "In response to 'Never truly did the \"quiet quit\" until this year at 33 years of age. It finally clicked for me after thinking I found the field I want to be working in, and then experiencing the same office politics and toxicity  happening all over again. I went too hard in the first 6 months, now all hard work got me was more work I can't keep up with, and the boss is actively letting me drown and fail,  but won't let me go because I actually can do the job properly, and 5 senior people have left already within 2 years.\nNow I go in and do what I can do in my day, no above and beyond, no overtime, no special requests, nothing. \nIf something doesn't get done, it really doesn't matter, it's all fake deadlines and no real emergencies, it's freaking paperwork, not someone getting heart surgery.', a user said: 'Good on you for opening your eyes but\nNow I go in and do what I can do in my day, no above and beyond\nYa thats already too much. I guaran-fucking-tee youll get away with doing less without any repercussions because your coworkers are already doing exactly that.\nAt my job I'm a lazy worker but not the worst, I stretch 2-3 hours of work over 8 and my bosses love me because I smile and tell them what they wanna hear.\nI always laugh when i watch my coworkers taking pride in how much more productive they are than me for the same paycheck.'"
