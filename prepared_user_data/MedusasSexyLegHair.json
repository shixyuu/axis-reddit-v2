They think they can treat people how they want and you’re not going anywhere. If you don’t bend over backwards for them, they will do a lot more to accommodate you.', a user said: 'Yeah, basics of negotiation.  If you act like you deserve stuff, you're much more likely to get it than if you act like you don't deserve it and are lucky to have whatever they give you.  It's good when your boss sees you more like an equal vs someone beneath them.'"
