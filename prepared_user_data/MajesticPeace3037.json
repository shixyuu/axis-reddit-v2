        "In response to 'middle management started to feel more and more useless.\nEveryone but middle management knew they were useless', a user said: 'I felt this, but I have respect for corporations that also stepped back, realized this, and gave middle management better pay, while not forcing them to babysit the rest of us.\nFor example, my job. Before I was hired in as a customer support rep my supervisor used to have to check in on us, watch our call times, review how we settled support tickets, etc. He also would take on the tickets that needed legal support and he would be exhausted. Meanwhile the turnover rates were stupid high because nobody wanted to be micromanaged to hell and back.\nOnce Covid hit, and everyone went remote, the company basically let anyone who wanted to work from home do so, downsized their office, and only have management really come in if it's necessary or for extra training.\nThey upped my supervisors pay, give him a nicer sounding title, and he still deals with our escalated or legal issue customer support tickets but it's easier for him to actually focus on those since he's not forced to watch and babysit the rest of us. Meanwhile I got hired in a while ago assuming this would be the chapter of my life where I'd hate everything due to basically being a wfh call center worker but...I'm allowed to take breaks as I need to, I get decent benefits, the pay is good for what I'm doing, and I was only micromanaged during my first month until a decent level of trust was built. My other few coworkers also let me know that since the micromanaging stopped they also upped our pay as an incentive to keep us honest and open and retain employees.\nI feel like if every company did this, things wouldn't be so bad, but some places just get a raging hard on off of belittling people and it's just depressing, sick, and twisted.'"
