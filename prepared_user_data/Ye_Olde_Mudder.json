        "In response to 'People who are studying HR? Maybe, I guess.  HR seems like a weird department to target here, but maybe I'm just used to working in a public education setting.  But in my experience, most HR professionals are just trying to\nhelp people apply/get jobs,\nunderstand their benefits once they get the job\nMake sure labor laws are being followed\nMake sure management understands those labor laws and doesn't say or do anything illegal.\nIn addition, in most government jobs, HR is also actively working to minimize the effects of systemic discrimination.\nSource: I teach at a community college and my wife (who has a BS in Biology, not HR) works in HR\nedit: at the same college', a user said: 'HR is not there to help anyone, ever.\nThey are the\nzampolits\nof the neoliberal system.  Usually people go into HR because they aren't really good at anything, and are generally useless.\nHR at my SO's place have lots of free time as they have fuckall to do, so they spend their time finding ways to negatively impact people who are actually productive'"
