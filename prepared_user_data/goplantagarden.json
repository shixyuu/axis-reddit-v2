You get a new title and more responsibility. Unfortunately, we can’t get you more money… yet.” They would string people along for a year or two, not paying them what the role was worth. Saving a lot of money stealing from employees.\nSo yeah, “quiet quitting” sounds an awful lot like corporate boot licking propaganda.

I've seen multiple articles about this across social media feeds. I am a former marketer and I absolutely tagged this as a PR campaign 100%. We need to recognize these  bullshit stories for the manipulative corporate campaigns that they are.\nDo yourself a favor and delete your FB accounts and stop reading click-bait news online. These contributors are getting paid to make you feel bad about yourself.'"
