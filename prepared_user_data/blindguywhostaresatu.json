        "In response to 'Why is showing up doing what you need to do and going home such a bad thing? Lol\nI don't get this quiet quitting thing. You have a staff member working in the assigned position doing what they need. It's just about employers wanting to violate your boundaries', a user said: 'I actually got fired for this last week. A new sales manager was hired and had one on ones with the sales team. I let him know that this job isn’t my entire life and my family and life outside of work is my priority. I said I will do the job and I will do it well and make you money but I’m here to do a job and go home. He didn’t like that so a week later I was fired for “not a culture fit.”'"
