        "In response to 'I hate the word quiet quitting. Not going above and beyond for your work is not quiet quitting, it’s acting your wage and doing exactly what you’re paid to do.', a user said: 'Capitalism has bastardized labor into attaching a monetary value to someone's skill and time and then standardizing the rates regardless of them. It used to be that harder workers made more by either being more skilled or putting in more hours, now companies expect that but don't pay any more. They killed the incentive to work harder. Why wouldn't you \"quiet quit\" when your laziest work gets paid the same as your hardest work? Why wouldn't you when they penalize efficient workers with more work? It's the Capitalist snake eating it's own tail, trying to exploit the workers but really demoralizing them worse than not doing anything.'"
