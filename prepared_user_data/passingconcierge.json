        "In response to 'It isn't really work to rule.\nAs the bare minimum you can do is probably far less than your job description. I can think of any number of people where if you don't asked them 3 times it isn't getting done, one of the people seems to be expecting me to stand next to them while they did it.\nWFH killed the 9-5 job and often people were doing more hours or odd hours, they realise it was pointless as extra effort got them nothing.', a user said: 'It isn't really work to rule.\nIt is work to rule. The Contract gives the terms and conditions for the exchange and work to rule sticks to exactly that. If you believe someone is failing to do their job: fire them. No ifs. No buts. Just do it. That includes you. Because if you fire someone because you cannot correctly instruct them to do what they are contractually obliged to do then you are a poor manager and unable to do your job and, so, obviously, deserve to be fired.'"
