        "In response to 'Original Post: CMV: \"Quiet quitting\" is not only hypocritical & nonsensical, but the very existence of the term marks a deplorably unequal economy. Recently, many major corporations have started to use the term \"quiet quitting\" to refer to employees whose productivity remains consistent, implying that not continuously increasing one's output at work is akin to stealthily quitting one's job. This is, to anyone who wasn't born into the top 0.5% and then went on to become a CEO who never worked a job below $60/hr in their life, a ridiculous idea. The entire point of working a job under a capitalist system is that you are exchanging your labor for a contractually agreed upon wage. While the tenets of capitalism fundamentally require that you be paid less than your work is worth to the company, this CMV doesn't aim to touch on the fundamental inequalities of capitalism, but rather the bastardization of the capitalist system that Westerners in 2023 are forced to face.\nWhen a laborer agrees to work for an employer for a wage, the principles of ideal capitalism dictate that the agreement between the laborer and employer is mutually beneficial: the laborer is happy performing the required labor in exchange for the offered compensation, and the employer is happy reaping the profits of said labor in exchange for paying said compensation.\nEvery single nation employing this style of capitalism also uses fiat currency: currency which is inherently inflationary and will always reduce in value (at varying rates, but always tending towards a reduction in currency value through inflation). In the US, the proprietor of the global reserve currency and the most influential capitalist republic in a world brimming with capitalist republics, the rate of inflation has significantly exceeded the rate of wage increase for over a year now; that's not including the even further blown-out cost-of-living skyrocket nor the record-breaking strides in the efficiency of labor thanks to technology.\nIt has been shown time and time again that, while the economic stagnation brought on by the pandemic surely did inhibit the global economy, more than half of the increase in both inflation and cost-of-living in advanced Western economies has been solely due to greed-driven exploitation of global unrest by corporations who have posted record profits despite devastating drops in demand through pure price gouging and exploitation.\nThe use of the term \"quiet quitting\" betrays the not-so-secret key to maintaining profitability for shareholders despite negative economic trends: employers have always expected workers to sacrifice whatever necessary in their own lives for the increased profits of their already exorbitantly wealthy shareholders. For the past few decades of increased productivity and prosperity, this has been fueled by laborers' belief that hard work and blind dedication will result in financial advantages: work hard, provide more value to your company, and you get paid more: capitalism at work. Except now, we live in a world where even the most generous of incentivized bonuses still amount to a reduction in wages according to purchasing power.\nIf your wage is not actively adjusted for inflation, you are taking on a recurrent decrease in salary.\nTL;DR a laborer under a functioning capitalist society exchanges an agreed-upon quantity of labor for an agreed-upon wage. The economy under which most of the Western world currently exists has become vastly preferential of business owners and corporate elite through pure corruption, and the idea of \"quiet quitting\" is just a small yet potent example of how the wealthy have been actively and increasingly exploiting the working class for decades, inevitably trending towards record-breaking profits for the top 1% regardless of wider economic factors, and a consistent degradation of the wage, purchasing power, and political representation of the workers actually creating value.\nPlease change my view because, as a highly politically and economically educated person who was born into a problematically socialist society and raised in another, now living in the US, I desperately want to be able to support the widespread prosperity afforded under a capitalist system, but the US has already easily passed the threshold from capitalism to oligarchy.\nAs an immigrant US resident who believes in this country but can't vote, I desperately remind Americans that you're allowed to vote for someone who isn't a corrupt geriatric billionaire - please just stop watching CNN, FOX, and MSNBC, and maybe actually read a campaign platform or two. You have competent politicians, you just refuse to give them power for some reason...', a user said: 'It seems like you have a misunderstanding of what quiet quitting is.  It isn't that productivity is steady, it is instead that the minimum effort is put forth so as to skirt the line between being fired and holding onto your job.  Generally speaking you see a loss in productivity, not a maintaining of productivity.  For example, you are given a deadline of 4 weeks for a project.  In reality, you could complete it in 1 week by putting in extra hours, normally you'd complete it in 2 weeks without extra hours, but in a quiet quitting scenario you'd wait until the day it is due to finish, waiting the full 4 weeks.\nSo your initial assumption is based on a false premise.\nNow for the rest of your weird statements.\ninevitably trending towards record-breaking profits for the top 1% regardless of wider economic factors\nThe only way you can call profits record breaking is if you look at them in raw dollar value.  Which, if you are economically educated, makes absolutely no sense.  Profits are records nearly every year in a healthy company because inflation creeps up every year.  When you look at the profits of these companies in the way that every single economist and financial person does, you see a decrease in profitability.  Yes that company that sold 1 billion in goods made 100 million in profit last year, but they made 90 million on 800 million in sales the year.  It's a record profit!  But the percent of profit made was less.  As we look through the economy you see this more and more.\na laborer under a functioning capitalist society exchanges an agreed-upon quantity of labor for an agreed-upon wage\nThis isn't really true unless you are contractually obliged to such a thing.  For example, a cashier at a store will inevitably have downtime, so their labor isn't being utilized but they are being paid for a such a time.  Conversely a construction worker may agree upon a contract that they spend 1000 hours building something but due to an unforeseen issue or complication they end up spending 1200 hours instead.  They don't get to bill for additional hours unless you agree upon that first.  Labor is not a quantity to wage driven process.\nand a consistent degradation of the wage, purchasing power\nI'm not entirely sure what you think this means, but wages have trended up, not down.  Purchasing power has changed, not degraded as well.  The only way you can come to these conclusions is by using bad data points.  For example, the purchasing power of someone in 2023 would include things that someone in 2010 did not.  Streaming subscriptions, for example.  The problem with purchasing power charts is that it makes no distinction for how the costs of people have modified over time.  Someone in the 90's would be amazed at not just the fact that we carry a computer in our pocket that has access to the internet at speeds faster than they ever did, but that those devices cost over a thousand dollars a piece.  Similarly, wages can only been seen as degrading if you look at the same job over time.  The value of many types of labor goes down as advancements in technology go forward.  We do not bemoan the stagecoach driver being a job with no wage potential with the advent of the car.  But today we do that all the time with things like automated order taking reducing the number of people needed thus decreasing the wages required for such a position.  Likewise tools which a carpenter or plumber uses have increased productivity requiring us to need less and less of their labor.\nmaybe actually read a campaign platform or two\nUgh, probably your worst argument.  Campaign platforms are the most useless, generic items that a politician puts out.  They have very little bearing on what they actually end up doing.  For example, if we listened to the platforms of republicans, we'd see them in favor of small government and responsible budgets.  In reality, we see neither.  If we listened to democrats we'd hear about the need for data driven spending and responsible budgets.   In reality, we see neither.  There's a reason that the joke in the US goes \"How do you know when a politician is lying?  His lips are moving\".\nYou have competent politicians, you just refuse to give them power for some reason...\nThe problem here is that there is no such thing as a competent politician.  I would also imagine that the ones you think are competent wouldn't actually address any of the things you want them to.  You seem to understand that in a capitalist society there is widespread prosperity to be had, but then you want politicians to do what?  Enact the policies that you fled from?  That is a great way to squash that prosperity.\nSome part thoughts to ponder on before you reply.\nIn the US, generational wealth, isn't a thing.  70% of all wealth is lost by the second generation and\n90% is lost by the third\n.  The idea that someone being wealthy means that you family is set for life is a poor one.\nIf you look at IRS data, you see that someone in the bottom 25% of income almost always has moved out of that bracket within a decade.  We have very recently had a skewed system in which more young people stayed in college, many for more than the 4 years for a degree, skewing age based statistics about what age you should acquire wealth at.  Previous generations didn't attend college at nearly the numbers todays youth did meaning when you compare average wealth at 25 today versus 50 years ago, there will be a vast difference.\nA large summation of everything I've said can boil down to, you've been lied to using statistics to manipulate you.  But when you boil the data down into usable data, none of the things you hold dear are true.  You read the headline of a news article from someone who didn't understand the study conducted and believed them.  When in reality, the data shows a much much different picture.'",

So they compounded their problem by printing off more dollars to chase the same amount of goods and then using a trading currency that is doing the same.\nI am unsure why anyone thinks that inflation is a supply issue of anything but dollars.'",
        "In response to 'Because inflation can be caused by low supply. This is well established. It's also pretty well established that we are in a time of low supply for many things. So it's about as reasonable as saying printing money caused inflation. I don't know enough about economics to know why one is more a cause than the other but acting like supply shortage couldn't cause inflation is ridiculous', a user said: 'Because inflation can be caused by low supply. This is well established.\nIt most certainly is not.  Inflation is about the amount of dollars chasing goods, not about the goods themselves.  When technology improved and the cost of flat screen TVs went down, we didn't call that deflationary, because it isn't.  The natural increase of the price of goods isn't what inflation is.  That is established.\nSo it's about as reasonable as saying printing money caused inflation.\nWhich is incorrect.  Inflation is explicitly the amount of money chasing the same amount of goods.  We have massively increased our monetary supply chasing the same number of goods.\nI don't know enough about economics to know why one is more a cause than the other but acting like supply shortage couldn't cause inflation is ridiculous\nYou don't know enough to tell me why, but you speak as an authority to tell me that it is?'",
        "In response to 'While that\nmight\nbe the technical definition, especially in the ludicrously stupid \"don't bother me with facts, just theory\" Austrian Economics movement, that's not how it's perceived, and more importantly\nit's not how it's measured\n.\nThe\nmeasure\nof \"inflation\" is \"prices increased year over year\", nothing more, and nothing less. People that want to turn this into metaphysics are just being obtuse.\nAnd it's\nabsolutely\ntrue that reduced supply, especially with inelastic demand, can and does increase\nprices\n. Indeed, that's the entire basis of supply and demand economics.\nInsisting it's not \"actually inflation\" because it doesn't fit a useless definition that is politically motivated really is not helpful.\nIt's absolutely \"inflation\" by every measure that's actually used.', a user said: 'especially in the ludicrously stupid \"don't bother me with facts, just theory\" Austrian Economics movement\nIf you're going to come out being insulting then I don't know why you would expect anyone to engage with you\nAnd you're a mod.  I expected more.'"
