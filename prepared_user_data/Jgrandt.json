        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! 🙏', a user said: 'I’ve always been known as being a very hard worker who takes great pride in his work and is always ready to help anyone for anything. I don’t know why I’m built that way, but it would cause people to say, “wow, someone’s trying to get promoted”, and that wasn’t the case at all. Not so say I would not want a promotion, but that wasn’t my motivation.\nIn the past several years I have been lied to and misled regarding raises and such, and I have lost that part of me that enjoys helping others and now I don’t want to do anything extra at all for anyone. I’ve been dicked over so many times and so hard that I lost my spark.\nIt’s hard to quiet quit when there is that ambiguous phrase, “and any task as assigned” in the job description. It’s a little blank spot for them to put absolutely anything. And they did. From weeding to office cleaning to drywalling to roofing repair, you name it, if they didn’t want to spend money on a professional, just have Jonathan do it. Can you really say no? When I pushed back a couple times I was met with anger and comments like, “I just want to make sure you don’t lose your job, so I give you extra work to make you more valuable.”\nPerhaps my willingness early on is how I set myself up to be taken advantage of.\nWell anyway… I don’t know if you can ever really quiet quit without being caught unless you go about it very gradually. Yet if someone notices, screw them. They are just acknowledging now that they underpaid a great worker and are gonna have a problem with it? Screw them, man!'"
