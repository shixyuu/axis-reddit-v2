        "In response to 'Quiet quitting is a translation of the lying flat movement in Asia. It’s giving boundaries to work and not allowing work to take more of your life than you are willing. To abusers who don’t understand boundaries it looks like not doing enough. To people who work for a living it means having their mental and physical time back to live their life.', a user said: 'Some how the lying flat turned into this sentiment, but originally was different.\nIt started when a guy released a manifesto on Baidu about being jobless for 2 years and the virtues of not working at all in the rat race.\nHe even spoke about Diogenes being homeless etc\nSame thing with quite quiting. It's also turned into this thing of not engaging in self sacrifice at work, but it's literally doing the bare minimum or not even doing the job at all.\nMuch like people in government will just stop working altogether and take 6 months to get fired.'",
