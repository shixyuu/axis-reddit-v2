        "In response to 'Original Post: How to quiet quit without being detected after being known to be an extra-mile person at work? Firstly, I know - quiet quitting is just doing your job and nothing extra. Stop repeating the chant.\nSecond, I was known to be THAT person, who goes out of his way to help. I guess I associated my self worth with how company values me.\nIt took a couple of a years and being passed over a promotion to wake up.\nI cannot quit at the moment, or change jobs, I have been looking and nothing suitable on the horizon yet.\nThe question is how do I make the shift in attitude without getting so much attention especially that I am known to be a hard worker.\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very useful tips! Read every single one! üôè', a user said: 'Remember: You're always busy.   Don't say no to projects or requests.    Give them time frames that they probably won't like.\n\"\nI can start on it next Wednesday,  and I should have it done in two weeks\n\".    Or \"\nI can start on it in two days but I will need to put xyz project on hold for the entire time\n. \"\nWhenever a new project or assignment comes up for the team,  always remind  management of  time constraints due to other projects and work, and  a suggest more reasonable time frames.'",
        "In response to 'What if deadlines are given but the project at hand will require more time?', a user said: 'That's when people need to push back hard such as \"\nThat's a  72 manhour project you want completed over the next 3 weeks.  I can free up 10 hours per week.  If I put XYZ on hold for the next 3 weeks,  I can get it done in that time.\n\"'"
