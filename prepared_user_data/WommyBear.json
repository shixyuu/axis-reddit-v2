        "In response to 'It is. But getting literally no acknowledgement at all, after one of the most difficult years of teaching, was a huge slap in the face.', a user said: 'In the 2020-2021 school year, my (then) school assigned at least one virtual teacher per grade level. It was incredibly difficult because none of us knew what we were doing, had terrible parents, and had to go to the building with children present because they didn't trust us to do our job.\nThe teachers who weren't virtual had to come to school with children (no vaccines yet), had extra cleaning duties, has to post all work online in case of covid absences, and had to go back and forth between in-person and virtual learning, depending on how many cases there were.\nAdmin gave the instructional coach the Teacher of the Year award, the one person who had the easiest (not easy) job that year. We were PISSED.'"
