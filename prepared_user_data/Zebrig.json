        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'So you are basically asking what reddit thinks of just doing the job we are paid for?\nAnd not go beyond the parameters set for what we are paid?\nThat you do the job you are paid, in the hours you are paid to do it?\nI tink that is where everyone should be, the thing about extra hours (sometime not paid), extra responsability and extra work is that usually it is not \"rewarded\", ya the boss can pay you a bit more, but then if something happens and you have to stop it you are the bad person.'"
