You'll have them leaving all their work for you to do as they go to smear you with the management for laziness and fucking up.  They'll sit around and talk all day but you'll be the lazy fuckup because enough unified dumbasses can control the narrative in a \"good old boys club\".\n​\nIt's a very strong unspoken rule amongst rednecks that you're never supposed to be \"smarter than your station\".  They'll absolutely love you if you always play one notch dumber than they are.\n​\nDon't crack out books, don't talk philosophy, psychology, or history.  Never disagree with the right wing fundamentalist talking points.  And if you really want them to love you, act interested in Jesus.', a user said: 'Don't crack out books, don't talk philosophy, psychology, or history.

And if you really want them to love you, act interested in Jesus.\nSee, I'll never pretend what I'm not for the acceptance of people I'm only forced to be around at certain hours of the day. I'd rather just find a different job.'"
