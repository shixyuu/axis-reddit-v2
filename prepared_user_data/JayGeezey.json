        "In response to 'Original Post: Absolutely unhinged response to a post supporting employees that do \"quiet quitting\" [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/934fs89cs1o91.png', a user said: 'Obviously there is a lot of flawed logic here, but I think my favorite is one they display pretty much upfront -\nand this seems to be what id call a logical fallacy, though I'm sure it's technically not one, but he says [paraphrasing] men have worked and been overworked for all of human history\", this demonstrates and erroneous way of thinking that is surprisingly somewhat common - that if something has been done a certain way forever, or for a long time, then it is objectively the right and best way to do something.\nIt blows my mind. In my opinion, anything and everything can always be done better and improved. It's especially funny, because people like this will say \"of course slavery is bad\", but based off the logic they constantly spew - if they were around during the Civil War, it seems likely they'd argue against outlawing slavery. I mean, \"it's something that's been practiced for all of human history\", right Peter? ;-)'"
