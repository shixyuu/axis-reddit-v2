        "In response to 'Original Post: How to Approach Annual Review After I Quiet Quit Almost a year ago, my boss pulled some power move BS and I made two changes as a result: I took work email off my phone and stopped working more than the expected hours. No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a \"good idea fairy\" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't.\nMy boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise.\nSo now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the \"extra\" stuff has fallen away.\nIt will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?\nFWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years. Thanks!!', a user said: 'You could be the person hired to replace me.  I left for other reasons.  My boss was pretty ADD .   Trust me, if they loose track of daily, weekly things then they will not notice one year to the next.\nHere are some tips-  keep it as visually similar as last year and as other people's too.\nIf you have a set time for review, like 30 minutes, then have some Red Ball Topics.  Walk in and start asking about something they like, and event, food, anything they like. Soak up some time with that.\nYou do not have to answer a question.  Practice this.  Hey you, what did you have for lunch?  Reply- oh my gosh, did you see the lines in the new lunch place? Have you eaten there yet? If you don't like the conversation change the topic.\nAre they getting too close to a topic you want to avoid?  Drop something and after you pick it up then immediately change the subject/ deflect/ give non answer.\nNew check your watch but have a way to know when time is up.  Or a little early with a lot g happy good bye.'"
