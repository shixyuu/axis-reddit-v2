        "In response to 'Exactly. Unless it's literally your own business, or you earn bonus/commission based on how much you produce, there is almost 0 incentive to work harder/longer/through lunch/etc. Chances are, you're just gonna get more work for the same pay, and you won't get any promotions if you're good at your job because the company wants to keep you right where you are.', a user said: 'On top of that, the company has no incentive to hire anyone else to alleviate the workload. Even if you have a good boss who might understand they are short staffed, if the employees are willing to work for free, it could be harder for a boss to fill vacant positions since the work is getting done. The higher ups just want the work to be done for the least amount of money so more goes to them.'"
