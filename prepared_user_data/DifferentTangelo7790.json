Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'If you didnâ€™t call the customer, you failed. DoorDash instructs you to call the customer if they donâ€™t answer your textsâ€¦ if they ignore your call then it is okay to refund items/cancel the order. Although I am annoyed when customer donâ€™t respond to me, you have to have a little human empathy. Oftentimes, people order delivery because theyâ€™re busy and/or unableâ€¦ not always lazy.'"
