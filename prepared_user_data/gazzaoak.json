        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting just to do ur task sounds fucking weird…\nMy boss wants u to take ur half hour break, even if ur working less than 5 hours…. If ur noticeably visibly sick he will send u to the work paramedics and work paramedics will most likely send u home or hospitals….'"
