Simply put, the more work you do, the more work they give you and since you're only human, you're bound to either make a mistake or fall behind on some of it, which then makes it your responsibility and you look like someone who's slacking off.\nHowever, if you're someone who only does the bare minimum, you are less likely to do the above and finish your work and will have ample time to do it as well, making you look more efficient at it.\nThis would cause them to look at you like you're a \"good worker\".\nFunnily enough, the corporations actually want the first kind, the type who does multiple things, so they only have to pay one man for a 10 man job. But, they will still reward and promote the scummy low input worker who is good at office politics, because they appear more \"efficient\" and they know that this is the guy who will be great at low input jobs like the ones at the top (managerial and above).\nMeanwhile, the 'worker bee' is \"good at where he is\", so no need to promote him.\nKeep this in mind, the next time you feel like working extra hard anywhere.\nUnless that work culture changes, this will keep happening and hard workers will always be punished.'"
