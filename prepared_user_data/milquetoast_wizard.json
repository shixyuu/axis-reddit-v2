This is just a way for the people in power to blame employees for becoming disengaged when they don’t get paid enough to do the same monotonous shit every day.'",
        "In response to 'I don’t even think it’s always about money. Some jobs are just soul crushing and some work places are just depressing. It’s certainly better if it pays well, but that’s not going to be enough to be enthusiastic about spreadsheets in a cubicle.', a user said: 'Agreed. My point was mainly that making up a new word for this is an attempt to put the onus of disengagement / burnout on the employee. “It’s your fault for feeling that way and you need to do better” when in reality its the the company and employer that is creating a toxic work environment that breeds this apathy.'"
