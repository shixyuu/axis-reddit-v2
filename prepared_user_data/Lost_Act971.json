        "In response to 'If a member of my staff had posted that, Is give them two options:\n- delete that and write another post about how mistaken you were.\nOr\n- quit/be fired.\nI normally wouldn't care what someone does on their social media. But the fact that they're announcing their employer through the title attached to their profile, makes it detrimental to the business. Even beyond how stupid his take on women in the workplace is, he's such an idiot.', a user said: 'This behavior continues to mystify me.  Every corporate employer I’ve worked for in the past…at least 10 years has had some form of social media policy that would almost certainly address this kind of garbage being spouted with their name attached.  I’ve never gone off like this on LinkedIn, a careful reading of my post history would be a couple of “interesting” announcements from my former employer and lots of “Congratulations” comments for work anniversaries or promotions/job changes…like as neutral as I can keep it honestly.  Do these people not know how visible this shit is or do they just not care?  It’s unreal.'"
