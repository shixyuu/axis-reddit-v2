        "In response to 'I agree about them being shallow. You can never have an honest, open, and deep conversation with any \"close\" JW friend for fear of saying something that they'll feel obligated to report to the elders. I contrast that with my former Navy shipmates who I can talk to about anything and know it stays between us and who'll offer sincere advice and help.', a user said: 'So true'",
        "In response to 'For honest and kind hearted  JWs:\nStop donating with your hard earned money as well.\nWatchtower will survive for a long time even without your donation. They have investments like stocks, bonds, real estate properties. As you can see they have hundreds of millions of projects after projects around the globe. They use free labors and benefits from tax exemptions which they leverage for more profits when they sell these properties that they developed.', a user said: 'CSA'",
        "In response to 'I chose to fade, I'm not playing by their idiotic rules anymore so why should I write a letter to them or even call. They certainly forgot all about me with the quickness once I became disabled and had to use the phone hook- up pre pandemic. That made fading extremely easy and I no longer have anyone still in the cult, so it turned out to be lucky.', a user said: 'Don’t write a letter. That’s obeying their rules.'",
        "In response to 'I did it cause I didn't want my name associated with pedophile hiding twatwaffles. Many reasons to write a letter then obeying their rules.', a user said: 'I see'",
        "In response to 'What I don’t understand is that they say they are growing. But in my area they are shutting down and combining kingdom halls, because congregations are so small.', a user said: 'That what I was thinking. They wanted to twist that to boost attendance stats. Cram three congregations into one. Maybe it’s full.\nThey believe their lies.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Is Quiet Quitting now a thing for Jehovah's Witnesses? So many posts here related to Memorial Season for the Jehovah's Witnesses Organization make me feel like many \"active\" JWs are simply engaging in Quiet Quitting. These JWs are not DA, DF'D or PIMO even but they are just doing less....not showing up for in-person activity....not very engaged as a JW anymore. It is great to see this and the growth of this EXJW Sub too.\nReally the most effective thing that can be done to damage the harmful Jehovah's Witness Organization is to simply stop supporting it with your time or energy. Stop volunteering, stop showing up at as many meetings, stop participating if you can.', a user said: 'Oh ya quietly quit about 10 years ago'"
