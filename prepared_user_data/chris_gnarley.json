        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'I don’t get how tf they infer that someone is quitting because they’re doing the bare minimum? I’ve done that my whole life and never had anyone think I was quitting. If someone wanted to quit, you’d see a dip in their performance of their bare minimum responsibilities or they’d just flat out leave.\n“How do you combat ‘quiet quitting’?”\nYou pay attention to your team and you be a proactive boss and try to establish a friendly connection with the employee and see if they have any concerns or things that are bothering them or suggestions for what could help them do their job better. Holy fuck.'"
