        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'I brought my youngest daughter to Paris for the Olympics. She’s a young adult and the pace really bothered her. We had Olympics event tickets plus I wanted to see other sights such as Versailles, the catacombs, the louvre etc. there was also a 3 day side trip to Marseilles for more Olympics and a day in Monte Carlo. I felt like I was dragging her along and the final week told her that other than the Olympic events she could do her own thing. She slept late and met friends to hang out with. I’m always up early and go for a run and I’m ready to get the day started lol everyone is different. I am fine wherever I am and don’t get home sick. I check in at home every day and know all is in good order. My daughter missed her boyfriend, her cat and was going to start at a new job when we returned so she was anxious about that.'"
