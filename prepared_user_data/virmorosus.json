Your company pays for 8 hours as per the contract.\nIf you are down to a single admin your company needs to cave and hire someone on before disaster.\nIf they are asking for 120+ and you wont pay that, you should list the salary in the listing.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting is not a thing. Your company pays for 8 hours as per the contract.\nI wish more employers understood this. If you require 50 hours of work per week from an employee, then that’s a management problem, not an employee requirement.\nOP: Despite the Federal Reserve’s efforts to reduce the money supply and curb inflation, Congress and the President are intent on expanding it. 2023 is going to be more of the same.'"
