        "In response to 'Right? Still desperate to find people for my medical office… and we mainly attract younger women with no degrees who are strictly hourly. There’s no such thing as quiet quitting or reducing hours, it is what it is. We’ll hire and trains HS grads from scratch, or also happy to hire people with MA certificates or 2 year LPN degrees.\nProblem is, there aren’t as many women age 20-30 as there used to be.', a user said: 'Or your pay isn't competitive.'",
        "In response to 'What would you say a competitive salary would be to hire a new HS grad as a receptionist with no prior experience, in a medium COL Midwest city? Assume of course that full benefits and paid vacation etc are included.', a user said: 'You're not just competing with that job field though. You're competing with everyone that's hiring for other jobs that candidate is qualified for. If you're under $18 for example then Chik Fil A is probably beating you. Another factor is whether or not you advertise the pay in the job listing.\nRight now a quick look at indeed near me says receptionist labor is going for anywhere between $8 and $28 an hour. I'm guessing the $8 job isn't getting filled any time soon.\nUnless they have kids people under 26 year old don't really need benefits if they can stay on their parents plans so that's not really attracting them.'",
        "In response to 'Or it could be a combination of both. Demographic trends are real', a user said: 'Raise the pay and you'll get applicants. There's not a lot of jobs out there you can't get\nsomeone\nto do if the pay is right.\nOr even just advertise the pay. I know when I was job searching I didn't apply to any jobs that didn't advertise base pay in the job listing.'"
