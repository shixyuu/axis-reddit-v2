Is the watchtower study still an hour long?'",
        "In response to 'Public talk 30 min WT about an hour. Been like that for years.', a user said: 'Thanks, I left in late 1970s.'",
        "In response to 'Its a different religion now ,what you remembered has long gone .i recommend a look at the book \" my beloved religion and the governing body \" writers  name is Rolf  cant remember second name it like Fiorly.its available on pdf', a user said: 'Only started to look into JW on YouTube a few years ago and I can see that they've changed. I remember having lots of debates with elders and others, but in 74/75 when WT were screaming 1975 from assemblies and written in the WT, one elder kept saying remember it is written no man knows the day or hour, thank you Bob he's probably dead now. Then WT blamed the rank and file, well that was my first reg flag. Between the watchtower study and going out in service we'd sit in back room having lunch and great arguments aka discussions in those days and now we'll it's no more, and that Kingdom hall is no more - sold. You have to refer to the book of acceptable questions to ask if you don't want to be disfellowshiped.'",

        "In response to 'stop donating!\nI agree! I stopped long ago.\nI say stop volunteering or giving your time as the quickest way to make an impact since this is immediate. A lack of willing volunteers to provide free labor would crush the Jehovah's Witness organization. A lack of volunteers (especially males) is kryptonite for JWs as they would not be able to operate congregations.\nI believe that even if 100% of donations stopped tomorrow.....the Watchtower Corporations have a large enough war chest of funds to keep things running for years.\nBut at some point....an organization with no people working.....is no longer an organization.', a user said: 'Totally agree, plus it would use up a lot of their energy trying to get volunteers and the harder they try the more desperate they'll get and that will eventually show in more coercive methods.'"
