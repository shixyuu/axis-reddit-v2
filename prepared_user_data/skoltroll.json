        "In response to '“Quiet quitting” isn’t a thing. It’s called having a job, doing your work, and going home once you’re finished. This is an industry buzzword to make people out like they’re lazy because they won’t go above and beyond their job duties and refuse to do work without being properly compensated for it.\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/09/quiet-quitting-trend-employee-disengagement/671436/', a user said: 'Agreed. This new corporate media \"buzzword\" is complete bullshit designed to be passive-aggressive shaming.\n\"Quiet quitting\" encompasses everything for them, INCLUDING ON-CALL BECAUSE YOUR OVERLORDS HAVE EXPECTATIONS.\nDo your job. Go home. Come back and do it again. That's in no way a form of quitting.'",
        "In response to 'Exactly. Corporations are scared that workers are actually starting to take back some of the power in a totally lopsided power dynamic and they're trying to shame people into falling back in line.', a user said: 'I see it every day here. COMPETENT new employees are getting raises just so they don't leave. And they're not even asking.'"
