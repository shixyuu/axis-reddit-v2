        "In response to 'So True. COVID was the reason businesses finally allowed WFH, but once workers had it they understood they needed it for A LOT more than COVID. They needed it for their mental health; they needed it for a better work/life balance; they needed it to help take better of their kids; they need it to save money on unnecessary expenses; they needed it to avoid a pointless commute that wastes their time for no benefit for themselves. We live in the age of high speed internet and communication; a lot of work can be just as easily be done at home as it is in the office. Heck, reducing stress can actually BOOST productivity. Insisting people work in the office is more about control', a user said: 'Yeah, exactly. I worked in a group that allowed certain team members to work full time remote, but when I asked about it, they said it wasn't possible because I didn't have it as a hiring condition, and that about the only exception would be if I had to care for a seriously ill family member. Even when Covid hit and we were all remote for a year, they kept talking about wanting to bring us back into the office. It was only when they started noticing how the attrition rate was spiking (because we're in a high demand field even before all this), that they changed their tune. I think about half the team went fully remote after that, with maybe a quarter to a third staying office based.\nAnd I'm not going back - at this point I've moved across the country (to the literal opposite coast). I'd rather find a new job because even if they insisted on me moving I could demand relocation costs.'"
