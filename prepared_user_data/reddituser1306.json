        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I've quiet quit for 2 years now in the hope of getting a very lucrative redundancy, my idiot employer just gave me a $25k salary increase. I literally can't believe it, not sure what else I need to do to make myself look redundant, but the payout just got bigger regardless I suppose.'"
