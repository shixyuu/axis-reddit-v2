What program is it that shows activity? You mentioned a green active icon which makes me think Teams, but Teams doesn’t display activity history to regular users (maybe superpower IT users).\nIt’s a messy situation, to say the least. If you have a strong relationship with the second-line manager or HR, there might be a potential pathway forward, but the situation is too nuanced for anyone to offer truly actionable advice.', a user said: 'Not necessarily the case but anything like Salesforce will have user engagement on it where you can see when records were updated or made etc.'",
        "In response to 'For sure. But SF last updated/modified records wouldn’t have the level of detail indicated in the post (OP and some colleagues logging 9 hours per day and the other person in question less than 4). Not saying there isn’t software that tracks this data, just seems like all sorts of data privacy landmines to share this information with every employee in a company and not management and above.', a user said: 'You would be able to glean it from first and last of the day if everyone else on a team was making updates for 9 hours and one was basically only doing updates from 10 to 2'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Yeah it's not super precise but being in IT I can generally tell who is and isn't engaging in systems if I check Oauth reports or something. It's less of a smoking gun and more of a way to get yourself on a list you don't want to be on.'"
