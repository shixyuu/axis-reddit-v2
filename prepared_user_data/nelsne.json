        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting: Employees suffering pandemic burnout say they've just stopped working as hard [External Link]: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/08/14/what-is-quiet-quitting/10304956002/', a user said: 'It's no surprise really. First a pandemic comes and we can't see our loved ones and have social distance for 2 years. Then we have no time to recover mentally from that and then rent prices skyrocket, gas prices skyrocket, and food prices skyrocket. So after you just got through the turmoil of COVID now you can't afford jack shit because everything is so expensive. Many people just can't handle all of this mentally. The American workforce has turned into \"The Hunger Games\". It's a dystopian \"survival of the fittest now\".'"
