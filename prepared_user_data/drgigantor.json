Some shit is too much for my pride, that ended up being a summer job.', a user said: 'Fucking what? I once mopped a wall in a very fancy hotel because this bitchy micro manager (who wasn't even in my department) gave me the \"time to lean time to clean\" line then told me to mop. I told her I already mopped the floor so she said, and I quote, \"Then mop something else.\"\n\"YeS mA'aM!\"\nWe were both reprimanded that day.'"
