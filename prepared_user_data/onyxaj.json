        "In response to 'Well this comment is thought provoking.  I’ve been very unhappy in my job for a while.  I don’t want to go out in flames though, and suspect that might be coming.  I will do some deep thinking about what my coping abilities and limits are - so thanks for that.', a user said: 'I've been there. Worked a help desk for 7 years, and there were days when I considered eating a bullet. Something finally came along that I didn't hate. Now a few years and 1000 miles later, I have a job I enjoy.\nBest advice I can give is update your resume, and put it out there. Put it on Monster and start looking on every job site available. Even of you feel under qualified, apply. You never know if they are looking for a \"junior\" in that position or someone to train from the ground up.'"
