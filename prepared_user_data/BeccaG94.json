        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I don't call it quiet quitting, I call it just doing my job. As a rule, in the 6 or so years that I've been working I've never worked beyond my regular hours (without at least claiming TOIL according to company policy) and I've always been strict about my remit. I just see it as having an ounce of self-respect.'"
