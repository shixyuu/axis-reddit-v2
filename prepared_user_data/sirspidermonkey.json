        "In response to 'People who get smart stop working as hard. Then there are people who get better at their jobs and therefore stop working as hard. Also people, who WFH and avoid all the office drama and other destructive bulls#it, find they get things done without working as hard.', a user said: 'People who get smart stop working as hard\nLearned that lesson early in my career. Sadly, I kept forgetting it starting out.\nWould get the \"Cost of living\" increase of 2% every year. More than many get, but was not matching what I saw in the store.\nBusted my ass, 80 hour weeks. Leading multiple projects. Would get an A+ review and a ... 4% raise.  I mean, it'd double the previous year but again but at best matched the price of a gallon of milk.\nSo I did the math. Looked at all the extra work outside 40 hours I was putting in. Divided it by the extra 2% (exceptional raise - normal raise) and found out that I was getting less than minimum wage for those extra hours.\nAnd before someone chimes in. Yes, I did bust my ass and got a 'raise' that basically made up for the cost of living misses I had before.\nAnd yeah, I did end up changing jobs. And that's only way to get a real raise but you are also a bit limited in how often you do it. (can't do it every 6 months typically forever)'"
