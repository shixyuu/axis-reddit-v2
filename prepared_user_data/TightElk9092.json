For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'I don’t understand why people act like doing what’s asked of you and leaving on time is some revolutionary, rebellious, controversial thing to do, as if doing 100% of what you’re being paid for could somehow make you a bad employee. This is all I’ve ever done at jobs because it’s just what’s natural to do if you haven’t been brainwashed into believing you should do differently'"
