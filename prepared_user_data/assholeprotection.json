        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'Yes! I don’t get paid until we get materials and project is completed. It can be 6 months til I get paid for the commission. As you know materials aren’t getting easier to get. I get hit with a 3 month  delay time with no warning constantly. Then I have to tell customer who’s mad they have to wait even longer for us to start. It causes a lot of problems with customer relations.\nCan’t predict which materials to purchase well enough to avoid, my vendor has been wrong multiple times because the manufacturers are always changing their lead times.'"
