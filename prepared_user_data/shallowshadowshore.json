        "In response to 'Original Post: I've been \"quiet quitting \" for a week and have never been more relaxed. I work in a high stress medical setting and have been for 8 years now. I've always been talk to go above and beyond for work. Over the last 4  years I've been increasingly burnt out and my paychecks do not seem to match my effort.\nHowever this past week, after a particularly nasty mental breakdown a few weeks ago, I've been doing the bare job requirements and it's been lovely. I now feel like I have more energy for my life outside of work, and more energy to further myself personally.\nRemember it's only a job, do what you have to and clock out.\n***edit: as many have said it's \"acting my wage\" I was using \"quiet quitting \" ironically', a user said: 'Serious question - do you not worry about losing your job? I would like to do this, but I’m pretty sure I would be canned in an instant.'",
        "In response to 'If doing just your job would result in your losing your job you should have a serious look at what your job actually is.', a user said: 'In theory, sure. In reality, with the job market as awful as it is right now, I’m hesitant to fuck around and find out.\nFrom the company’s perspective, there are probably thousands of people who would apply for my job tomorrow if it were posted, and most/all of those people would be willing and able to go “above and beyond” the bare minimum requirements to keep the job. So why would the company keep someone who is doing less for the same price?'"
