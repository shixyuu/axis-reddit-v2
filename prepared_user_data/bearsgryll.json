        "In response to 'Closing your laptop at 5 p.m. Doing only your assigned tasks. Spending more time with family. These are just some of the common examples used to define the latest workplace trend of \"quiet quitting.\"\nSome experts say it's a misnomer and should really be defined as carving out time to take care of yourself.\nI suspect a lot of us do this from time to time. Pick a slow week and just put in your 40 and turn work off in the evenings and weekends. Seems healthy to me.', a user said: 'It is preposterous to call shutting your laptop at the end of the day and spending time with your family “quiet quiting”. We should not be looking for a term like “quiet quiting” to describe what should be widely considered normal healthy and fair behavior. We should be looking for terms to describe this toxic culture where 50-80 hour work weeks are seen as okay.'"
