        "In response to 'Original Post: [The Philippine Star] \"Quiet quitting\" is taking over the workplace â€“ what exactly does it mean? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'I actually agree with this kind of culture. Employers tend to abuse their power and leave their subordinates with piled up workloads with little amount of pay. This kind of culture would open their eyes to treat their employees in a humane way and compensate them based on the amount of effort and work they put in their job. In addition, this would give employees time for themselves and with their family. We should embrace a culture of working to live and not the other way around, because if we do then it's as though we are merely existing to be slaves and not to enjoy life as we should.'"
