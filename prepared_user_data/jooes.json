        "In response to 'I interpreted the phrase as a worker-side term for the strategy of \"not quitting but also not putting in any energy anymore either while looking for another job\".\nI never came across one of those articles but don't see how this could be spun in favor of the employer.', a user said: 'That's what I thought too.\nOr when you stop doing your job entirely and you wait and see how long it takes for somebody to notice and fire you.\nIf you have an incompetent boss, you can probably go months by doing that.'",
        "In response to 'That's weird, I've never heard that definition before. I always thought it meant you stopped doing work without telling anybody, like Peter in Office Space.', a user said: 'Yeah, that's how I've always felt too.\nQuiet quitting should be when you don't want to work somewhere anymore, so you just stop doing your job and you wait and see how long it takes for your boss to actually notice and fire you. It's like quitting, but you still get a paycheck for as long as you last.\nAnd some people can last years too, which IMO says a lot about your bosses.'"
