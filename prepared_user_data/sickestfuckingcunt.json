        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'im fuckin burnt man. 3 new comp plans within the last year- in a similar situation to you where i won’t see commission for another 6 months+. making 55k salary with maybe $600 in “bonus” money each month just isn’t cutting it for me and it’s hard to stay motivated when you don’t feel like you’re being paid your worth.'",
        "In response to 'Oh man I was in just about the same salary range ($50K) and it was the most aggravating experience to see how many MILLIONS in reoccurring revenue I would pull in to the company, yet when I ask for $5,000-$10,000 raise so I could afford to rent a studio apartment, I was told \"$60K+ is above their salary range for the Inside Sales Rep  position.', a user said: 'haha it’s like we’re on the same team. maybe i’m wrong but i feel like the “inside sales” title is just used by companies to get account executive work without shelling out account executive pay. i try not to look at the numbers so much anymore because it kills me to know that my book of business has generated just shy of a million dollars this year and i’m only taking home crumbs. hopefully i can find something new by the end of the year.'"
