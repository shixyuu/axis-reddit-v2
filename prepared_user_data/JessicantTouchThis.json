        "In response to 'This is in the same vein as linecooks and servers that get mad when they close at 12:00 and an order comes in at 11:45. Yes, it is annoying as fuck. However where do you think your wages come from, sky daddie?\nIt‚Äôs super annoying and at the end of the day I never did like it but at the same time those people spending their money is how you are paid and that person isn‚Äôt technically doing anything wrong. If a restaurant says it‚Äôs open till 12 that means food can and will be served right up until 12. This won‚Äôt happen every single day but it will happen. Some people get outta work late and just want a meal when they get home. Others maybe were late getting there, you never really know.\nBeing mad you hate your job and taking it out on someone that has nothing to do with your job or your life chooses in general other than buying something and your the one picked to deliver it isn‚Äôt the way to go about this.', a user said: 'Yeah, my coworkers on the line were always less annoyed at the order coming in 15 minutes before close, but the fact that we worked at a sit down restaurant, and that table will now be here an hour past close.\nAnd the kitchen gets none of the tips despite doing all the work.\nAnd we can't leave until the check is dropped off, in case they want to order more food/dessert.\nAnd we now have to reclean all of the equipment we already shut down and had to fire back up for the table that\nhad\nto come in 15 minutes before close.\nAnd then tomorrow we're going to be bitched out by management/the owners for going into overtime and costing them more than they made from the table, but only the kitchen gets yelled at, the wait staff are praised for taking on that final table, we should\nnever\nturn a table away.\nThis Karen-level \"wElL iT's ThEiR jOb\" mentality needs to fucking die. We're human beings, not robots, we deserve common courtesy and respect just like customers expect from us. And we deserve a livable wage for our labor too, but we don't get that either, all while being told our jobs aren't \"skilled\" in any way.\nY'all are paying the absolute cheapest amount you can for literally every service, a cost that is borne by the underpaid and overworked employees, and then expect white glove personal service.\nIt's never fucking enough for y'all. I had a guy when I worked for USPS who lived less than 1/4 mile from the Post Office, had three cars, and worked from home. His front porch was a revolving door of packages every day: I'd drop 20 off, he'd have 20 sitting there for me to take. Every. Fucking. Day. Never a thank you, never an offer of water on a hot day, absolutely\nnothing\ndespite USPS not charging him (or anyone) for us to pick up their packages like that.\nThen a bin appeared: he wanted the packages put in the bin, to make it easier for him to carry them all inside... Then a sign telling me if it's raining, I need to bring the packages from the covered front porch to the covered back porch where there was more room... When I refused to do that, he added another sign telling me I need to put them all under the plastic bin if it's raining or going to rain... All while he's sitting on his ass inside in his pajama pants doing fuck all, or walking by the door eating potato chips while I'm unloading 40 fucking packages and picking up 40 more.\nWe're not your personal fucking servants, you want Express level delivery service, then pay Express shipping prices. You don't get Express service for Ground pricing, and y'all shouldn't be shaming delivery drivers for not going above and beyond when they're not being paid to.\nI constantly see posts on Reddit about people saying you should only give 80% or less at a job so you don't burn out, etc, and it's\nalways\nabout office jobs and how unreasonable it is for boss A to expect B for the pay, and so malicious compliance is warranted and you should slow down your work and blah blah blah, and everyone on Reddit praises them for not just rolling over and taking it.\nBut blue collar workers have enough and start to phone it in, well that's just unacceptable. Fucking hypocrites, all of you, you only care because it affects\nyou.'",
        "In response to 'He paid taxes for that service. Gotta get his money's worth.', a user said: 'USPS isn't funded by taxes, it's self-funded entirely by postage, PO Boxes, etc.\nSo no... His taxes weren't paying for that service, the postage rate he was paying (the lowest) was. And as I said, like everyone else who bitches about delivery companies: he wanted white glove personal service for pennies on the dollar.'",
        "In response to 'So I stopped at Karen level mentality lol. I‚Äôm not reading that rant. If you dislike that a place stays open till a certain time and customers come in before that certain time then talk to owners or management about a last call for kitchen. Or ya know, stop closing everything down a hour early.\nThere‚Äôs absolutely no way you cannot figure out how to close down partially or close down at least half the place while still being able to operate. Or communicate with your bar or servers. Hey all we have for the last hour is ‚Äúmost popular 3 items‚Äù and then close down the rest. Pick a different profession if your skins so thin a customer coming in to order food at a place that makes food makes you that upset.\nAnd as far as pay, simply because I seen ‚Äúyou all pay the lowest‚Äù as I skimmed trying to find the bottom of that long winded rant/story: I don‚Äôt control what wage you make and agreed to make when you took the job. I didn‚Äôt pay less than $20 a hour starting out with full free benefits, family meals, take home meals, PTO, 75% off drinks and my staff could order whatever from US foods and just pay out what the product cost them. So yeah, if I asked my crew to stay open and take orders up until the final minute they would without question. 9 times outta 5 I was right there with them or releasing them early myself and closing solo so they could go home.\nNot every manager is absolute dog shit. And if that‚Äôs what your use to well then the common factor there is you buddy.', a user said: 'So I stopped at Karen level mentality lol.\nI'm not reading anything you wrote if you won't read what I wrote. It's just going to be excuses for why you expect personal servants out of anyone who you feel is \"beneath\" you.\nThat's all it is, your last paragraph shows that with the first line of \"I don't control your pay,\" always a fucking excuse as to why the people at the bottom deserve nothing (empathy, understanding, humanity) because they're where they deserve.\nAgain, y'all don't want to pay shit, but expect everything on a silver platter. I'll be sure to start letting line cooks know their time is meaningless because\nu/throwitoutwhendone2\nhas determined customers always come first.\nIt's not the entitlement of the public feeling they can show up at close and expect full service, no no, it's the cooks for not appreciating that $40 meal that the business only made $10 off of saved the business from collapsing that month. üôÑ Bet your staff fucking hated working for you, and I can see why.'"
