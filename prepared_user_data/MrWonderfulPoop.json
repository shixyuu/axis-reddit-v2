        "In response to 'Original Post: How’s this for quiet quitting? I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'Companies use posts like this as an example to force RTO on everyone, quiet quitting or not.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah I’m sure they peruse the “Antiwork” subreddit and are shocked by people working the system. There’s NO way these companies would want people to RTO without Reddit posts. /s', a user said: 'I said they use “posts like this as an example”, not that they’re shocked and surprised.\nNot all of the sub’s  ~2.9 million members are quiet quitters. I’ve been WFH for over 12 years and love my job. You can be sure management and HR people also browse.\nPoint is, these types of examples simply add weight to their RTO arguments.'"
