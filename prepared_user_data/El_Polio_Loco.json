        "In response to 'It's also not a new idea by a long shot. \"Doing the minimum required to not get fired, while avoiding negative attention\" is an idea that every worker will figure out at some point. It's popular at almost every organization. It's popular with Gen X, it's popular with Millennials, it's popular with Zoomers.\nIf you're really looking to curb it not treating employees like a consumable resource helps as lot. As does giving them a stake in the outcome of the company with things like stock bonuses for all employees, employee unions, or coop employee ownership.', a user said: 'People don't \"figure it out\", they just come to the conclusion that the advantages of working harder are not worth it to them.\nThe big shift is that millenials/zoomers are more content in their lives, and also have been much more heavily supported by their parents, than previous generations.\nChasing the next big raise, promotion, working to get ahead, isn't as big of a deal to younger people anymore. And that's perfectly fine.\nIt manifests itself as a much lower level of self initiative with regard to advancement.'"
