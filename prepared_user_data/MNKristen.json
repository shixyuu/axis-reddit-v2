        "In response to 'Original Post: Minnesota among top 5 states for quiet quitting’ [External Link]: https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-quiet-quitting-jobs-2022', a user said: 'I’ve worked the equivalent of a week and a half over weekends this summer. I’ve pulled two all nighters at my job the last two months. All because we’re understaffed. It’s affecting my health. I finally went on vacation and decided I was done doing this. I still work over 40 hours a week. Don’t tell me I’m “quiet quitting” because I’ve stopped letting my job take advantage of me. I’ve basically missed this summer. It’s a hot job market right now for people in IT (especially in the Twin Cities) so there’s no reason for me to act like this is the only job out there and I have 20 mouths to feed. It isn’t, and I don’t.'"
