        "In response to 'Original Post: [The Philippine Star] \"Quiet quitting\" is taking over the workplace â€“ what exactly does it mean? [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/0rs7ss5twrj91.png', a user said: 'I'm not sure about the \"taking over\" but the government and some of their employees have been \"quiet quitting\" for a long time now.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah there's a lot to be said about our government but I find the performance and morale of government workers a complicated topic. Marami sa kanila ilang taon nang contractual tapos walang benefits. Minsan underpaid pa. Matagal bago taasan ang sahod. Kapit na lang for the job security.\nETA: Not saying government incompetence should be tolerated. I'm just pointing out that government workers can be victims of unfair labor practices, too.', a user said: 'Actually, yung masisipag sa government, yung mga contractual and waiting for a job order. Yung iba na matagal na sa serbisyo (hindi lahat) at regular na sa trabaho (hindi rin lahat) ay sobrang petiks at nag-aantay na lang ng alas singko.'",
        "In response to 'gov't employee here:\nminsan wala rin talagang pinapagawa ðŸ˜…\nI was courting someone early this year and I got so inspired to do my workloads. after 3 weeks, I was able to finish a 4 months worth of targets. At ayun, ilang buwan na akong nakatunganga. Kaya coursera tuloy pinagkakaabalahan ko. ðŸ˜Œ', a user said: 'I have friends in government offices rin. Some of them transferred from the private sector. Mas relax daw sa government. Haha.'",
        "In response to 'They aren't even working, sige security of tenure pa ðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'sarap na sarap sa job security and pension after retirement. but marami rin naman matino sa government, it's just the work culture in some offices suck that even yung matitino, nahahawa na rin.'"
