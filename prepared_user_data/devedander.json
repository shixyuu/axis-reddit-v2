Why don't you go to work and not do the job in your job description? Because you'd get fire.', a user said: 'This is what I say.\nWhen you sign up to be a cop you’re signing up for a dangerous job.\nIf you don’t want to be in danger, don’t take that job.\nI’m not a cop because I don’t want that kind of job.\nBut they clearly signed up for it. Do your job.\nRoughnecks on drilling rigs are in danger all the time.\nHell framers on a construction site are in danger all the time.\nDeal with it or get a different job.'"
