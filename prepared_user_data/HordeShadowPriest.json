Pay is decent, but the benefits are amazing. Its honestly a pretty boring job, but no one really bothers me too much. 20.5 years to go and I'm done.'",
        "In response to 'Ooooh does it have work from home?', a user said: 'My position does not. And they just told everyone that was working from home that they had to come back like two months ago.'",
        "In response to 'Man.   I do like my work from home.   Is the work load ridiculously light?  Like you could probably not even be there 7 hours a day?', a user said: 'Right now my job is to clean up this warehouse that our electricians use for products. They haven't had anyone in the warehouse for 3 years and before that they told me the guy running it before pretty much checked out for like 5 years before that. So it has been pretty neglected.\nSo if I wanted to I could work for 8 hours a day everyday, but I work for a few hours, then chill out then work again. Also I order parts for the guys and give them a hand in the field if they need it. There are only 4 total electricians on staff.\nOne day in the future though when everything is cleaned up, organized, labeled, and inventoried then I won't really have much to do besides hang out in the warehouse, order parts when low, and grab the electricians material when they need it.\nAlso I'm part of the IBEW union which is a nice perk.'",
        "In response to 'Nice.  I do IT work and wished so many sysadmins didnt have their heads up their ass in a self made man fantasy.  Love to have even just a professional org like the BAR or AMA.', a user said: 'I work for a city, and I just looked on our website and we do have at least 1 IT position open. It doesn't say in person or work from home, but you could always apply and see what happens? Let me know if you're interested and I'll PM you the link.'"
