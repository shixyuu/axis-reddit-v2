Bare minimum for what I'm paid for is what they get now. The store is melting from within & we will win the war. Workers unite.

        "In response to 'Most of you barely graduated high school and have no real life skillsâ€¦..yet you demand high wages. For what? Something that most teenagers can do right out of high school?\nGo Corporate if you want to make money. That will require bettering yourselves thoughâ€¦.and most of you are too lazy to do that. The proof? Read your posts here about your work ethic.', a user said: 'You sound like management trying to knock people down and cause them to have a low sense of self worth'",

        "In response to 'Original Post: It's not called \"quiet quitting\" That little term is a rebrand of working to rule. It's a labor action been around for a long time where employees work exactly to the terms of their contract and that's why it's getting rebranded. Working to rule is a much harder term to criticize. \nAnytime \"quiet quitting\" is brought up, shut that shit down immediately. We need to undo this particular rebrand as best we can. Doing more than what you're hired for needs to stop, and it can't while people working to rule are being vilified.', a user said: 'The fact that a new term has been made up:\nQuiet Quitting is really quite funny. This\nneologism is a term for workers doing\nprecisely what their contract says and no more.\nThat is working exactly your hours, taking\nexactly your breaks and turning your phone off/\nrefusing to answer calls/texts/emails when not\non the clock.\nIt's called Quiet Quitting becaue apparently\ndoing exactly your job is considered to be a\nform of leaving your job without actually\nquitting.\nThe actual name for this practice is Working to\nRule, and it is an ancient form of direct action\nfrom our unionised ancestors. They have\ncoined a new phrase for it because the old one\nis so hard to criticise; you're doing what you're\npaid to do? Isn't that what you promised you\nwould do?\nCalling it Quiet Quitting is victim blaming. It\npaints workers exercising their rights as lazy\nshirkers trying to bilk money from the kind\nhearted bosses, who after all have given the\nworkers a job. They're doing you a favour, and\nyou repay that by doing precisely what you\nsigned an agreement to do? How very dare\nyou!?\nIt's Working to Rule and it's a part of your right\nto protest. A right that the monied elites want\nto take away. Don't let them.\nreddit'"
