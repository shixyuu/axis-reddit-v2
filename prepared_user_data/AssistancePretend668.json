Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'As a manager in the past, I didn't always like the \"above and beyond\" types, weirdly.

I didn't like it when they just set the bar higher and higher for the others, to the point the others would start getting annoyed and performing worse.'"
