I came into work with a hard working attitude. The moment she picked at me, I lost all drive. That’s all it took was one time for me. I’ve been a star employee for months breaking my back for her and jumping through all her hoops. I’m done with being micro managed and humiliated in front of my peers. It’s smooth sailing for me here on out, folks.'"
