        "In response to 'Not anymore! I get being tired of seeing sights and museums. However, I do love me some churches (not religious, just love the set ups). I love being alone, so social connections are not a top priority for me. It's okay to want to leave early, don't beat yourself up about it.\nI used to think the same way, in which, I spent all this money, so I want to stay in this country. How I overcame this thought process was by bringing things to do, like embroidery, journaling, scrapbooking, book apps, etc. I take breaks in between wandering around seeing sights. Depending where I am, I'll just stay at the beach all day, I'll go on a solo picnic, maybe I'll go to a cafe and read. I treat it as I live there, if that makes sense.', a user said: 'I LOVE the later days in a city, when I've seen the main sights and just don't do anything useful. Just wander around, have a looong breakfast, read a book in a cafe, explore lokal supermarkets etc. Perhaps walk into a small little attraction you find on the way. By now I really enjoy these days even though they're not really productive from a sightseeing/tourist perspective.'"
