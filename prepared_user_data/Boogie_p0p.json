        "In response to 'Original Post: Quietly Quitting and Lying Flat I have wondered over the years why we are constantly told to work harder, work harder, but then things don't always get any better. But it's super-important for Singapore to be competitive against every else, right, so we got to work hard.\nBut I also see that in other parts of the world, there is a bit of a backlash against this kind of idea:\nquietly quitting\nand\nlying flat\nWhat is your opinion?', a user said: 'I always thought lying flat is the result of the lack of opportunity for upward mobility (be it in society, work, or any other aspects)\nWho in their right mind wouldn't want to excel at life and be recognized for the effort they put in? It's only when you feel like your effort have no impact then you'll tune out and lie flat/do the bare minimum.'",
