[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/uhdkr8xy39ld1.jpeg', a user said: 'Are these dirt bikers breaking the law?  Don’t get me wrong they are super annoying.  There were probably 100 bikes in front of me driving on Sunday.  However they didn’t run the lights, weren’t on the sidewalk, not intimidating drivers etc.\nAgain if I had my druthers they wouldn’t do this as it is annoying as shit.  Is it illegal though?  I only saw them for five minutes so no idea what else they were doing but I found it curious they seemed to be obeying the law.'"
