Regardless if you do great work or not, if it’s just the bare minimum and you’re not doing literally everything for the company, then you’re quiet quitting.', a user said: 'The pandemic really showed a lot of people how transactional work relationships really are. We're all family until an accountant says you need to be let go, then you're gone in a flash. It's produced a real cultural shift.\nI have a few CEO types in my family and they always complain about how unwilling staff are to do overtime when deadlines are tight, how people jump ship for a 10k raise etc. They see it as selfish, lazy and disloyal - and that they'd never have done that in their day.\nOf course, they're totally blind to the fact that they're not incentivising the behaviours they want. It just goes straight to moping about cash flow etc. It's all pretty sad'"
