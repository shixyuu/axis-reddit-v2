        "In response to 'Being asked myself to go from full time WFH to hybrid. You better bet I am going to deliberately slow down my productivity on those office days, besides the fact it will naturally happen due to all the “collaboration”.\nAlso pulling way back on my flexibility with my hours when asked, no more jumping on for the odd thing for 5 mins after hours.\nI always thought my employment accommodations and compensation were a negotiation with my employer independent of my work colleagues. Apparently no it’s unfair to others who are hybrid if I’m WFH.', a user said: 'Most of my department has been forced back 5 days/week. I said no when it was brought up in a team standup last month and haven't heard a word since. But I have my resignation ready to go the second someone tries to hassle me with their RTO bs.'"
