Asian have the “lay flat” (tang ping) movement and I guess westerners have the quiet quitting. It’s just not worth the effort. Housing is out of reach, food is getting too expensive and wages aren’t keeping up with anything.', a user said: 'It's called Working to Rule. And we've used it as a term for decades. \"Quiet Quitting\" is employers trying to shift blame to employees.'",

No one is quitting, a better term is “acting your wage.”\nPeople should be compensated for taking on additional responsibilities beyond their job description. Jobs don’t pay enough for ppl to feel any sense of loyalty to do beyond the minimum.', a user said: 'It's called Working to Rule. And we've been using it as a term for decades. Employers are just trying to reframe it as ungrateful employees.'"
