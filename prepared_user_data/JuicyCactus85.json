[External Link]: /r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/yr6tin/what_is_the_difference_between_quiet_quitting_and/', a user said: 'I feel like \"quiet quitting\" is people that have been going above and beyond, taking on more work, helping co-workers, helping with tasks from other depts (Corp type jobs) etc. and decided they were done doing it for the same pay and shitty treatment, especially healthcare workers and teachers receiving such shitty pay and working through covid being treated like shit. So they revert back to just tasks listed on their job description.\nManagers will say those people do \"the bare minimum\", but those people are just doing their job descriptions to a T. That's why usually a job listing will say \"this job description in no way states or implies that these are the only related duties, employee may be required to follow other job related instructions....\" it's a shitty way, but listed so you're aware, of saying \"youre gonna do this, and other shit we tell you.\"\nI could be considered a quiet quitter in I stopped helping with IT issues in my department because IT is paid 3x what I am making and I was literally mapping drives, troubles printers, apps etc. while doing all my other tasks and training people. Im not even in the IT dept. Enough was enough especially when the IT dudes are condescending, rude and made comments and coworkers were unthankful and demanding. IT is making 75k or more not doing shit, I'm not making anywhere near that so I stopped. Also stopped with OT. Extra money wasn't worth 50+ hours a week.'"
