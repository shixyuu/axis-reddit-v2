        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'Quite quitting is boomer speak for acting your wage'",
        "In response to 'Man someone shit in your cheerios this morning.\n“Boomer” is more than likely used to describe this type of mindset, not just by age group.', a user said: 'A mindset that was set in place by the generations before us. That's what makes it systematic....'",
        "In response to '“Boomer” has nothing to do with it so stop bringing age into it. This is a matter of people being exploited by a fucked-up system and if you don’t realize who your real enemy is, you probably deserve whatever fucking you’re getting now and will continue to get in the future. But by all means, do carry on with your “boomer” bullshit and enjoy your shackles.', a user said: 'Why you hiding behind the thin grumpy line grampa? You ever hear the loudest bark comes from the dog you hit?'"
