        "In response to 'I wish I could say the same. This year our admin requires us to turn in the whole week’s lesson plans in every Monday. We have to put it in a shared Drive folder so that if admin wanted to, they could look at it and most likely degrade me for what I have in it. Half of the time I just make up what I’m doing the last 2-3 days on the lesson plan because I really don’t know how much my SPED class will be falling behind. This requires me to plan on the weekends for a couple of hours. It’s very stressful.', a user said: 'Ours have to go into the shared drive before we're allowed to leave on Friday so they can email us \"suggestions\" over the weekend.'"
