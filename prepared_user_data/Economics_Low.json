        "In response to 'Companies have this wild idea like Elon Musk. That you should be willing to work 90 hours a week while only being paid for 40. You should be asking for extra work all the time. And you should never expect more than a one percent raise while doing that.', a user said: 'My company just added that to our annual goals. You are now expected to seek out extra work, help other groups, think of ways to improve processes or productivity and do\nsomething\nwhenever you have the littlest bit of downtime. And youâ€™re being evaluated on it!\nIt feels like they are trying to squeeze the maximum amount of work from each and every employee. Never mind that I just saved the company millions of dollars on the project I worked my behind off in OT completing. God forbid I have a free moment to catch my breath, reorganize my desk or actually leave the office for lunch!'"
