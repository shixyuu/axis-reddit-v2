        "In response to 'And it's not like they're not doing anything. They're still doing their work.\nAlways hated the term quiet quitting for that reason. Makes way more sense to apply it to someone actually not doing anything and just waiting to get fired.', a user said: 'The term is a replacement for \"unmotivated\" or \"uninspired,\" which management doesn't like because they suggest that management is to blame. Quiet quitting is an inherently anti-worker term imo'"
