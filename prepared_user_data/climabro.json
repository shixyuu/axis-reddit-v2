Working hours are also defined and there is a limit on uncompensated overtime. Many Americans don’t even  have a contract outlining their job duties or may have clauses like “plus any other job related requests”. These things don’t fly in Europe. Employees can sue the employer for breach of contract and they do all the time (Germany). It also doesn’t cost much to get a lawyer and in some cases, there is financial assistance for low incomes to cover fees.'"
