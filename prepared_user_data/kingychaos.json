        "In response to 'Original Post: How to Approach Annual Review After I Quiet Quit Almost a year ago, my boss pulled some power move BS and I made two changes as a result: I took work email off my phone and stopped working more than the expected hours. No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a \"good idea fairy\" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't.\nMy boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise.\nSo now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the \"extra\" stuff has fallen away.\nIt will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?\nFWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years. Thanks!!', a user said: 'Just as an FYI, you haven't quiet quit, so I would be careful about using the phrase at work, not sure if you have, just advice.\nWhat you are actually doing is your job, or reverting to contract. What you have stopped doing is going above and beyond aka working for free, big difference to quiet quiting which is essentially doing nothing and being paid for it, hoping no one notices for as long as possible and soon as they do you loud quit.'"
