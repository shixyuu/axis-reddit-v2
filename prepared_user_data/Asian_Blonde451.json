He was involved in a ton of projects and was well respected by probationary examiners.\nHis out of office teams status message used to be a mile long with many alternative POCs for his projects ... now its like \"off till monday, no phone/email access, contact any workgroup spe\".\nJunior examiner actions get zero feedback and are quickly signed.\nYet morale is high and smiles all around, right?', a user said: 'My SPE has been great, still schedules quick meet ups to check on juniors, and gets cases returned with good feedback. BUT now works 12 hours days, 4 days a week…\nThe only thing he’s cut back on is interviews (so far). For the first time in my career, I’ve had to say to no to attorneys. They weren’t happy btw. And doesn’t work he doesn’t work Friday-Sunday.\nUnfortunately, I can see what my SPE is doing is not maintainable long term…'"
