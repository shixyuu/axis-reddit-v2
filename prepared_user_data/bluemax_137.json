        "In response to 'Some China people have been pushed so hard by their parents, the college entrance exams are so competitive, then 996 work cultureâ€¦ to them the way many of us live is tang ping by their standard.', a user said: 'The chinese have actually written some very very interesting and thought provoking literature on this modern work/life phenomenon in their cities. There are other forms of media like films/mini series, documentaries, manga etc... that are dedicated to this subject (sadly mostly in chinese/mandarin). The subject is very well researched and debated in china but can be easily confused and or regarded as a reflection of what the japanese have been experiencing since the 80s.'",
        "In response to 'Foreshadowing to Interstellar.', a user said: 'That scene when jane foster was explaining to the kid about the 'foster theory' by tearing out the page of her book and citing interstellar really killed me'",
        "In response to 'For me it was all this consumerism and how hyper-focused the contemporary world is at looking up to luxury, which inflates the ideal 'standard of living'.\nGotta buy that landed property, travel the whole of Europe every year, go for 20-course omakase dinners, buy this television, buy that car, yada yada. How ads are everywhere now and everyone wants you to buy something.\nIt just overloads me and make me want to do nothing in that regard instead.', a user said: 'As a middle aged person, i feel fortunate to have grown up experiencing the tech revolution that fueled this\ngrowth\n. It can be hard to self regulate for the younger folks because you guys grew up over stimmed and constantly bombarded with messages from every corner of society/corp/govt/individuals... old fucks like me learned to switch off the media and march to our own beat early on and that helps to preserve some sanity.'"
