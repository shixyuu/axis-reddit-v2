        "In response to 'Original Post: SPE quiet quitting I never thought quiet quitting could be so detrimental to an organization.\nMy spe went from being a superstar spe in the workgroup to nobody home. He was involved in a ton of projects and was well respected by probationary examiners.\nHis out of office teams status message used to be a mile long with many alternative POCs for his projects ... now its like \"off till monday, no phone/email access, contact any workgroup spe\".\nJunior examiner actions get zero feedback and are quickly signed.\nYet morale is high and smiles all around, right?', a user said: 'Don't blame us.  We have to get up and the Crack of dawn to fight traffic just to get into the office so that we can get our asses back on the highway to avoid sitting in a parking lot.  We been robbed of promised bonuses.  We have been tasked with increasing quality while at the same time having our other time hijacked and effectively cutting off access to our primaries.  Keeping track of 5 points emails  and verifying compliance or sending out warnings otherwise.  That a bunch of other crap you know nothing about.  I had junior examiners across the country that I would help all times of the evening but I just don't have the time or energy to do it like I used to.'"
