        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'That’s hilarious.\nNot doing any work isn’t “quiet quitting.” That’s just being a bad employee. It’s meeting the requirements of your job well, but not doing anything above that.\nKey point: you have to do your assigned job WELL first. That means, inherently, your students would fail at their jobs.'"
