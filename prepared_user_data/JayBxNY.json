        "In response to 'Can't blame them. When they were in a workforce such things did not exist, and I bet they were a part of a union. Now companies create a negative image for unions so their employees are left without any protection', a user said: 'It's not just that companies create a negative image for unions, it's also that education doesn't really teach about unions, other than a quick mention!\nI went to a fairly prestigious private school in NY, while most of my friends went to public. They had nothing ever mentioned about unions & my \"rich\" school gave a quick mention in a lesson.\nAlso, I went to work for a union. When we'd go on strike, the way people criticized us and whatnot was crazy. Instead of being offended, we'd try to engage them & talk to then about unions, their necessity, & what they've done for ALL workers, not just union members. I can't tell you how many people from 20s to as old as 50s that were completely ignorant of things like their 40hr work week was fought & obtained by unions, overtime pay, etc. And this was about 15+yrs ago and before.\nTeach about it in schools and you'll probably see an uprise in union support. But what all know \"they\" don't want that to happen & will prevent it from happening! Just look at how many states have become \"at will\" states in this country!'"
