It's an incredibly arrogant, upper class American notion to think that everyone who works should necessarily go above and beyond what they are paid to do and come up with a derogatory term for people who don't.', a user said: 'Actually there is, but it's not this.\nQuiet quitting is where you just stop doing your job without informing anyone. In certain jobs you can get away with it a long time, it's a part overworking.'"
