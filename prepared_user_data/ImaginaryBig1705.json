What I see in new GenZ worker is that they don't seem to understand that concept, that companies abuse their junior employees because they gave them an opporutnity (without experience) in the first place.   Once you gain some credibility you can kindly tell your boss to fuck off and start chosing your employer and compensation.\nGenZ seems to think they are the only one to start out with shit salaries and that everyone before them was instant upper middle class on day1 of their career.\nThe only difference today is that the job market is a lot trickier and finding a job is really a full-time job on its own.   But if you commit to it, it produces results.', a user said: 'Hah no it used to be the first 2-3 years but now? The longer you stay at a place the more they shit on you.'"
