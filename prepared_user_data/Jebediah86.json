        "In response to 'Original Post: Hey guys, I was “quiet quitting” until I got fired , now what? So I just got fired and they recommended me to file for unemployment insurance. HR was surprisingly nice. She basically told me they don’t contest the claims, so I think if I use the right words in my unemployed application,\nI might be eligible for unemployment insurance.\nHas anyone successfully received unemployment insurance benefits in this situation before and lives in the state of Illinois? One of the questions is below:\nAccurately report your reason for separation from your job when you initially file your claim for benefits.\nEDIT: I  shouldn’t have used the term “quiet quitting” on my post because I used the term incorrectly, my apologies. I meant to say, I was really underperforming on my job, barely doing any work for the past year or so. I did the bare minimum. I was  then placed under an improvement plan for a little over 6 months or so. They saw some improvements, and I was doing okay, until I mislead my manager with 2 assignments. I stated that I had completed the assignment but in reality I used last year’s data to mark it completed, while I attempted to catch up over the weekend.\nI never fixed the assignments and my manager found out what I did. That’s when she went to HR for the next steps. I emailed HR for a written confirmation on why I was fired and she responded “unsatisfactory performance.”', a user said: 'You were fired, or layed off? Termination and lay off are very different. You performed the role, completed your duties per your employment contract? Just didn't go \"101%\"? You were layed off, termination is in relation to a violation in most cases. (For example quota violations.)'",
        "In response to 'if ur in america you can be fired fot no reason', a user said: 'That is correct, if you are terminated without reason it is considered a lay-off. Especially in an at will state, therefore one would typically qualify for UI.'",
        "In response to 'Termination means it was employer initiated. Layoffs are termination. You're probably looking for \"fired.\" Being fired and being laid off are two different types of termination. Contract expired is a termination.\nVoluntary separation is the opposite of termination, where it is employee-initiated.', a user said: 'Good clarification, thanks!'",
        "In response to 'Jfc it’s laid off not layed', a user said: 'Thanks, even though it's my native language I am always appreciative of helpful folks like yourself. Those who strive to increase my grammatical capabilities are so helpful, I do appreciate it.'"
