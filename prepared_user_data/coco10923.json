        "In response to 'Can‚Äôt stand these older individuals who are so fixated in their ways that they can‚Äôt accept change. Super frustrating', a user said: 'What age is older? I'm Gen X, not 50 yet, I haven't worked a traditional schedule in 28 ish years. My schedule was always flexible because I was raising kids and it had to be.\nIt would completely stress me out not having a steady job.  I'm lucky to be in a 2 income household, which has been the only way to live a non-traditional work week, as well as having family helping with child care. We are also not materialistic or live beyond our means.\nMy daughter does gig work, she's lucky to have extremely low rent. She was able to save enough living with us to not work for 2+ years. She no longer has any savings and lives check to check. It's not my business but it makes me sad.\nI think the 'older' people don't understand it. I started working when I was 12. Most people I went to high school with had jobs. We had to work, we had no choice. I was dropped off at the mall by my mother and was told to call her when I had a job. Then she would pick me up.\nInstead of getting frustrated, give us old people some grace and help us understand.\n--no, I have never given her a hard time about working. I worry, but it's none of my business. Not having any financial security in today's climate makes it extra hard to understand. Just my old ass $.02 ‚úåüèº'",
