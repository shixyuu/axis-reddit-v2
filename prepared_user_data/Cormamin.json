        "In response to 'This sounds actually illegal.', a user said: 'It's constructive termination and while it's not strictly ILLEGAL in most places, it's going to guarantee you get unemployment.'",
        "In response to 'Where I'm at, getting terminated guarantees I get \"unemployment\". I think you mean... social services for loss of employment.', a user said: 'Nope - I definitely mean unemployment because the employer can twist you not meeting the goals for your new role or not finding a new role to fill as instructed as willful noncompliance or negligence if they have made it a condition of employment, which I guarantee they will if they're going to try this. They will also paper your file and make you seem like the shittiest employee possible so they can frame it as a for-cause termination, which will largely make it so you can't get unemployment because the termination of employment is your fault and not the business'. It's all the games they play.\nThe good news is that this is transparent af; usually they can paper someone and get away with it because it's just a few people at most.'"
