        "In response to 'First of all, if you think you can get a high paying job without having to work, nothing's stopping you from signing up for SFPD! High pay! No work! Well, they're hiring. Go for it.\nSecond of all, there's waste and incompetence and poor performance in the private sector (and god knows the tech sector) *every day*. You think the phrase \"quiet quitting\" arose to describe SFPD? People act entitled everywhere, and people only respond to incentives everywhere, not just SFPD.\nAnd entitled/lazy/mediocre behavior in the private sector only gets largely washed out when macro conditions intervene to force the hard employment choices. Lots of people in the private sector and public sector alike \"do their job\" but many if not most fail to do it well.\nAnd most private sector employees can get away with C- performance until the economy no longer allows it. (Unless you think everyone in the tech sector getting laid off since 2022 suddenly got incompetent or magically became 'underperformers' once interest rates rose.)\nSo, there's mediocre performers in the private sector who get away with it and there are mediocre companies within the public sector. But that kind of mediocrity or poor performance in the private sector rarely leads to a crisis in public safety. (But cf. Boeing.)\nYou want SFPD to act better? Find a way to incentivize them, but complaining about SFPD on Reddit ain't gonna do it.', a user said: 'You do realize that when you share your opinion on reddit, it’s likely other people will do the same right? Saying “just talking about it on reddit” is a weird response to someone responding to you in the first place. Really weird.'"
