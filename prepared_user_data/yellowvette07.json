Management seems clueless that my coworker isn't pulling their weight, working barely 30 hrs/week while the rest of us are closer to 55 or 60.  Coworker holds a certification/license none of the rest of us have, so he thinks he's untouchable.  And an arrogant know it all on top of that.  I'm friends with the supervisor who keeps saying \"just be patient\", as if to imply they are working on it, but for fuck sake, just replace him already.'"
