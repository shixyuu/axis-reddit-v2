        "In response to 'I wanna know who has an employment contract that delineates specific duties. Most employment arrangements I've seen consist of a job description that has lots of language like \"may include...  \" and \"and other tasks as required\", an agreement to a general employee handbook, code of conduct, etc., so requirements are vague and spread throughout multiple unrelated documents.\nI've never had a job where there was something like \"configure 3 end points and one server per day\", it's always been more like \"support enterprise IT deployment process.\"\nMaybe if you worked on an assembly line with a quota \"doing exactly what I'm contracted for\" would make sense, but at least for knowledge workers, it's largely unintelligible.', a user said: 'I'm pretty sure what typically happens is what has happened to me many times before I quit working corporate jobs. You do your job and then somebody quits anywhere asked to take on their job duties even though it's unrelated to yours. If you work well this often happens several times and you wind up doing an entire department's worth of work or three people's jobs instead of just your own. If you are not IT, not security, not maintenence, not the mail room, etc. but get stuck with their work when they quit or slack off then you'll know what I mean.'"
