        "In response to 'This happened to me at my last job, it ended up being a department of 4 FTE + 1 Temp going down to just me. I quit shortly after that, they asked if they could offer me more money to stay and I told them I wouldn't even hear the offer.', a user said: 'Then your new salary should be the equivalent to 4 FTE +1 temp.  That's your value if you had stayed and thats what they should pay. I know companies don't think like this, but if enough of us bail on this shit maybe they can start.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah I knew they weren’t going to come close to my new job and I didn’t want to give them the opportunity as it was.', a user said: 'I don't fault your choice at all.  They never fix the problem.'"
