        "In response to '\"Taking 10\" and \"taking 20\" are rules used in an old edition.\nTaking 10 is effectively what passive perception is, but for any and all skills. It is intended to be used when the character is attempting a task that a) there's no intense time restraints/initiative and b) have no direct downsides to failure. It fixes the player just rolling again and again until they succeed on a roll they can conceivably just repeat.\nTaking 20 is the version for when they character conceivably has plenty of time to roll again and again until a 20 is rolled with absolutely no downsides to failure to failing or trying again. So they just take the time and are assumed to have gotten a maximum result.', a user said: 'incorrect.\nin 3 and 3.5 taking 10 is allowed even when there is a downside to failure!   thats the whole point of it.  all that is required is they are not rushed.\ntaking 10 when climbing a ladder out of combat is assume for example.  while this seems silly to even mention, keep in mind that a fighter in half plate with a tower shield can in fact fail at a climb check to climbing a ladder, by enough to fall (dc -5.   check penalty -11)  it would be a waste of everyones time to roll checks on every such situation.  taking 10 is implying that \"yes someone can fall off a ladder when rushed or threatened, but its unlikely when they are taking there time so they can take 10 on the ladder)\na rogue with a 10 in DD can disarm simple traps by taking 10...  where a 1 might mean setting it off, taking 10 means \"hey the rogue can easily handle this when not rushed or threatened\".\nthe rogue skill that allows them to take 10 while rushed or threatened is good for that reason.  the ability to take 10 on tumbling checks during combat can be a massive boon, the ability to do so on balance checks to falling is huge, etc, but any charecter can do this outside of rushed situations'",
        "In response to 'in 3 and 3.5 taking 10 is allowed even when there is a downside to failure! thats the whole point of it. all that is required is they are not rushed.\nIncorrect.\nYou can't take 10 when distracted or threatened. You can have all the time in the world and still be unable to take 10 due to other distractions. Time can be a distraction, but it's not the only distraction that will keep you from taking 10.\ntaking 10 when climbing a ladder out of combat is assume for example.\nYou can't do that. If you're in combat, you're\nclearly\nthreatened and distracted. In fact, the description for taking 10 says\nspecifically\nthat you can't do it in combat.\nrushed or threatened\nYou keep saying this. It's \"\ndistracted\nor threatened,\" not \"\nrushed\nor threatened.\" Check the SRD. The word \"rush\" doesn't even appear under the description for taking 10.\nSimilarly, Skill Mastery (the rogue ability you mentioned) says \"stress or distractions.\" Not being rushed.\nbut any charecter can do this outside of rushed situations\nNo. They can't. They can only do it when they're not distracted or threatened. Walking a balance beam over a yawning abyss into which falling would be fatal is sufficiently distracting and threatening to preclude the ability to take 10.', a user said: 'There is nothing in there about needing to not be a penalty for failure. Now I know that on this subreddit people never admit they were wrong but I'm not going to continue the conversation when the rules are pretty clear... It's specifically used to make something that could be dangerous if you rolled poorly safe as it states\nI don't care if I used the wrong word about rush. The point was there doesn't have to be no penalty for failure. I'm not going to play stupid semantic games with stupid \"well actually\" persona.  You've glanced over the entire point in order to be the verysmart person in the room\nMy favorite part of your post was when you claimed that me specifically stating that you were climbing the ladder out of combat was in combat. I'm not even sure where the basic disconnect is. How is out of combat in combat?'"
