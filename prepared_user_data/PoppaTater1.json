        "In response to 'this is what i never got why should i give 2 weeks notice when I dont get 2 weeks notice if im getting fired.', a user said: 'I got fired in 2003 (hired in 2001) due to the universal last one hired first one fired when the accountant says fire people to save money.\nWas asked to come back three months later as the IT guy couldn’t do my job.\nNo “sorry”, no back pay, nothing. Having a wife and two kids not making enough on unemployment we had to borrow money from her folks, I went back.\nWhen I do leave, it’ll be without an NDA or a non-compete because they didn’t think about it which will cause the company owner to have a conniption when they realize it and certainly without any notice. I feel bad doing that to coworkers but, I don’t owe them anything.'"
