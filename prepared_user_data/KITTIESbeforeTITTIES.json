If you can't do that, you're a quitter.\nIt's fucking mental.', a user said: 'I've finally started to push back against my employer and set hard boundaries. Will it eventually get me fired? Maybe, but everywhere is hiring and I'm looking for a new job in the meantime. Between my commute and work itself, I dedicate 11.5 hours a day to my job. I'm not staying later because my co-workers didn't get done. I'm not coming in early. I dont care that you, my supervisor, has to be here longer, that's not my problem and you get paid for the position you chose. It's none of your business what i have at home that needs done. 10 hours. I work hard to get my work done and go home at my 10.\nI can get a new job. I can't get the time back that I'm missing at home or doing the things I love.\nWORK/HOME LIFE BALANCE.'"
