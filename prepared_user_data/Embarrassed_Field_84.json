        "In response to 'There are millions of people who own a house and a newer car that are completely oblivious to what's going on out there. Many are shocked beyond belief when life happens and they find themselves looking at having to buy a house or a car.\nMany people here would scoff at paying more for a Jeep Grand Cherokee than a fully loaded Lexus SUV. But somehow they're okay with over-inflated home values.\nA mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.', a user said: 'Think of how many properties are worth a million or more now in the US. Think of all the boomers that bought them when they were 300k. They literally just paid rent for 30 years and became millionaires. Thats not right. Not to sounds like a b**** but its honestly just not fair. Even though I can afford to buy a home I refuse to at these prices out of principle. They dont deserve that money'"
