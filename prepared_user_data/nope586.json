        "In response to 'It makes the grind insufferable.  I am working my life away at a very physically demanding job,  with no hope of being able to afford a house/invest in something or even travel. Its a fight to even get a week off work a couple times a year.\nAnd then my friend tells me she just sold a 30 000 dollar clothing package to one couple (two sets of clothes!). That's literally a whole year of work for me.  The lack of a future plus the insane wealth disparity is just so discouraging.  No wonder we are all depressed and fighting anxiety,  lol.', a user said: 'There was a CBC news piece a few years ago that was infuriatingly named \"Millennials are doing better then previous generations\". When the clip came on however they mentioned that it was only true for 10% of millennials, who are substantially better off than previous generations, the other 90% are way worse off. The whole \"news\" piece was basically a long winded way of saying that the wealth gap is fucked now.'"
