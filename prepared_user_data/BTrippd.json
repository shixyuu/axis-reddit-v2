        "In response to 'This article talks about how concerned CEOs are about quiet quitting and whether they can rely on employees during recessions and such, and talks about AI companies who are going to try and detect it, but there's no mention of the much simpler solution of just paying workers fairly for the extra work and commitment they do and make to their organizations.', a user said: 'It’s always weird to me when companies make veiled threats like relying on AI instead of human employees as if they wouldn’t jump on it the moment it’s financially viable regardless. No company is sitting there thinking damn I really wish we could save tons of money and hassle with this new tech but gosh darn we just love our employees.'"
