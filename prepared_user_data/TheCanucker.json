        "In response to 'I always tell my boss during reviews that I do NOT want a promotion because it comes with more responsibility and expectations of working more. It blows their minds no matter how many times I say it.', a user said: 'I started a performance review with \"any discussions on expanding my workload can be moved straight to discussing my severance package\". Weirdly enough there were no follow up efforts to expand my territory. We're having a conversation on how my workload is negatively impacting my health, we are NOT having a discussion on what more I can do without personal benefit to help the company.'",
        "In response to 'Because employees “going above and beyond” is something they have baked into corporate culture. Seeing this recede is a problem for big companies so they are trying to reshape the narrative and add some new corp-aganda', a user said: 'I've been getting above and beyond performance reviews since 2016. I've had some modest raises with promotions, but with inflation doing it's thing I'm hardly any better off than I was when I started years ago.\nThis spring I worked so much overtime that I had some negative health consequences. It wasn't until I pointed out some errors in the commission system that I got anything more than $0 for my efforts. Even then it wasn't near enough to be motivating. Straight up told my manager (via text) that I was grateful I was getting so little as now I don't need to keep putting in the extra effort. He responded with \"Ok\".'"
