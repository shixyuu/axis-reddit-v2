        "In response to 'It’s 100% there for me too every Sunday, the later in the day the greater the anxiety. But nothing compared to waking up on a Monday morning thinking here we go again.', a user said: 'I’m not trying to be an ass, but four years ago I decided Monday was going to be my favorite day of the week.  While there was a few months of faking it until you make it, it literally IS my favorite day of the week now. I feel Monday morning holds 100% potential for what you can accomplish this week, and I fucking love that feeling now.\nHowever, also, I’m 48 and have had a quota for like 86 consecutive quotas as a account exec, and yeah, that sucks. If anyone is under 5 years in and feels like they’re burning out, you should probably jump. I’m so far in I’m probably not qualified for anything else. Not anything that pays a few hundred a year standard anyhow.'"
