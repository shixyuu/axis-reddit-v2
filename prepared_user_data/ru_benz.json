        "In response to 'This isn't quiet quitting though, this is just showing up to your low wage paying job and giving them the EXACT quality of work they should receive from exploiting humans. I'd honestly say that around half the jobs I've had, I didn't get paid enough to \"work my ass off\" so I showed up and did just what I was supposed to. There is no incentive to work \"harder\" or contribute more to a company that gives you pennies of the millions that they make. It's common sense, no sane human wants to sweat all day for next to nothing, the fact that older generations tried to cement that lifestyle onto developing ones is the reason there is such a divide in people arguing over who needs to just \"get a job\" and those who are tired of working 40 hours a week and still can't afford food or rent.', a user said: 'You pretty much described \"quiet quitting.\" That's why the term is stupid. \"Quiet quitters\" don't necessarily have intentions to quit their jobs -- they just don't feel it's necessary to go above and beyond their pay grade. I think the phrase \"act your wage\" better reflects the \"quiet quitting\" mentality.'"
