        "In response to 'I structured my workdays to do exercise and chores\nonly\nduring work hours. Off hours are for relaxing and hobbies.\nMy previous two years was a similar job that gave me a lot of downtime. I am sort of used to it.', a user said: 'Post-COVID my work decided to keep Mondays and Fridays as teleworking days and reschedule all meeting to Tuesdays-Thursdays when everyone is supposed to be in the office. Not only did it reduce my home productivity, as I used to do chores like laundry and dishes while listening in on meetings, it reduced my productivity at work as now I have days full of back to back meetings. Because everyone spread out over different worksites due to COVID, most meetings are still online anyway. So now, instead of keeping my hands busy while I listen and fold laundry or whatever, I'm just sitting at a desk staring at a screen either zoning out or answering emails - not listening to the meeting.'"
