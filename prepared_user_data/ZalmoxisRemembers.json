        "In response to 'Original Post: MacDonald: 'Quiet quitting'? No, it's just work-to-rule — and it's a response to worker exploitation [External Link]: https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/macdonald-quiet-quitting-no-its-just-work-to-rule-and-its-a-response-to-worker-exploitation', a user said: 'I am highly suspicious of these publications framing the term “quiet quitting” as something workers themselves have come up with as an act of protest against exploitation. To me it smells of false flagging by corporations trying to label their own employees with such a term to make them more exploitable. This term has already entered the mainstream sphere way too fast and unnaturally.'"
