Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'Had to deliver to a college lobby during off hours. I get there and thereâ€™s nobody there. I text multiple times. I call, straight to voicemail. I leave a message. After about 5min I just left the order behind the front desk, that nobody was manning and bounced because I had an order to pick up. They never texted back lol'"
