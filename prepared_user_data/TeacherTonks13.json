        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'Yep! I don’t take anything home to grade. My lesson plans are completed at school. The only thing I might do at home are making my slides for the week, but that’s really easy and takes five minutes (copy and paste from previous years and adjust as needed). I do run a club, but that was my own choice. I am the curriculum leader, but that was my own choice, and I’m the VP of the union, but that was also my own choice. I don’t sub, and I won’t take on any committee work. I arrive at 7:00 and leave at 3:00.'"
