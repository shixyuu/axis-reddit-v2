Back then, it was “Just be glad you HAVE a job.” It didn’t matter if you were complaining about a legitimately abusive situation—just be glad.\nThen for like 5-10 years after, I saw dozens of coworkers get the old, “We’re giving you a promotion! You get a new title and more responsibility. Unfortunately, we can’t get you more money… yet.” They would string people along for a year or two, not paying them what the role was worth. Saving a lot of money stealing from employees.\nSo yeah, “quiet quitting” sounds an awful lot like corporate boot licking propaganda.
