        "In response to 'In the uk we never had quite quitting and we already had ‘working to rule’ whereas no extras, not one second or not one extra duty was performed. This has crippled companies, especially those who rely on staff to preform regular overtime (including paid). Let’s face it, it’s not quitting if you do exactly what is written in your contract.', a user said: 'I found it hilarious when the term 'quiet quitting' became a thing. Looked it up and thought to myself \"wow, that's literally the thing most people here do, and what I have always done\".'",
        "In response to 'Any company that requires overtime is run by imbeciles who short staff their employees.', a user said: 'At my current job, all work is project-based. And sometimes the deadlines are insanely short, so people stay late to get stuff done, but of course, we then take the time off right after the project is finished.\nThat way, or getting the time paid out at the end of the month, are the only acceptable system imo.'"
