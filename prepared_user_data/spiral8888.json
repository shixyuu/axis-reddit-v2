        "In response to 'People who go above and beyond are the people who get promoted to the next position.\nThat's the myth, and to be fair it's a compelling one.\nThe reality more often is that you get to a position and then stop advancing, either from too-stiff competition at the positions you're applying for or because you're perceived as\ntoo\nvaluable in that position. At that point, it becomes more beneficial to go to a different company for better pay, or a perceived chance at upward mobility.\nAnd all of that ignores that some jobs don't\nhave\nupward mobility (small businesses) or people get promoted for reasons other hard work (kissing ass, nepotism, favoritism).\n\"The hardest workers get promotions\" sure looks good on a coffee mug, though.', a user said: 'The reality more often is that you get to a position and then stop advancing, either from too-stiff competition at the positions you're applying for or because you're perceived as too valuable in that position. At that point, it becomes more beneficial to go to a different company for better pay, or a perceived chance at upward mobility.\nI think your last sentence answered your question. The companies that don't care losing their best workers probably do what you describe, but those who want to retain talent know that they need to increase the pay as the competence of the worker improves or they will lose him/her.\n\"The hardest workers get promotions\" sure looks good on a coffee mug, though.\nIt's not just a slogan. It should be the guiding principle for a manager who wants to maximize productivity that he/she gets out the employees.'"
