You need a job done or else you wouldn't have hired me or anyone else. You pay me (or someone else) to do said job. You want this other stuff done too?

Otherwise we don't have to and aren't going to.', a user said: 'Saw this at my old job. Going above and beyond only allowed me to go nowhere else in the company because what I was doing was seen as “the bare minimum” after awhile. Another one of my coworkers did the same thing only with him, he spoke with management about getting promoted to back end network position. The senior manager told him to his face, “why would I put you anywhere else when we need you here the most to figure out the tough problems?” My coworker quit the same day that I did.'"
