        "In response to 'Original Post: People who quiet-quitted in 2021/22, where are you now? There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'Company I work at for years got purchased by some yanks and made it clear promotions and payrises wouldn't occur for quite sometime.  This was at the end of 2021\nPacked it in and for a time in 2019 up until the end of 2020 I did some work here and there that was above and beyond but only because I have a really top notch boss\nThere are now days I'll wake up, logon, check emails, put myself on teams to stop the guys asking for help when they should be going 2 levels lower, write a few things, and look at the clock at its lunch time, eat, and go the PlayStation on and play for a few hours or do some gardening or watch sport etc.  life's good and I get paid really well too so no complaints for the few hours of work I do most days.'"
