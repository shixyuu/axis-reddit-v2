        "In response to 'I flipped off the coke-head boss, blew his coke all over the break room and then did a burnout across the parking lot one time after he broke the camels back with yet another melt-down. It was one of the most glorious moments of my professional life.', a user said: 'Car dealership? Mine was a car dealership ðŸ˜‚ Coke head boss, his bosses boss was as well. I was strait laced and couldn't handle their constant bullshit and assholery toward myself and customers, so I quit. And when I quit I had an exit interview with the owner of the dealership. He genuinely wanted to know why I was leaving after being there such a short time (and this was back in 2009 with a terrible job market. \"You're quitting? In\nthis\nmarket??\" lol)\nAnyways, during the exit interview, I was candid about how I would walk into the bathroom for a whiz and find my two bosses with white powder on their noses/lips before trying to wipe it away. \"I'm.. I'm not sure, but I\nthink\nthey're doing cocaine in the bathrooms on dealership property. Gasp!\" He was strait laced as well and did not take kindly to that bs. Within the week, he'd fired my entire department, save for a couple salesmen.\nWasn't quite \"being played off by a marching band\" epic, but it felt good.'"
