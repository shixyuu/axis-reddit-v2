This allowed companies to stop replacing every worker that left and hand over the work to the remaining staff. Added to that, we've had three huge financial disasters in the last quarter century: dotcom in 2000, mortgage failure in 08, and COVID. Each of these provided another opportunity for companies to reduce the workforce (\"we're too bloated\", \"due to he crisis we can't afford all our staff\", etc).\nAs a result, the individual worker's productivity has skyrocketed. But their pay hasn't moved, and benefits have been reduced since 2000. This created a lot of angry yet\nextremely valuable\nstaff since each of them was worth 5 or more positions.\nSo after the last crisis where we workers\nagain\ngot fucked financially and also socially realized that\nno matter how large the crisis, this country is not going to do anything about it if it might hurt corporate profits\n, we kind of gave up the dream that is America a bit. 50k view, climate change is destroying the planet and we now know we're not going to do anything until it's too late. That is just one of many crisis on the horizon.\nSo a lot of us just decided to try and live the best lives we can and not care about the rat race or our companies as much as the previous generations did. Why should we when at best success means still not really being able to afford a house, family, vacations, etc? This translates into not giving 150% at work: start at 100% and subtract for every instance of not paying at market rate, not giving good benefits, not having good leadership, not having a good manager, forcing you to come into the office, etc.\nAgain from a 50k view, it shouldn't matter because our productivity is so high. Me at 20% is still more than a boomer at 100%. I'm GenX so have worked with a lot of boomers, and my current boss is a boomer. They. Produce. Very. Little. Nevertheless it's freaked corporate out so they're trying to start a culture war over it. Funny thing is the folks they're waging the war against are the very same ones they need to do the work so they're just entrenching us even further.'",

But for small city / town employers, what I'm seeing now is them not getting applicants because their pay scales are far lower than any slightly larger city.\nThe end result of this will be location based pay ranges. Which may force all us workers to have to start lying about  where we live.'",
        "In response to 'but if a McD burger gets the job done, i dont see a large corporation splurging on the steak, to stay on theme.\nim not trying to be a negative nancy, but we all know a lot of corporations would saw their collective noses off if it meant pleasing the shareholders. my stance isnt so much a quality vs quantity thing, but rather, will the allure of reducing the bottomline become too alluring for CEOs at some point.\nif its just a matter of training, but now you can hire 3,4,5 times the employees for the cost of one, i dont see differences in skills to be insurmountable from a board room pov.', a user said: 'will the allure of reducing the bottomline become too alluring for CEOs at some point.\nYes, of course it will. But there is literally nothing you can do to stop it short of forming a union that doesn't allow non union members to work at the company. But I think about half the states don't allow that now.\nSo there is no use in worrying about it.'",
        "In response to 'but doesnt this blade swing both ways?\nif you dont have to live near where you work, couldnt your employer hire outside of conventional borders? why hire you to work remote, when an employer can hire someone with your skillset from another (cheaper) country to work remote?\nof course your own personal skillset will differentiate you from others, but thats true no matter the situation.\nwhats to stop corporations from just essentially outsourcing all of their remote work?', a user said: 'whats to stop corporations from just essentially outsourcing all of their remote work?\nIf employers are going to outsource they'll do it. Doesn't matter if there is work from home or not. If outsourcing is cheaper they'll take that route. This has been consistently proven since the dawn of the industrial age.\nAs a worker, we just need to focus on getting the best benefits possible given the work available to us. No one else will advocate for us, and trying to predict what direction overall labor will go in the financial/environmental climate of our current time is too unstable to do effectively.'"
