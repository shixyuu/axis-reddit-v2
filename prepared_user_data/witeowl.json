        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'I haven't experienced it, but this would be my answer:\n\"No, you can't 'quiet quit' a gift. We've talked about this. In many other countries, there is no such thing as a free public education. Children whose parents can't afford to send them to school have no hope of breaking out of poverty. Some of the poorest children are even having to work all day long to try to feed their own families. Remember the little girl who spent all day making gravel to sell? Making that by hand?\n\"Listen. Free public education isn't something we're doing to you. It's not a job you can quit. It's a\ngift\nbecause we believe that a fully educated society benefits everyone and because we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to make the best of themselves and enrich their own lives in as many ways possible, including financially. You think you're quiet quitting, but allow me to tell it as I see it: You're just making it easier for the kids who want a bright future more than you do.\n\"It's no skin off my back if you fail. And you might think you don't care, but you will in 20 years. And mark my words: When you look back and try to pretend that it's not your fault and that your teachers didn't care, here I am telling you that we all care. And we're here to help you be as successful as possible. We're obviously not in this for the money. We're in this to help students succeed. But if you want to fail? That's your choice. We care, but we can't stop you from failing. That's a fact. And we won't feel sorry for you. But we will feel sorry for future you.\"'"
