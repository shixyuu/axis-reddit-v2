        "In response to 'I have had quite a few new hires over the years try to work off the clock and I shut that shit right down. The company doesn't do jack shit for you for free. Don't do shit for them unless you're on the clock.', a user said: 'I'm a steward and had to sternly tell an employee of 25+ years to not work off the clock ever again.  Was pretty pissed because they should know better.  Told them in no uncertain terms to never work off the clock again and if they're told to not punch in then find a steward and if there isn't one available to just go home.  If they want you to work then they need to pay your wages. FFS, why is that so difficult to understand.'"
