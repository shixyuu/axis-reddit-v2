        "In response to 'Meri moved away and suddenly we start having Kody and Robyn scenes.  The paychecks used to be joint into the family account but now each adult has their own contact/paycheck.\nRobyn and Kody are being forced to actually film in order to get paid.  Kody is still taking the majority of the work, but he needs plots and content and there's no one left in Flagstaff but Robyn.\nThe lack of K/R scenes previously was because (in my own theory) the contract was for a certain number of hours filming, as a FAMILY.  So Kody had more control over who had to film.\nNow him and Robyn have their own contact and have to perform to be paid. They can't piggyback on the other's work', a user said: 'Honestly this is what gets me through Kody and Robyn's scenes. My petty self enjoys knowing Robyn is pissed she actually has to work for her tlc paycheck now. She's not the favorite wife in a polygamous family anymore. She's just boring old Robyn trying to come up with something anything for content.'",
        "In response to 'I need to catch up on the pandemic stuff. Ty for your insight.', a user said: 'Have you seen ysabel's surgery? There's no way anyone can see the episodes around ysabel's surgery and not understand why Robyn is hated.'"
