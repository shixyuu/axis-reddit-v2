        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'It’s nothing new, not quite sure why it needs a specific term. The term itself is also bolkocks as it doesn’t involve quitting.'",
        "In response to 'I had originally heard the term to describe people who were more like putting a mouse jiggler on to stay active on teams then lying out in the garden for the afternoon or whatever. Which I think basically is quiet quitting. Doing the bare minimum not to get noticed/sacked while still getting full pay. Seems like it’s turned into a way to describe people just doing their job with no extras though.', a user said: 'It’s not quitting though is it, that’s the bit I don’t get?'"
