        "In response to 'The 60% are companies that haven't been able to fully switch their entire company over to a 4-day work week with 8 hours per day.  In order to make this work (cutting a full 8 hours from the work week) you need to find efficiencies that will allow you to have the same productivity they had before.\nI can't say exactly how those 60% of companies couldn't reach the goal of their whole staff on a 4-day work week.  But, it's like that they had many employees who were either working 5 day work weeks or working 10 hour days.  You could have also had a sizeable number of employees who were on call.', a user said: 'I've always said I could do the same job i do in 5 days also in 4 if i cut down on unnecessary meetings and chit chat breaks.   But don't expect me to work like that if i only have a 2 day weekend.'"
