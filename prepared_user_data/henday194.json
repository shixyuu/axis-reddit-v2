[External Link]: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-quiet-quitting-work-ethic-millennials-money-struggles-2023-10', a user said: 'Millennials are quiet quitting too lol. I swear I saw the exact same headline about Millennials and Gen X a few years ago.'",
        "In response to 'Idk where all this generational focus came from. I don’t remember it being a thing at all until like the 2010s. It feels like it’s just to generate outrage', a user said: 'honestly what i think happened is that the generations now leading the country weren't as disciplined as the prior generations who had to deal with some pretty tough stuff and had to learn perseverance etc. The older middle age/old generations now grew up in much more comfortable times and never had the same kind of necessity of focus/drive so they became complacent. people got lazy or greedy(due to seeing people's drive leading to success lead to prosperity growing up, but only wanting the prosperity; much like they accuse young ones of today) and that explains roughly how the capitalist society we all hear about back in the day deteriorated into the greedy cesspool of bought politicians and growing wealth inequality developed.. eventually when millennials came into the picture and were like \"uh hey... wtf are you guys doing? You're actively turning everything to shit\" they turned around and said \"well it must your fault\"; not realizing they're the ones that created the economy in it's current iteration. Then millennials were blamed for everything during any economic downturn in the '00s/ early '10s and ever since then the generational divides have been engrained into the zeitgeist as yet another way to divide people.\nbut that's just a theory.'"
