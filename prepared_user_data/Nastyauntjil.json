Your company pays for 8 hours as per the contract.\nIf you are down to a single admin your company needs to cave and hire someone on before disaster.\nIf they are asking for 120+ and you wont pay that, you should list the salary in the listing.', a user said: 'I applied to a company a few weeks ago and was up front about my base salary expectation. I went through multiple interviews and everything seemed to be going great. I received the offer and it was 30k below the salary expectation I provided.'",
        "In response to 'Hey that's what happened to me a few weeks ago! They also asked me to work on-call and Saturday-Wednesday at 30k under my salary ask!\nSuffice to say they got told \"nope\" and I have 10 more interviews over the next few weeks so my ask is clearly unreasonable.', a user said: 'Nobody wants to work anymore! /s'",
        "In response to '\"Your offer appears to have a typographical error in it.\"\nInvoice them for the hours you spent on the interviews. Including travel.', a user said: 'They asked me what I thought about the numbers. I told them that I was disappointed with the offer and the fact that they wasted everyone's time when I put my expected salary up front.'"
