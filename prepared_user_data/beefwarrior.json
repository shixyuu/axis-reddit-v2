It’s not the tooth fairy, it’s literally happening.\nBusinesses don’t generally increase wages for inflation directly but for what the job is ‘worth’ by what people will accept to do the job (which tracks with inflation).

Don’t ask someone if they believe in it, ask them if they understand it.\nAnyone who says “I don’t believe in inflation” or “I don’t believe in climate change” is really saying “I don’t (want to*) understand inflation / climate change.”\nedit, at suggested of\nu/Magnus56'"
