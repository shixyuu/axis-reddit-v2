        "In response to 'All this uproar around “quiet quitting” is a distraction. “Workers performing only their required job duties and no more.” Exactly. If you want me to do more, pay me more—I’m not “quietly quitting”, I’m doing what you paid me to do. Maybe employees need to pay people more if they want them to perform more? I know, it’s a new idea—maybe even RAdiCaL!!! But hell!\nIt’s all just noise stirred up to distract workers from continuing to fight for what they are actually worth. Nobody should be profiting astronomically off the backs of their workers yet that has been happening forever and even more so in the last 40 years.', a user said: 'I wonder what would happen if I called up one of these companies that's complaining about \"quiet quitting\" and asked them to go above and beyond on the goods/services they deliver to me? I mean, if doing the duties I was hired for as an employee is \"quiet quitting,\" then I providing, say, the internet service I contacted for has to be \"quiet breach of contract,\" right?'",
        "In response to 'Somehow refusing to answer emails/phones outside of work hours is a trend and my parents think it’s just us being lazy.\nMy parents didn't answer cell phones or emails after work hours.\nThen again, cell phone and emails didn't exist until the 90s, so work invading their private time wasn't a problem for them. Until the 90s rolled around.', a user said: 'When I was a kid, if the phone rang, we checked with dad, to see if he was \"home\" before we answered. If he said no, and it was for him, we took a message. Nine times out of 10, if dad said he was out, the caller was his boss, wanting him to come in on his day off.'"
