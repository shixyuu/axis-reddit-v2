        "In response to 'Bruh, how is doing your job a form of protest? That's like high-school students protesting by going to school everyday and doing their homework but not doing any extra credit.', a user said: 'As in “do the job, but don’t do any of the shortcuts we all know people take to make the job more efficient, including following every safety regulation to exactly the standard prescribed”.\nThe idea is that it sabotages productivity while still  being technically productive, and enables workers who can’t or may not be able to do a traditional strike (either economically, legally or ethically) to take industrial action for better treatment by employers and still get paid/do the part of their job that they like, and likewise allows unions and workers to claim they aren’t taking adverse action against the employer (which can be important for negotiations or arbitration later).'"
