        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'They’re the generation whose parents work and work, and their hard work isn’t being rewarded by their employers and society writ large. There’s simply no incentive to work hard anymore, college doesn’t guarantee good jobs anymore so why work hard in high school if you’re not going to college. Why even pass high school when most places are so starved for employees they’ll take anyone. Or they’re just delusional because they think they’ll become a star on twitch or TikTok or something and working hard on biology homework is stupid. There’s just a general depression among peoples reward connection to hard work, rightfully so, our society’s priorities are wildly misaligned. By hey, just appreciate the fact we have jobs and a shelter, and enjoy the downhill ride that is modern civilization.'"
