Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'You realize DoorDash reroutes text messages through a fake number to protect customer and Dashers right? Sometimes that really does take a long time to go through.\nYou should have called.\nIf you called and the customer still didn't answer then yeah this was the right thing to do but as it is you were in the wrong and rude to boot. 1 star.'"
