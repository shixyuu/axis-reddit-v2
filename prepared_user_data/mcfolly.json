        "In response to 'Yooo I feel that so hard. Love my new 3rd gear job! Been leaping out of bed, energized and grateful! Walking into work with a huge smile on my face 5 days a week cuz I know I'm gonna fkn crush like a superstar for 8 hours, then go home to tidy up house, spend a whole evening with my family, and sleep the entire night!\nLike dont get me wrong, this job is still very challenging, but I get to show up authentically, and the stress only lasts 1/3 of my day! It used to be \"always on, always fake, and always on edge\" and my body was shutting down every few months, to where bad stress (and worse coping mechanisms) would hospitalize me every now and then, so I could not maintain a normal life or normal relationships or normal hygiene even.\nUgh, that place was worse than a cult.\nWhat was I even saying? Oh yeah, love being a functioning person again! Haven't felt this young and alive in so long!\nGood for you too!!!!', a user said: 'Whew, too real.'"
