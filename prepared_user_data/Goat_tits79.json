[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/6357ek17i7w91.png', a user said: 'Where I am at, HR quietly got the memo out to not reprimand employees no matter what they do.  They fail a Phishing test campaign 8 times in a row, no notes from managers or HR.  Failed to turn in deliverables, push the deadline.  Backfilling those who resigned, died or other is so so hard these days, even with an increased hiring budget they can't find anyone.  There is no amount of screw up that will get you fired rn.'"
