        "In response to 'My boss just literally sent me an email a couple days ago asking me to email someone a certain question. I sent the email copying him on it and wording it the way he asked. Apparently the question wasn't good enough to get the answer he wanted, so he replied to the email clarifying the question to get the right answer. So that's five emails to get an answer that would have taken two emails had he just asked the question directly while copying me on it...smh', a user said: 'That's what I call boss training.  Make it more of a hassle for them and they're less likely to ask again.'"
