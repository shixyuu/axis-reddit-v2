It became rampant when wpt got taken down and seems to be increasing', a user said: 'I have seen in several subs people complaining about their comments being deleted when they complain about M* sk or other things, or receiving warnings/being completely banned from Reddit. I'm not talking about a specific sub deleting specific comments. I think he is aiming at a social network that he doesn't even own.\nThis affects the entire world, it's so concerning, specially given how he/they will try to get as much data as possible. And data is power.'"
