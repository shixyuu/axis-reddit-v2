        "In response to 'I'm confused, could you break it down a little more? So if I'm 40 hrs/week one month, then 30/week next month, 25/week the next, and the manager gives a vague unhelpful answer for why, what should I do?', a user said: 'I had a job that cut hours like that to avoid giving out benefits. There are some federal regulations that determine 32/week is “Full Time” and means the employee should be offered the same health benefits as actual full time employees.\nI was considered Part Time and my employer would max me out for 3 weeks then cut my hours down so my average dropped thus disqualifying me for the benefits.\nThis was at a company that going full time wast a choice but a “promotion”'"
