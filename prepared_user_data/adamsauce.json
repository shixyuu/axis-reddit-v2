        "In response to 'I’m not sure it’s fair to blame the coworker for his workload being dumped on her. She says her manager knows it’s the coworker who’s slacking, but chooses to make that OP’s responsibility. I also understand “quiet quitting” to mean only doing work that is part of your job description. If that’s what OP means, it’s especially unfair to blame the coworker for refusing to do work he isn’t being paid to do if OP chooses to do work she isn’t paid to do. OP is equally capable of declining work she shouldn’t be responsible for.', a user said: 'The issue with some employees quiet quitting, or even actually quitting suddenly, is that most of the time they have poor management that would not actually care to make things better. So we can blame management all day long, but unfortunately, this usually only negatively affects your coworkers. If you can’t get your coworkers to come to your level, you’re directly making their job harder, not management.'"
