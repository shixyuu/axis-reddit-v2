        "In response to 'I'm in HR and am inundated by executive leadership talking about \"quiet quitting,\" but this is the first time I've seen \"quiet firing.\" That is friggin' on-point, and I'll definitely be counter-pointing the \"quiet quitting\" people keep throwing around.\nContext, I work in employee engagement/satisfaction surveys. Leaders keep trying to say \"everyone\nwants\nto work in-office 5 days a week,\" to which I keep saying (in not so many words), \"none of the data I've collected supports that; you just don't like that people are happier not being in the office, and you have trust issues, leading you to think that people are only productive when you can perch on their shoulder and micromanage.\"', a user said: 'Totally agree with last comment.'"
