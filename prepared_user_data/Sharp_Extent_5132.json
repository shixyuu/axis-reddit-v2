        "In response to 'The engine air filter thing is a tricky one because you probably should be changing it every other oil change or so anyways, you can definitely tell the effect it makes on your car AC if it hasn't been changed in a while, and a lot of places will only charge you $20 or so for the part and installation. Unless they are fleecing you on it, it's the least scammy upcharge in the entire oil change process.\nIt's a whole other situation if you are at the kind of place that  tries to break into your passenger side in order to yank out the cabin air filter...', a user said: 'Do you mean your cabin air filter?
