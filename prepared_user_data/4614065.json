There was a huge(ish) movement of people quiet quitting their jobs a  few years ago (+ around the time Break my Soul by Beyonce came out).\nFor those who were inspired to quiet-quit, did you stay that way, change jobs, regain energy etc.?', a user said: 'I ended up getting promoted so I quietly un-quit. Then I was overlooked for another promotion so I quit for real.'",
        "In response to 'You guys get promoted every other year? WTF how many levels are there in your corporation?', a user said: 'My situation was rare.  Restructure at exec level meant I was initially pulled up to share the load of a bigger program that was put in place. Then, a person more senior to me left and I was hoping to be selected as their replacement.'"
