        "In response to 'They aren’t outdated but the way they exist in US elections are worthless. Someone just flops out some insane conspiracy laden claim about you and the moderator gives you like 10 seconds to respond etc.', a user said: 'The thing is that I’ve sat through most of the recent Republican debates and nobody answers the questions asked by the moderators and nobody actually has any opposing opinions. So there’s nothing to debate anyways. They won’t even condemn trump. (Then why are you running)'",
        "In response to 'I mean, is that a criticism of debates? Or would any debate with these candidates be no better?\nI think perhaps candidates should be penalized for giving a long answer without actually answering questions', a user said: 'If the debates were stricter and the moderators muted candidates who avoided the topics at hand I think it would help with the overall experience. But you’re right, there’s no point since none of the candidates actually disagree. I mean maybe occasionally but it’s mostly just rebuttals to topics other candidates bring up rather than responses to topics the moderators are putting on the table.'"
