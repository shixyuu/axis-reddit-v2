In school I would finish all of my tests about 2-10x faster than the average.\nMy scores would be 95-100 all of the time. Usually 98-100.\nThis has carried over into real life. In fact, I’ve noticed I’m now even better on average.\nIf you think that I am going to sit in a job and not be given a raise when I see that my fellow employees do half the work and get paid the same you are insane.\nEvery single job I have ever had is like this.\nYou prove yourself to be the best there, in my case, prove yourself to be better than your manager and their boss as well.\nYou get nothing for it. That is my experience.'"
