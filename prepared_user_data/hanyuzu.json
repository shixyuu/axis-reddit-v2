        "In response to 'Had a similar situation but I got real smart early on. Declined any offer for promotions because I know what it entails. Been an agent for a decade and reached the salary ceiling for agents.\nThe thing is as an agent I can work 8 to 5 with no work to take home. Maybe the occasional paid overtime. While my co-workers who took the bait are still working when I go home and frequently have to do TY OT. Fuck that shit!', a user said: 'I never do OT unless extremely unnecessary. I don’t even like thinking about work outside office hours, lol. Call me pathetic but I also never want to be in a management position bec that entails working beyond your shift and even during your free days. I sometimes see emails sent super late at night by my supervisor and some tenured teammates.'",

Subukan mo kong bigyan ng trabaho malapit sa end ng shift ko at talagang kukulamin kita pag-uwi.'"
