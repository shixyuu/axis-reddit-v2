        "In response to 'This is your gentle reminder that quiet quitting isn’t actually quitting, it’s simply “completing one's minimum work requirements without going above and beyond”.', a user said: 'Nobody should do work outside of their listed job requirements.  If a place of business wants to add additional tasks, they can pay you more for them.'",
        "In response to 'Yes. This is the textbook definition of quiet quitting.\nThe alternative is you do extra tasks and your supervisor is so afraid to lose you so they promote you and you get a raise.  I've even been given raises without promotions because I alluded to having opportunity elsewhere and they were afraid to lose me at that moment.\nThe modern worker has a choice.  Either pick time or money and the opposite will be your problem, but you are not going to get both unless you inherit it or are very fortunate.', a user said: 'It’s incredible that the text book definition of quiet quitting is doing the job you were hired to do.'",
        "In response to 'The catch phrase is new, but the concept is as old as time.  The only novel aspect is that this is being discussed in the context of exempt workers who in the past were stereotyped, in media, as Type-A yuppies; however, even among the exempt workers there were always some employees doing more or less than other employees.', a user said: 'Sure. There always were those employees.  But it doesn’t mean there were promotions and raises in store for those employees.  The best promotion and raise is still a new job at a new company.\nAnyone’s best bet should be to do the job you were hired to do, do it well and be able to explain what and why you did it well on your resume and in an interview.'",
        "In response to 'That might work at a corporate job, but I'd fire your ass instantly if I knew you had that attitude.  At a smaller company, you do what I need you to do.', a user said: 'That’s fine. You’re more than welcome to fire someone for doing the job you hired them to do.\nIf you need to hire a personal assistant to do all sorts of jobs then you can hire someone and pay them accordingly.'"
