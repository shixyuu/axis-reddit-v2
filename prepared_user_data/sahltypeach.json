        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting DD style I was just going to ignore her but then she said I could've just called. Maybe Karen could've been by her phone at any point throughout the whole interaction. But no, she's a dummy and now we're here.\nThe second I cancel after the timer is up she messages back. I order as a customer sometimes and know just how many notifications you get sent by dd. It's basically all of them lol.\nAnywho she didn't message back and I got a super good dinner tonight I didn't have to pay for. Thanks boo!\nThe alcohol goes to my favorite smoke shop since I have no friends or people I see daily other than my shopðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'i never understand people like this & what goes on in their brains. when i've orders thru door dash, request a ride w uber, have a friend picking me up / coming over, that's literally what i'm constantly checking my phone for so i can be ready for said person(s). it's incredibly rude imo, when others don't respect peoples time.\nDD drivers are only inclined to wait 5 min upon arrival anyway, & like OP said, they send so many notifications throughout. there's no excuse for this bc what are you doing that you're THAT busy you can't check your phone for 2 seconds to know when your delivery is showing up? i just don't understand it or why people are like this when they know someone is coming to them with / for something.'"
