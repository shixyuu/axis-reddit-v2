        "In response to 'This season has been interesting. Seems like Robyn is more present this season but I suspect it’s because she had no choice. After what happened with Garrison I’m sure she panicked and said we have to do something to not look bad. Hence the scenes we’ve gotten like her telling Kody go be with your other kids. Only problem is her acting and credibility is so far down the drain she has absolutely no credibility or sympathy.', a user said: 'Wasn’t this whole season filmed before Garrison passed?'"
