        "In response to 'Greg's response is as follows:\nIf you just accept employees doing the bare minimum to get by, then you’re “quiet quitting” your job as a manager. Bottom line: You can’t force anyone to do anything. Employees who coast are usually disengaged from their work, so figuring out how to get them motivated is the only way to get them to naturally sustain higher engagement. If you can’t, or they won’t, then you can set expectations for performance and outcomes. And if they don’t meet those expectations, you can quietly fire the quitters.\nSource:\nhttps://nypost.com/2022/08/21/can-i-discipline-my-employees-who-are-quietly-quitting/\nI think this is bullshit. Greg doesn't know the meaning of the word \"minimum\". If you expect more than the minimum, then the level you called \"minimum\" isn't actually the minimum. The minimal level is the lowest acceptable level.', a user said: 'I actually like that as long as it's implemented in the right way (which is won't be in the cases where the employers/bosses are complaining about \"quiet quitting\", unfortunately).\n​\nSet clear, attainable, and measurable goals and expectations whenever possible and recognize that those are the actual goals and don't complain when your employees are meeting those goals. If they're meeting those goals, then be happy and don't whine about \"quiet quitting\". If an employee is surpassing those goals, then give them generous raises. Talk to your employees about their career aspirations so that you can tailor their goals to moving them toward the career path that they want to follow. I really like SMART goals: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\n​\nRemember that meeting the goals that you've set is what you WANT from your employees. They aren't \"doing the bare minimum to get by\" when they're meeting their goals.'"
