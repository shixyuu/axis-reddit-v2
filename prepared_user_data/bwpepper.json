        "In response to 'there are women (and men) who have a baby to save their marriage.\nYou’re right; it’s delusional. But it’s happening on this planet.', a user said: 'there are women (and men) who have a baby to save their marriage\nThis is so unbelievably true and sad. My acquaintance is now pregnant with her husband who cheated on her just a few months ago. That time when she found out, she decided to live in hotels for a while — her husband love bombed her and pleaded for her to take him back — and she did. I told her sister to make sure to tell her to get an STD test.\nWhen she told me she was pregnant via WhatsApp, I was so ... befuddled, aghast .. you name it. I congratulated her anyway, even as I remembered telling her sister about the STD test and wondered whether she took it.\nAt the end of the day, it wasn't my business. But I just felt ... sad for her. Her husband was unemployed but from a rich family, she worked and paid for everything and they lived in a house belonging to her husband's family. This means that if they ever get divorced — SHE would be the one paying alimony and child support, SHE would not be entitled to half of the house (which was supposed to be one of the major assets in a marriage) — while SHE paid for all their living expenses, including the leftover credit card balance that HE used to treat his mistress 🤦🏻‍♀️. He could literally kick her out of the house and rendered her homeless and there was nothing she could do about it.\nHow a financially independent woman allowed herself to be treated this way is beyond me — not saying that a financially dependent woman or any other woman deserve to be treated this way — but this woman actually makes the money so she has options — even if it means living on her own.'"
