        "In response to 'From what I have seen as a manager there have always been people who do the bare minimum that their job requires. I don’t see a problem with that as long as the person is not expecting to eventually be promoted or get the highest raise. For example, HR set raises for up to 5% this year. An average employee doing the bare minimum will get an average raise, which would be 2.5% percent rounded to 3%.\nJust because someone has labeled those who are not passionate about their work as “quiet quitting” doesn’t make this a new trend. People are there for their paycheck only and nothing else should not be looked down on.', a user said: 'The reality I have seen is employers budgeting 2.5% for raises. The difference between a solid and mediocre performer could be less than a 1% difference, which makes the solid performer wonder why they work so hard and do so much extra to never be rewarded for it.'"
