Not everyone is a Dwight who is constantly angling for more authority and responsibility, most of us are just Stanleys who want to get through the work day with minimal effort and go home at 5.  This is how workplaces have been for a very long time.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Maybe David Wallace wants that, but we're not all David Wallaces.  Those of us who are Dwights who come in on weekends with a rule breaking key copy and constantly over achieve and suck up to management end up just like he did, only getting one measly promotion in over 9 years.  It's better to be a Stanley and sit back and try to enjoy life.'"
