        "In response to 'I have it in colon, liver and lungs(very small amounts)', a user said: 'Forgive my ignorance but surely you can have your colon removed and use a colostomy bag (like crons disease?). I understand you're having an operation to remove part of your liver but this organ can regrow? The shadows on your lungs could be treated by chemotherapy once the other 2 treatments are dealt with? Sorry I don't mean to offend and I appreciate this is an awful situation but I wish you all the best'"
