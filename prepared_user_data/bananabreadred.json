        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'This is literally me. I have a huge backlog in the pipeline, but similarly to OP I don’t see commission until the following month after the equipment ships. In the meantime I find myself making shit margin on Sheetmetal items. I literally do my job and leave right at 4pm. I used to be hungry as well but it’s hard when there are blown out lead times, and it takes literally 6-8 months to reap the reward of all your hard work and that’s IF our customer doesn’t cancel because another manufacturer has better lead times. It sucks right now, NGL.'"
