Generally, far fewer believe in the old myths of lifetime employment and the perceived honor of work prioritized over all else. It’s a combination of generational change in values and a very tight labor market. They simply don’t need to suffer shit jobs when so many other opportunities await. Companies really have to compete for talent on quality of working conditions and work/life balance these days.'"
