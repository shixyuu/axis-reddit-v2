        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'Work during contracted work hours and not a second more. You can still be passionate and an amazing teacher. Implying that we’re less than or students are worse off if we don’t volunteer or work unpaid is taking advantage of teachers.\nTeachers love students, otherwise what’s the point. But, to then expect work after school or on the weekend is beyond stupid. We work to support our families and ourselves, not to take care of everyone else and everything else.'"
