        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting my nearly decade long marriage. As the title says  I'm considering quiet quitting my marriage. I AM NOT ready to have the divorce discussion. He seems truly oblivious to the strife either that or has me questioning reality enough that I think he is.  We got a pet this weekend, I've wanted one for quite some time but resisted getting one for years because my plate was too full being a remote worker and a primary parent (my job is flexible) and I accurately felt Id be the one doing all the work. .\nI've been doing the night wake ups for the young puppy, and he stated I should get some rest when he gets up for work. I infered that he would be taking the dog outside while I rested the one remaining dog bathroom trip of the overnight. Not enough to be a 50/50... But sure I'll take it. I recognize that my point of view may be different than his and that I may truly be \"playing the victim\" as he so kindly put it.  I did infer it and assumed it was the case, but did also \"just spring it on him\". I agree I did spring it on him. At 3 AM I scheduled a text to him with the time of the next bathroom break, the location and flavor of the dog treat, as well as loose instructions to positively reinforce. I get a call asking for the location of the dog treat and he says it just looks like a cookie. My kid loves cookies but I had put them all away because well... Chocolate and dogs is no good.  Annoyed, I get up and check the packaging to confirm, yes this is the dog treat and I indicate the brand on the package shows a brand name that refers to tails and wagging. I go back upstairs and get another call 5 minutes later because surprise dog won't go to the bathroom and this is inconvenient to his routine .... In the 5 minutes since I was last present. Treat... Was left inside by the door so pup motive was not there. I take over, clearly annoyed. Dog uses the bathroom immediately. I'm pretty icy while he gets ready for work and takes a shower that is pretty long or it at least is to me because a long luxurious shower for me is 15 minutes, not 30+.\nHe comes out, I state that if he isn't able to fit in any bathroom breaks into his schedule then I would like to know because then I can set my expectations instead of assuming I will get a break. This turns into an argument about me springing it on him and how he no longer has time to do his morning schedule now because of this and the fires through the things he does in the mornings; workout, shower, dressed, breakfast, leave. Note: at least 40 minutes of this is shower. I ask when it will ever be my turn to not do the bathroom breaks. And get told I'm playing the victim and he will get up even more early so he has time.\nI just can't do it any more. I literally just wanted the opportunity to sleep 3 hours straight instead of 2 and I couldn't even have that. I try to be considerate because I've always thought that's what a person should do? I only buy groceries the entire house approves, buy foods specific to his tastes, do things like clean out the coffee maker when I'm done using it so it's not a nasty surprise at 4 am, let him sleep in on weekends unprompted despite parent of early riser, hell every now and then I'll even purchase a video game console accessory or game just because. But I'm not doing it any more. I've decided I'm no longer going to make an effort to be considerate or accommodating which will be very very difficult for me, If I'm going to do everything anyways why go out of my way even more for someone who so very clearly does not even consider me or my feelings?\nSorry for the wall of text and formatting. If I am TA please do let me know because I do agree springing the bathroom break on someone was a lousy thing to do, however I did think that a break was me not doing that bathroom trip.\nEdit: Bad formatting and grammar are bad.', a user said: 'You might not be ready for the divorce discussion - I understand that. But I will suggest that you take some steps to prepare for it anyway - such as socking away the money you would have spent on things for him.\nBecause when I got to the point of quiet quitting my marriage...when I started doing things for myself because I knew then-husband just wasn't going to bother himself to...that's when he found his intern to be far more of an ego-boost than me who \"didn't seem to need him.\" So, yes, he spent 14 years teaching me that if I needed him, I was out of luck because he wasn't going to be there for me....and then decided to divorce me when I finally accepted that and stopped even asking him to do things for me, much less expecting him to do anything.\nRight now, he likes that you take care of him while he doesn't have to return the consideration. When he's not getting the free maid/mommy that you have provided, he may go looking for someone else to take over the role. Just be prepared for that. Get your finances in order and everything else you may need to protect yourself in case of divorce, even if you don't plan to be the one to initiate it.\nI'm sorry you're going through this. It really sucks to know the person you love(d) doesn't care about you in the slightest.'",
        "In response to 'So, the thing that jumps out here is that the two of you aren't communicating. At all. You are accommodating and getting resentful, then  you snap, then he gets defensive.\nYes, dial back what you're doing, especially things he doesn't see you doing (like letting him sleep in). But\nalso\nsit him down and have a meaningful conversation - not \"when is it going to be my turn\" but a conversation about changing things so you have a\nfair division of the load\n. He is more than capable of figuring out where to stash a dog treat so he can find it when it's his turn. He can get up on weekend mornings to be with early riser kid. He can adjust how long he spends in the shower or getting up earlier to work out so that you, too, have time to yourself.', a user said: 'Just because one person refuses to hear, doesn't mean the other person isn't communicating.'",
        "In response to 'Of course. But \"when is it going to be my turn\" isn't a useful way to call him out. OP should stop martyring herself, but she should also be very clear with what she wants and what she expects.', a user said: 'I'm curious as to why you assume she hasn't. Multiple times, even?'",
        "In response to 'I have, this is honestly  my more aggressive\nWay of asking. Yesterday it was \"Hey, dinner is ready I need to get it out, Can you please take out the dog so I can turn off the burners and remove things from the oven?\". Before that it was \"Hey my days are really full , I would really like you to keep an eye out for any time the dogs nose is on the ground and to take him outside if you see it. That can be a sign that he needs to go to the bathroom\". Zero of those times resulted in a positive neutral response, one did result in the dog being brought outside, however since the training techniques I use weren't being used the puppy did not use the bathroom outside and did inside immediately instead. It is possible I'm not communicating the right way, but I have no idea what the right way would be because to me those feel effective.\" When x happens or you do this I feel y because y\" doesn't work at all because it turns into being all about me and how I feel, I do think this one is partially my fault because over the years to be more inclusive I started using \" we \" statements every time I completed a task or plans were made to help him feel more included with my family, friends, etc. Ive stopped that.', a user said: 'Yeah, this isn't you 'not communicating.' This is him not caring to listen.'"
