        "In response to 'My company just added that to our annual goals. You are now expected to seek out extra work, help other groups, think of ways to improve processes or productivity and do\nsomething\nwhenever you have the littlest bit of downtime. And you’re being evaluated on it!\nIt feels like they are trying to squeeze the maximum amount of work from each and every employee. Never mind that I just saved the company millions of dollars on the project I worked my behind off in OT completing. God forbid I have a free moment to catch my breath, reorganize my desk or actually leave the office for lunch!', a user said: 'My company is transitioning to performance based bonuses after 70 years of a set bonus that’s part of your compensation package at hiring. All of our job descriptions were re-written to include every extra task we do or have ever done, and the “performance evaluation ” for earning your (exact same) bonus now includes doing extra work, taking on extra training, extra education (at our own expense); seeking opportunities to take on more tasks and responsibilities, regularly “checking in” with your manager about your output & quantifiable ways you are trying to improve it, etc. And they’re branding this as a way of “rewarding” higher achieving employees. We are required to track all of this weekly also. It’s absolutely a measure they’re taking to weed out quiet quitting or justify layoffs, and they think we don’t know that. 🙄'"
