        "In response to 'Do you need insurance for registration? ngl I drove around for a couple of years post covid without renewing my registration, but the fear of losing my car kept me renewing my insurance religiously. I actually even expanded my coverage after covid when I read about all the idiots on the road.', a user said: 'You need insurance for registration and to get a license. I moved from out of state two years ago, and only this year registered and licensed in Texas because my Oregon ID was expiring. Very good chance if they are expired they probably don’t have insurance. That’s why we have to pay extra for under insured protection now.😁'"
