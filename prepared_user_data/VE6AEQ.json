        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Men can face discrimination for actively asserting work life balance.\nI was fired from a large Uranium mining/refining firm in Saskatchewan for taking Parental Leave when my son was born.\nInitially, I informed them 6 weeks in advance that I’d be taking the leave. The employer denied my leave. It was against company policy. I asserted that it was a federally protected right in Canada. They permitted my leave but in my second shift after my return they fired me - no reason given.\nThe company then turned a collections company on me to recoup the money the employer spent to relocate me family from another province. I politely provided them the documents the company gave me and told them to fuck off.\nDear Cameco, you’re a bunch of assholes.'"
