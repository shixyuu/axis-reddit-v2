They try to fake loyalty and call employees \"associates\" or \"family\", but nobody is fooled.  It is rather insulting, really.', a user said: 'You know what would help with company loyalty? If the US did what many EU countries do and let people know weeks in advance if they're getting let go. The fact you can go in Monday and leave without a job through no fault of your own is a real blow for moral.'",

Your response is “Y”.\nThey respond back that they really need you to do “X”.\nYou’re like, “Ok…”\nNext annual review, you were exemplary in doing “X”. Clients were super happy with you doing “X”.\nBut in your annual review the following year you didn’t get that promotion or raise because they based it on your performance on “Y”. The initial thing you wanted to do. And they keep giving you projects in the meantime throughout the year that no one else wants.\nEdit: grammatical errors.', a user said: 'My last performance review I got \"meets expectations\" I had just spent an entire month working nights, weekends, and over a holiday to meet an unrealistic deadline.'"
