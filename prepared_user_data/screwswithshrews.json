My mom borrowed my car with 3 years expired tags and got pulled over by a Trooper.  ðŸ˜‚', a user said: 'My mom borrowed my new car once and hit a light pole in an HEB parking lot. That's the only \"wreck\" I can ever remember her getting in, but yeah... my car was totaled because the concrete base bent the frame.  She refuses to drive my car now'",
        "In response to 'Youâ€™d let her drive your car again?', a user said: 'Well, the insurance payment was fair I thought and I couldn't tell that it ever affected my rate.\nShe honestly is a better driver than me.'",
        "In response to 'how do you total a car in a grocery store parking lot if you're not high/drunk/have dementia?', a user said: 'She was whipping it around and it was in her blind spot, I guess. She said she never saw it. She was only like 55 at the time and probably hasn't been drunk since a couple times in college over 30 years ago.'"
