        "In response to 'What's interesting about this sub is that you can really watch the coordinated response of the capital class in real time. First we saw articles about the \"problem\": wages are up, workers are at home. Then we saw the response happen in waves. Employers tried to force workers back but people just started quitting for other jobs. Now we see a new response. WFH is actually bad for workers. It ruins your health and mental state, etc.. Then people like Elon came out vehemently against wfh which was yet another signal to the capital class that it was safe to come out against wfh (especially as the pandemic got better). Now they are attacking the main wfh pillar ('productivity was unaffected') with this quiet quitting bs. Employees have always done the minimum whether they were in the office or not. I've seen employees not even do their jobs and just wait to be fired in a few weeks while collecting a paycheck. This isn't new but what I've seen is that there are fewer wfh tech jobs being posted.\nI hope most people on here took advantage of the last year to upgrade their position and their salaries (I certainly did). Frankly this sub is great for understanding the labour market and constantly position yourself to take the most advantage of your situation.', a user said: 'Remember, Elon makes cars. If more people work from home, less cars will be sold.'"
