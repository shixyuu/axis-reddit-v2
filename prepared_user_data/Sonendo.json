        "In response to 'It’s a bullshit term. I worked at a startup and the cto was asking me why I’m not working like the ceo there (get up at 7am and use product until 10pm every day)', a user said: 'Yup, I slaved crazy hours for a previous employer.\nThey treated salary workers like infinite labor.\nThey acted like I was being paid fairly and tried to make me feel guilty for not caring about the company as much as the owner does.\nI got paid well for a 40-hour work week, I was NOT paid well for an 80-100 hour work week.\nThe owner \"works\" long hours at the office by taking 2 hour lunches on the company dime and staying late drinking and playing pool.\nI have zero interest in being like my immediate boss who was/is a lonely old man with nothing to show for a lifetime dedicated to work except an ugly Porsche SUV and a son who views his nanny as more of a parent than him.'"
