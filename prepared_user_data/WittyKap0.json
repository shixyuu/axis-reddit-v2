        "In response to 'Where did you go after ah gong ?\nIt's hard to leave a technical role. Tbh I feel so incompetent sometimes', a user said: 'If by tech you mean DS/ML/SWE/Devops, you likely won't be able to leave for better roles if you only do work stuff, need to go above and beyond\nSame with project management, though you can maybe go to govt adjacents like GLC or GLC-like entities and slowly move out\nSpend minimum time on work. Spend maximum time prepping leetcode/portfolio/interviewing. Not point working like a dog for extra 1/2 month of low pay. What are they gonna do, fire you?'",
        "In response to 'Why not? Is it really necessary for us to keep doing more and more work just for the sake of money? Beyond a certain point of income, there's nothing wrong with just chilling.', a user said: 'Yes but that point of income is quite high and relatively unattainable for a good number of people\nMost people want a Swiss standard of living not 3 meals in a hawker centre and holidays to Malaysia for the rest of their life'",
        "In response to 'There are many other reasons why ppl would want to do more and notice i didn't mention anything specifically about money.', a user said: 'You are right, autonomy, mastery and purpose are the main things that drive people (I got that from a Ted talk) and I believe it.\nI do think compensation is an exogenous factor to these though, i.e. they are only comparable if you hold compensation constant. Most people tend to value money more than one or more of these things, up to a certain extent. That being said, many of the desirable jobs offer all of them as well as good pay.\nPublic service - mayyybe purpose for those who drink the kool-aid for ok pay'"
