        "In response to 'Original Post: /u/x_v_b explains how the sudden ubiquity of the buzz-phrase \"quiet quitting\" is really just a PR exercise to discourage workers from standing up against wage theft by employers [External Link]: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/x0feqg/whats_up_with_all_these_articles_about_quiet/im91pkm/?context=3', a user said: 'Last year, I busted my ass covering for tons of people at my company, did tons of jobs outside my responsibilities, and made sure our client was cared for more than anybody else was willing or able to do. I even provided the full details of those responsibilities and reasons for doing them, including all the measurable benefits, in my end of year eval.\nThen I got a 3% raise. They wonder why the client is now unhappy with the quality of work we're providing.'",
        "In response to 'At my job everybody gets the same raise regardless of effort or evaluation status. As long as you're not on disciplinary action when the raise is announced, you get the increase.\n\"Why don't you have the same drive as when you started?\"\n\"There is no incentive if the guy that is ten minutes late every day and doesn't get his work done  gets the same raise and bonus.\"', a user said: 'I can almost understand the reasoning behind the consistency. Almost. I still don't agree with it but I get it.\nWhat I don't get is the shock as things like your statement or when people leave. Like, that's the exact culture they set up.'"
