        "In response to 'You can actually get employee loyalty by treating them right. And by that I mean a decent wage, job security, and good benefits.\nAs an example, let me tell you a story. I once was having coffee at a coffeshop with a green logo back in 2010/2011. While I was there the security guard came out, apparently on his break, and we got to chatting. He tells me how as part of their employee benefits, all of them get a number of free drinks throughout the day. I forgot the exact number but he jokes how he can never avail of all the free drinks. He goes on to tell how the mother corporation of the coffee shop treats all the employees across all their subsidiaries. All are direct employees, including the housekeeping and security staff that are often outsourced or contractuals only in other companies. And how when there’s a round of bonuses, everyone including the housekeepers and guards, get bonuses. The SG then ends his story about how he’ll never do anything foolish to get fired from his job like what another SG he knew did, because no security agency he’s worked for, or knows of, ever gave him such a cozy treatment.\nNow I’m not sure if the “mother” corporation of that coffee shop still does that, but the SG’s story shows how a company can get an employee that won’t do anything to harm the business, and maybe even help it grow.', a user said: 'bale rustans since green logo mother company is rustans and therefor SSI. store specialists inc which is lux brands mostly handle. hmm interesting\nEDIT: kaya pala mga guard ng Sbucks mababait sa customers lol'"
