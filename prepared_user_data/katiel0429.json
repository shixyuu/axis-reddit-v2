        "In response to 'Original Post: My icing quiet quit 😂 I made some Xmas cookies and took them to moms. I made far too many and brought the rest home. They all survived except the trees. The icing came off in a sheet. Did my icing job just quiet quit? The other cookies are fine. Only the trees did this. All decorated the same day using the same batch of icing. Weird!', a user said: 'This is actually impressive, lol! It looks as if the icing touching the cookie didn’t properly dry but the fact that it came off so flawlessly has me stumped!! Figure it out so you can market as pop off icing. “Don’t like all that sweet icing? Just pop it off!”'"
