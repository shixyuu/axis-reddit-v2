        "In response to 'Meri moved away and suddenly we start having Kody and Robyn scenes.  The paychecks used to be joint into the family account but now each adult has their own contact/paycheck.\nRobyn and Kody are being forced to actually film in order to get paid.  Kody is still taking the majority of the work, but he needs plots and content and there's no one left in Flagstaff but Robyn.\nThe lack of K/R scenes previously was because (in my own theory) the contract was for a certain number of hours filming, as a FAMILY.  So Kody had more control over who had to film.\nNow him and Robyn have their own contact and have to perform to be paid. They can't piggyback on the other's work', a user said: 'I think most of the OG13 is NC with him because they don't want to film with him. They're hoping to ice him and Robyn out of the series with lack of content.'",
        "In response to 'I feel so bad for Robynâ€™s children. You can definitely see the effect living with Robyn and Kody has had on them.\nI truly hope being involved in a church community will give them a bit more freedom and ability to spread their wings.', a user said: 'I can't help but feel like them trying to push to be allowed to go to church is them trying to come out of the isolation they were forced into, even before COVID.'"
