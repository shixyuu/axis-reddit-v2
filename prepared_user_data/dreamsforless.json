        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'My company asked me at the end of last week to RTO starting this upcoming monday. I kindly told them that I would not be able to make that arrangement work due to childcare issues and a 3 hour commute. They said that I can either come to the office or go to part time. I again said that neither of those options would work for me and that since I have been successfully working from home for the 5 years I've been with them that I didn't see a reason that it needed to change. I said I have no intention of resigning and would continue my work at my normal hours until someone tells me there is no longer a place for me with the company. I have not heard back yet.'"
