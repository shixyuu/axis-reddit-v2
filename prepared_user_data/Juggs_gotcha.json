It's corporate propaganda.  There is no such goddamn thing.  Showing up, doing what you're paid to do, only what you're paid to do, and going home, that's all you owe these fucks.\nThey get to drink up millions and billions of dollars in profits to fund their long term goal of owning the planet while you worry about the fact that your rent goes up 10% per year, your groceries went up 20-30% in the last five years, and if a single goddamn thing happens to you, you will be ruined financially.  Seriously.  Fuck these people.'"
