        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone else's departments like completely falling apart due to people quitting / quiet quitting? We are a growing business, as such we went from supporting about 300 people and 100 servers to 1500 people and 200 servers, multiple office locations, and 1000 azure resources.\nOver the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.\nThe candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren't even that knowledgeable.\nInstead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nCompany implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.', a user said: '>>>They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.\nThey think this because a recession is coming (it's likely already started, but we aren't at the bottom yet). A lot of places like to hire during a recession because they think they can get talent for a steep discount (like after 2008). The problem is those people will bail as soon as things pick up, putting them right back into hiring as the economy picks up again. Then they'll be hiring at the top, or they'll scoot by until the next downturn. Also, as long as you guys are keeping them above water, they have no reason to hire.'"
