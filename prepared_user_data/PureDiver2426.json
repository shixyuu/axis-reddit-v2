        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'Doing it now.  Took on a new position. They promised me a raise once I showed proficiency. I worked hard and was told millipede times I was on track and would get the raise end of fourth quarter.  Had my review 4th quarter. Was told I did a great job, keep up the good work, we aren't giving you any of the money we promised you but please keep working to the same level and qualify you always have.  I was supposed to get a promotion to the next level.  Hr changed job titles and got rid of the next position. They told my boss you can't give him a raise without a promotion and you can't give him a promotion because we took that away.  I disputed it and was told I shouldn't have done that be cause people higher up saw who didn't need to and I shouldn't have expected a raise when I was told I would get one and I took on a new more difficult position (while my wife was pregnant so I could better support my family). I used to always go above and beyond.  I have been here for ten years and during all this, I found out that I am paid 11k less than the average pay for my position.  I should absolutely be at least at or just barely under average pay after being there ten years. That just adds insult to injury. The raise shouldn't have even gotten me halfway through the shortage.   I am now working on getting certifications for a career change while I am at work when I would normally have been doing extra for this piece of crap company. No point in stressing myself for no reason to do extra work for a company that is screwing me over.'"
