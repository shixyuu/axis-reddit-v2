        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting, how many people are actually doing this ? I keep hearing this term, just wonder if people are actually doing it.', a user said: 'Call it what you want, but I just match the crappy workers efforts and add 1%. I used to work harder, but it really doesn’t matter anymore as the crappy workers get by unscathed, so why put in any extra effort. Those that continue to go above and beyond are really wasting their efforts. I learnt that at my last job….you’ll be taken advantage of and you’re just a number, so set the bar low and keep it there. My favourite is when people go for a smoke break. I literally play that frozen in time game and become a mannequin, lol.'"
