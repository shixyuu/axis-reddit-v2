[External Link]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quiet-quitting-worker-disengagement-1.6560226', a user said: 'Let's review.\nOver the past 30 years:\nWages have remained stagnant\nDevelopments in communication technology see employees contactable and able to work anywhere at any time\nFuel, real estate, rent, food, and all other retail prices have exploded\nWe are coming out of a pandemic which saw us gain an extra 1-3 hours on average back a day by not having to travel.\nThe abusive relationship is over.  If you want peoples' labour, you pay the going rate for it.  That going rate, like everything else, is going up.  Boundaries are being re-established and need to be respected.  If you need more time out of someone, you pay them or staff accordingly.'",
        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'Given the number of employers being told to get fucked, I'd say so. I'm not just talking about entry level minimum wage jobs, but white collar too. I did the math and pre pandemic I used to spend the equivalent of a whole 30 day calendar month a year in transit. That's like getting on a train April 1,and stepping off May 1.\nFor what?'"
