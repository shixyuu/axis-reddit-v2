At least in America. I agree with you, but feel it might be a big ignorant to ignore the blatant competitiveness of late stage capitalism.'",
        "In response to 'Capitalism has gotten way out of control it used for excuses for inappropriate behavior and actions like a cruch', a user said: 'No matter what fantasy you live in, capitalism is the problem. Full stop. It can not exist in the form it claims to be. No matter what anyone says or does, it will always be taken advantage of. It is the accumulation of capital at the expense of someone or something else. Therefore, no matter how many times someone tells me \"it's the players not the game\", I can say with certainty, that person is ignorant at best.\nStop defending the very thing holding you down. The game is rigged. Always has been and always will be'",
        "In response to 'Exactly this. I have been telling people for the last 20 years or so that we have taken capitalism to its absurd extreme in this country. I cannot believe that people are so stubbornly defensive of such a malignant mechanism.', a user said: 'Well put. Might have to use that in the future'"
