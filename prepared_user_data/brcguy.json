I went a couple years without, then the troopers came in swarms last year and got me for my reg', a user said: 'Man I never felt so white and privileged as when I got stopped by a state trooper on Parkfield for speeding - he told me to slow down, and get my sticker renewed, not even a written warning.

So fucking weird.'"
