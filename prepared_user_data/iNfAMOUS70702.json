        "In response to 'Unfortunately Home Depot doesn’t care… if it’s not corporate then you are just the pawn. I work with a person who has the best regional sales for 10 years in a row and all she got was a plaque saying great customer service. Her specialist of the month item just some cheap pots and pans was stolen by someone in Chicago. Corporate people know her and come by all time but it’s just sad that she makes nearly anything from Home Depot', a user said: 'My store had a PASA who was #2 in sales every year..only kept losing to a chick who had the fucking air force base in her pocket... anyway he was very well compensated in other ways via gifts and other shit from the contractors who loved him..I'm talking about trips to Mexico..cash...etc...not saying all specialist are doing this but it's not rare either'"
