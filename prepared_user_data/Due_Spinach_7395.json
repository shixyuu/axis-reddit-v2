I’m fully remote but have to go to occasional meetings etc.\nI compressed my hours to 4 days a week.\nI start at 7, turn on computer get teams on busy 24/7 use one of my many methods to prevent teams going away.\nGo back to bed until about 10am.\nCheck emails and only reply if necessary while eating breakfast.\nScroll Reddit/social media/utube.\nLunchtime is 12-2 so go to the gym but only “take” 30mins lunch.  Take phone with teams on and go away/busy every 10-15 minutes but never actually confirm when I take my 30 minutes.\nDo chores around the house and garden 2-4.\nLast hour do some work.', a user said: 'Great job, I was doing similar after a 3% raise and won a quarterly and year awards for my dedication. The company grew 100% in 2024 and standard raise was 3%. Make it make sense. Raises should match the company's growth, at least proportionally.\nWhy do these growing companies go \"corporate\" and get greedy?! We can all eat and enjoy work and nice pay increases. But no they have to ruin it. I actually was laid off for \"corporate restructuring\" and started a newsletter exposing these truths and how you can play the the game smarter, check it out\nhere'"
