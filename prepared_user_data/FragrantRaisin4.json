        "In response to 'You've clearly never had to manage government employees. When something needs to get done, it needs to get done. You can't fire people for being useless. You basically have to catch them committing actual crimes on the clock, and even then, there's often a long drawn out battle with the union, where the person may still keep their job. Those useless people could tank the manager's promotion opportunities though, so they end up dumping more of the work on the employees that actually work.', a user said: 'You're getting downvoted a bit, but I saw this first hand at a job. (I've never been a manager)\nA guy was completely doing nothing all day. They tried to fire him, he said he had a problem with alcohol. Because of some legal reasons I don't know about, they couldn't at that point. Had to show they were working with him and go through a long process. It took over a year to finally get rid of him.'"
