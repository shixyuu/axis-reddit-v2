        "In response to 'Favs was\nshockingly\nignorant about the prison abolitionist movement. Why not have Deray on from Pod Save the People? Or Olay Olurin? Plenty of folks would be willing to articulate what the movement is about.\nHe's been disturbingly off since the election. Reactionary, defensive, vaguely conservative and angry at the left side of the party. It's crazy you have a progressive media network and you don't have a clue what some of these issues are really about.', a user said: 'He was so clueless about why people against incarceration are also against commuting the Kid-to-Prison Judge.'",
        "In response to 'It’s more about her being a shite candidate than being a woman…', a user said: 'Is the evidence of that all the previous women presidents this country has had?'",
        "In response to 'I don’t think the US is more misogynistic than Pakistan, India, Peru, Mexico, Israel, Bangladesh, etc…there’s no proof of this.\nAlso, we’ve only had two women presidential nominees…pretty small sample size to make such sweeping claims about whether women can or cannot win a presidential election. We’ve already had a woman as Speaker, which is the most important role in federal government beyond President.\nCurious: did you also think a Black man couldn’t be elected President in like 2006?', a user said: 'Wonder why we’ve only had two women nominees for president even while capable women have tried to win the nomination? So strange, what could it be?'"
