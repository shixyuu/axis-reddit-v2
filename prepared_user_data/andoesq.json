But if they do so, they must accept that they are unlikely to achieve a higher standard of living than their peers. People must understand you cannot have your cake and eat it.', a user said: 'In this case, how can someone working 60+ hours a week possibly have a higher quality of life?\nWhat \"cake\" is more precious than time?'",
        "In response to 'As 100% of my uni friends (we graduated 4-5 years ago) like to lecture me (throughout the past 7-8 years), hustle now, relax later. If you don't chiong while you're young, you're wasting your time.\nThese are the same friends who on top of studying full time (back in uni), held a part time/weekend job. Now they're working 60+ hour weeks while trying to invest on the side. And it's not like they really need money but rather \"more money is always better\".\nTheir logic is simple, trying to trade a low quality of life NOW for a higher quality of life in the FUTURE.\nSo yeah, apparently \"money\" is the cake that is more precious than time.\nSide Note: These \"friends\" all come from low-middle to high-middle income families (me included) so I don't presume to speak for anyone else.', a user said: 'Oh I get it, the entire economic system is designed to push people to try to work more and consume more, in the name of endless growth.\nBut as the saying goes, nobody on their deathbed wishes they'd worked more.'"
