        "In response to 'Original Post: How do people feel about the ‘quiet quitting’ trend? From an employers and employees POV. I’ve seen lots of articles about this recently and it’s made me curious.\nI personally don’t think you should have to go over and above your job description should you not want to, and you shouldn’t be looked down on for not doing so.\nI did some research and found some resources that support people with quiet quitting such as saying no professionally and setting boundaries (I can link if anyone is interested) but it just made me wonder about this from an employers point of view too.', a user said: 'Being a business owner and reading this thread is interesting. My business is 35 people so I know everyone.\nPeople can do just what is required. This will probably lead to the person staying exactly where they are with no progression, if that is fine for them it is fine for me. \nI will not invest my time or money in extra training and skills for that person. \nPeople who strive and go the extra mile and want to learn more skills and progress their life and career, I will back them and invest in them. \nWe have guys who have come to us as labourers and we have turned into skilled men on double the pay they started on. This is what makes me happy as a business owner, you do have the power to improve people's lives.'"
