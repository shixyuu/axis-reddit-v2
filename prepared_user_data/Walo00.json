        "In response to 'Original Post: Homer Simpson (1995) explaining quiet quitting 27 years before people thought quiet quitting was a new thing. [External Link]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYXzHjbfMDk', a user said: '😂 “quiet quitting” is just a demeaning term companies have come with to shame people that only do their job as it is in the job description. Not doing extra stuff that isn’t in their job description and not doing “mandatory” overtime. After all overtime should be a choice (with a few exceptions), not a requirement, that’s why it’s called “overtime” to begin with.'"
