        "In response to 'I learned in my early 20s when going for a promotion, actually don’t be the best at your job. Cause they’ll promote an idiot instead, they don’t want to take you out of the role you’re so good at.', a user said: 'Yes and no. I think this depends on where you would like to move up. I’ve had jobs where I excelled in job performance and I was promoted to lead. I didn’t go any higher because the glass ceiling was very low for women at that company but with my hourly rate plus regular OT of about 10 hrs a week I was making more than the salaried supervisors who also had to work a mandatory 50hr week. My current job I expressed wanting to set my career goal with the company at a senior CDM position around my 6-month point. I just had my 1 year anniversary and I was told last month I was getting promoted. So in these two instances hard work paid off and my current career goal won’t have my supervisor feeling threatened that I will compete with her for advancement.\nI have no interest in management positions. I’m more of the type who prefers to master the job and teach others to do the same. So I think this mindset might explain why I have no trouble getting promotions since I’m putting myself in a position to complement my supervisor/manager to help make the team stronger.\nEdit: my wording isn’t clear but I have one more step and a few more years until I will be considered for the senior CDM position since the requirements include both the next level up from where I was promoted to plus a few more years with the company.'"
