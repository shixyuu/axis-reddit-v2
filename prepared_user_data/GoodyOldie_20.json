        "In response to 'I don’t work as hard on my office days. I was told that we are there to collaborate and have in person interaction. So I’ll stop for tea breaks, I’ll go to the lunchroom to eat. There’s no one I know around but whatever, I’m doing my part. But I’m not staying late. I’m not rushing to get more done to make up for that break time. And if I leave on time, my laptop stays closed until the next workday. I don’t mind stretching my hours at home and if I’m interested in what I’m doing? I’ll probably forget to take a break. But not at the office.', a user said: 'Laptop spends the night in the car. Period.'",
        "In response to 'I think it’s basically like getting satisfactory or adequate on your report card instead of excellent or above average. Quiet quitting is not new most people do that as the norm. It’s only a new concept to people with a personality type of pleasing or over achieving. I used to go above and beyond but I’m also quiet and introverted so I don’t stand out. My colleagues that would join the conversation and group outings would get promoted. Not to say that some weren’t deserving but others I knew I was more competent than but it came down to who you knew for the promotions. I began to quiet quit until I found my dream job. More pay and less work and they value my quiet introverted self. Best of all I work mostly from home with the occasional office trip. I don’t even try that hard and get excellent reviews from my manager so quiet quitting isn’t necessary here but I still do bare minimum so they don’t start to give me more work. My boss likes that I don’t bug him and figure things out on my own. Apparently I do more than the last person before me that they make my half ass work look amazing.', a user said: 'In the midst of quiet quitting as we speak due to the reasons you mention. Great reviews yet paltry raise with non performers who know the right people get the $. I can confirm that the reward for hard work is more work and less $.'",
        "In response to 'It is \"working to rule.\" I am hoping for the day when people call it what it is. I wish somebody would start doing that. Because working to rule is working, which is the opposite of quitting. And working to rule means doing exactly what is required but no more. At certain jobs, you can reduce what you're doing.', a user said: 'Finally doing this and it is working well for my mental health. Nobody seems to notice so why do more? When the layoffis come, I doubt they will flag me as awesome and busy and a keeper. Just a number on a page.'"
