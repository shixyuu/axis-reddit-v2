        "In response to 'Question - you got paid less because you taught less courses over the summer, correct? So, where is the desire to punish the school coming from? You already did less work - the less work was done over the summer.', a user said: 'I think OP was saying that it is the disparity that is depressing. That without their usual summer course load added in to what appears on the W-2 form, they see how puny their actual salary really is. It is depressing to see how they earned so much less because they didn't take on summer courses.'"
