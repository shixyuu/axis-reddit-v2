        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting got me a bonus and a 15% raise I work from home and stopped trying about a year ago. I do monthly closing entries (10 hours of work), but other than that, I hardly do anything. I take my time responding to emails, decline meetings I don't have to join, etc. Since we were acquired and there's been turnover in management, my boss doesn't know what my job involves, and is also weirdly-averse to delegation (workaholic type), so I don't get assigned to anything.  Since I'm just chilling all day with my dog, I'm holding out here until they replace me or until kids come along, maybe in another year.\nWell my boss called me up today to tell me I'm doing a \"great job\". We exceeded targets, so I'm getting 2x my bonus (20k, target was 10k), and a 15% raise (100k to 115k).  Que sera, sera..', a user said: 'I'm in the same boat as you. Truth is I do around 40 hours of work during the 5 days of close, then maybe 10 hours over the next 3 weeks. Loud speakers to notify me of Teams and emails coming in, and a mouse jiggler to stay active. My job requires a lot of access to medical records so I'm 99% sure they can't use any type of tracking software. Anyhow last 3 years I've gotten good raises and exceeded expectations on annuals. Unlike you I've made a point to answer emails asap and volunteer for any project. The thing I think I'm messing up with though is turning down promotions. I was a manager in my last company, and dropped to senior in this company purely for the full remote job. I just love the ease of the job I currently have and don't want to be over 4-5 people on a team.'",
        "In response to 'I’m in a similar situation to yours. The last 2 years have been pretty smooth sailing. My job is pretty simple, and my manager and director both have praised my work. I feel like I’m not really working hard, maybe a couple hours of work stretched out to last a day.\nI’m on the fence of taking a promotion, the incremental pay is probably 15% more money, but the work load will change quite dramatically. I’m also getting kind of bored. Why haven’t you worked your way back up to a management role?', a user said: 'In short it's about 25% more money with 3x the work. I know if you can work up to director or vp levels it's a lot more money, but I'm a simple guy. No family I need to take care of and no desire to get one. I just don't need the money and it would just get dumped into my 401k/roth, which is already set at 20%.'"
