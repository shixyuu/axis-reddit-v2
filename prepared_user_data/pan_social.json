        "In response to 'If you replaced my boss with an AI I wouldn't even notice. He sits in an office all day making phone calls. But if me and my fellow operators didn't come in one day the place would go to hell and hundreds of thousands of dollars would be lost. These \"job creators\" mostly do jack shit and make tons of money off of our labor and then have the audacity to act like they are better than us.', a user said: 'Your boss probably writes all his emails with chatgpt. CEOs could be replaced by a half-hour meeting of their employees. You wouldn't even need every worker in the industry for half an hour, just a few elected delegates who'd go back to their job afterwards, having made good decisions based on the real situation. Meanwhile a worker can only be replaced by another worker. New technology can make society look different, but only the workers can change it.'"
