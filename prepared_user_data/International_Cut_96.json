No, I just left it there. The comment also had an edge to it, like me leaving “so early” was somehow sketchy. Duty day/contract hours, if it can’t get done then, it’s not getting done. Fuck the martyrs.', a user said: 'I share a classroom with our school psychologist. Every time I talk about wanting to stay after contract hours to get something done she’s like “It will be there tomorrow” “that sounds like a future you problem” “please go take care of yourself” \nSlowly learning to go home on time\nwithout\nfeeling guilty about it.'"
