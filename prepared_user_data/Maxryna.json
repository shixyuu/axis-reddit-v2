        "In response to 'As a recent grad who started a career this year, I'm so confused by \"quiet quitting\" and why anyone would be upset at it. I do my 40 hours and then my computer's off, isn't that the agreement? I work 7-3:30 M-F and you pay me...', a user said: 'As someone who is 5 years into the industry, they are a bunch of psychos. I used to keep getting attacked because - \"You only do what you are given. You don't have initiative, you should go above and beyond and voluntarily take up more projects.\"\nBasically, here is the deal - they cannot reduce the salaries. Hence, they are firing people and overworking existing people, expecting them to do additional work. Ie, reduce a team of 10 to 6 and expect the same total team work for the same individual pay. Hence, they are asking us to \"go above and beyond\" and do other people's jobs.\nOh also, meanwhile, they can fire you at anytime with zero justification, and have the security clear out your desk within 10 minutes.'",
        "In response to 'In retail, \"Quiet Firing\" happens all the time. You don't like the employee for whatever reason, you just schedule them little to no hours until they leave. I've seen it happen so many times.', a user said: 'Witnessed it myself at current Job with another coworker at one point she was getting closing shifts then opening shifts and so on.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting is the only response acceptable to Quiet Firing [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/rhhn62s8a13e1.png', a user said: 'Yeah no Gen Z or Millennial is using this term.\nIt's more corporate bullshit to shift blame for their shitty businesses that are failing.'"
