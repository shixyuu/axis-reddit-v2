        "In response to 'Original Post: Gen Z is quiet quitting because we've seen millennials suffer through economic hardship. Companies can't sell us a pipe dream. [External Link]: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-quiet-quitting-work-ethic-millennials-money-struggles-2023-10', a user said: 'If you think that is why Zoomers are quitting, you are an idiot.\nZoomers are quitting because they have been conditioned to quit anything that causes discomfort or to hit the eject button on anything that is difficult. Zoomers aren't dating because they expect a perfect 10/10 partner and the second they find a quality they don’t like, they quit. Zoomers aren’t working because they are too lazy and self-entitled to understand that a job is work, so y’all know that word? Work?. It’s not a goddamn theme park, you morons, it’s WORK! No shit it sucks, do you know how intelligent or special you have to be to have a job that isn’t work? Wake the fuck up. The same applies to college and the historic lows in retention and graduation rates, y'all just quit because it’s hard, it’s doesn’t matter what it is.\nY'all quit everything, so stop pretending as if this is an isolated occurrence when it’s the norm.'"
