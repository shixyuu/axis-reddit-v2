        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting got me a bonus and a 15% raise I work from home and stopped trying about a year ago. I do monthly closing entries (10 hours of work), but other than that, I hardly do anything. I take my time responding to emails, decline meetings I don't have to join, etc. Since we were acquired and there's been turnover in management, my boss doesn't know what my job involves, and is also weirdly-averse to delegation (workaholic type), so I don't get assigned to anything.  Since I'm just chilling all day with my dog, I'm holding out here until they replace me or until kids come along, maybe in another year.\nWell my boss called me up today to tell me I'm doing a \"great job\". We exceeded targets, so I'm getting 2x my bonus (20k, target was 10k), and a 15% raise (100k to 115k).  Que sera, sera..', a user said: 'Friend, you and I just had the exact same year. Except I changed jobs to this company, they didn’t want me to hit the open market because of my experience, yet had nothing for me to do yet. (Longer story there)\nI was with it because at my old job I did basically everything. So to do significantly less while getting paid more to do it? You son of a bitch, I’m in.\nThen at my one year after barely doing anything (but making a big impact whenever asked to finally do something) I got a raise and bonus.'"
