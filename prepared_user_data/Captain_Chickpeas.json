        "In response to 'It’s boomers gaslighting. Now they are out of workforce. They have nothing left in terms of an identity. They spent so many years working hard, missing events, family, hobbies, and friends. For what? nothing.\nEdit: I’d like to note that I did make blanket statement about boomers I’m well aware that’s it’s not all of them. It’s just from what I have noticed and personally experienced it’s about 8/10 of them. To the 2/10 that are not assholes, Thanks for being cool and having empathy.', a user said: 'It’s boomers gaslighting.\nThank you for mentioning this. I too have a feeling the current corporate culture is heavily fueled by boomer mentality of \"you have to work hard, because that's how it's always been and I didn't die from it either\"'"
