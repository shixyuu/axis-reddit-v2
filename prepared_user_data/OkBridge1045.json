        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'My thoughts on it is that it should be normal, and going above and beyond should be called \"loudly working\".\nNo company (unless it's your own, of course), is worth going above and beyond for. They don't care about you. You can have the nicest manager or the nicest boss, but when push comes to shove, they won't hesitate to fire you or cut your pay. Being employed these days us a tussle between companies trying to get the most work for the least pay, and the employee trying to do the bare minimum. The meeting point is delivering what is required in the given time frame, working within your working hours and not giving your workplace your entire life, and I'm not going to mess up that equilibrium. The employers can shame people all they want, but a job is like a transaction and i won't give you more than what we agreed for.'"
