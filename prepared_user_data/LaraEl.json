        "In response to 'A while ago I read a story about a german guy who was a manager in japan. He had a hard time to get his people to leave on time. So when he wanted to work late himself but not keep his people at their desks, he just went for a short walk around the block at the normal time. When he got back, the office was empty.', a user said: 'I know their situation is terrible, but the idea of this manager literally tricking his employees into leaving so he can get some quiet working hours in the office makes me giggle. What a good manager.'"
