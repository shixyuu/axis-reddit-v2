        "In response to 'From what I gather, \"Quiet Quitting\" means not donating extra time to the company for free, just to maintain some sort of \"warm and fuzzy feelings\" from management. God forbit folks do what they were hired (and agreed) to.\nThere is a school of thought that says workers who dedicate all their time/life to a company are rewarded, and while this may have been true decades ago or in a few minority companies, the vast majority of companies will happily burn down employees, toss them aside when no longer useful, and hire new younger models. This simply isn't true any longer and employees are treated like shot or replaced on the whims of the executive suite.', a user said: 'My husband used to get decent bonuses and even a couple of significant merit raises, and he was always happy to put in extra time in the evenings and weekends occasionally. Now he gets 3% raises and his last bonus was $428 (no, I didn’t miss a number). He shuts his computer off exactly at 5:00, and that’s that.\nIf you want employees to go above and beyond, you need to make sure you are showing your appreciation in meaningful ways.'",
        "In response to 'I am the same. I am happy to give extra time when I am compensated (or even acknowledged) for it but when not, it's exactly 5pm logoff. I think it's sad that there is a number of people who think giving what is agreed upon is \"silent quitting\", when in reality it is just simply the tradeoff between employer and employee.', a user said: 'Yes, you agreed to do a job and work a certain number of hours per week. It is not quitting to fulfill that agreement at the bare minimum.'",
        "In response to 'Yeah but what about those pizza parties. Isn’t that a great show of appreciation?', a user said: 'Once they even had mimosas!'",
        "In response to 'This is at-odds with the state of employment in tech. Most fresh grads I know have had a terrible time trying to find work, with unemployment periods beyond 6 months not unusual.\nAm I biased in my sampling or is there a way to reconciled these findings with their experience?', a user said: 'My husband is in tech, and while he’s older, he has been low key looking for about a year. In contrast, he was recruited for his current job, and it only took about three months for him to find the job before that. It is kind of a niche position though, so that may be part of it.'",
        "In response to 'The amount of cars I see on the roads at random hours during the week like 9 am-1pm is insane. So much traffic  you’re telling me all these people are third shift workers, restaurant workers ? I don’t buy it lol. It just blows my mind how there’s bumper to bumper traffic on a Tuesday at 10:30 am. Maybe these are all work from home people going to the park to do their work lol', a user said: 'I think it has always been that way. I was a SAHM for many years, and traffic sucked during the day then too. I used to run my errands after 7pm when I could.'"
