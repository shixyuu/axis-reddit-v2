        "In response to 'I’ve just realised that I’ve been quietly quitting for the last 18 months. Now I’ve really quit!  Cant put up with the BS any more. I was a teacher and now I’m not. Parent BS colleague BS children BS. Outside Agencies BS Senior leaders BS. Especially 10pm texts and being expected to be available 24/7 with pretty average pay. Viva quiet quitting!!!', a user said: 'This sucks because I have teachers from when I was in middle/high school 7+ years ago who are quitting because they’re not getting paid enough to deal with all of the bullshit. And these are truly amazing people that I loved and were very good at their jobs. By not paying teachers an adequate wage, the children are losing out on really talented educators.'",
        "In response to 'Other countries just call that \"doing their job\"', a user said: 'Same, I do my job all day and even do a little more than I am supposed to when needed. But I work in real estate and had to take a pay cut recently to stay employed because of the market, which is still preferable to having no job. But my phone and work laptop is shut off exactly at quitting time and I will not be doing more than exactly what I get paid to do. Which I haven’t gotten any complaints so 🤷🏻‍♀️'"
