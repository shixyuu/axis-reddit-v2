        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home.\nThat's all there is to it. I got an email today at 2:15 this afternoon. It wasn't anything stressful, it would probably take me less than a minute to respond, and nope. It's the weekend. My hours are 8:10 - 3:40 M-F. If you call me at 3:41 on a Friday with some SUPER OMEGA IMPORTANT ISSUE....sorry. I'm not available. I'll respond at 8:10 Monday morning.\nI've literally slammed my computer down and walked our mid-sentence at 3:40 while my director was trying to keep us, '5 more minutes' for some meeting. Screw you. I've never asked you to stay 5 more minutes for anything.\nFinally, it's not 'quiet quitting', that's not a thing. You are working your contract.'"
