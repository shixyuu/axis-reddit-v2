That’s not at all the case lol. Massive layoffs mean a huge amount of salaries no longer being paid. Thats an incredible amount of money saved in the short term for these places cutting thousands of jobs. Of course the market cap will rise. Getting angry at this is old man yelling at cloud tier not comprehending economics, and even if we tax billionaires more and create systems that better protect workers, economics will still need to exist for that to all work, so you should really learn a little bit about it.'",
        "In response to 'Short term profits barely affect a companies market cap of a company, especially a growth company like META or other tech companies being mentioned in this thread.\nCompanies are theorhetically valued at the present value of all future cash flows. That means the next few years barely impact the price since they're being lumped in with all future assumed cash flow (many years).\nThis is why interest rates impact the price of these stocks much more significantly since they're much more relevant when determining the discount rate which you use to adjust for the present value of those future cash flows.', a user said: 'All future cash flows… much less of that paying these salaries… nobody priced in mass layoffs in 23 lmao and this is a liquid market. You’re agreeing with me without realizing it.'"
