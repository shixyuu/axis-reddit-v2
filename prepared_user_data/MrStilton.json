        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'I can see why HR types and corporate PR departments want to popularise this term as it obviously serves their interests to promote the notion that doing more work that you agree to in your contract of employment is the norm.\nPersonally, I hate it.\nWhen I enter into employment I come to an agreement to perform certain tasks in exchange for an agreed upon remuneration package.\nIf an employer wants me to do more tasks than I've agreed to they are welcome to offer me higher remuneration and I'll consider it.\nBut I'm not doing more work for free.'"
