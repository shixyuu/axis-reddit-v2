He was involved in a ton of projects and was well respected by probationary examiners.\nHis out of office teams status message used to be a mile long with many alternative POCs for his projects ... now its like \"off till monday, no phone/email access, contact any workgroup spe\".\nJunior examiner actions get zero feedback and are quickly signed.\nYet morale is high and smiles all around, right?', a user said: 'Yep my spe has been out of the office like half the time\nClearly using up the leave before the make an exit\nBasically minimally responsive\nBut I don't blame em at all, I would totally do the same'",
