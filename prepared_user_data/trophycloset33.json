        "In response to 'Original Post: How to Approach Annual Review After I Quiet Quit Almost a year ago, my boss pulled some power move BS and I made two changes as a result: I took work email off my phone and stopped working more than the expected hours. No more extra from me - if an opportunity for a conference proposal comes and she doesn't mention it at the weekly meeting, neither do I. If she has a \"good idea fairy\" moment of something she's really like to see happen I just...don't.\nMy boss's boss knows my boss is a piece of work and after I confided in a colleague that I was thinking about leaving, I was rewarded with a raise.\nSo now we're at the year-end and I put together the end-of-quarter metrics. To do so, I pulled from last year's annual report, and holy hell while we've hit our metrics most of the \"extra\" stuff has fallen away.\nIt will be time soon for my annual review and next year's goal-setting. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for the discussion. I'm thinking that no good comes of telling her that I'm done doing more than what's required, but I have to think it will be fairly obvious. Anyone have any good advice?\nFWIW we are a team of three, and we replaced the other team member last year, had someone for a little over a month who didn't work out, so I think I can play it off like some of my time was spent mentoring? I also want to stay in this job at least 5 more years because of some specific benefits and the hopes that my retirement-aged boss will quit in the next two years. Thanks!!', a user said: 'Sounds like it’s time for you to move on. This is holding you back.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: What to do if my counterpart has \"quiet quit\"? One of my coworkers has been quiet quitting for a long time. But we're basically in a workplace where people are unfireable (government job). His boss does not seem to want to confront him about slacking, so instead, she gives his work to me and makes everything about \"we\" and \"us\" instead of \"him\".\nInstead of telling him directly, for example, \"hey PERSON X, why aren't you responding to my e-mails?\" She'll e-mail both of us and say \"Hey Team, why aren't you guys responding to my e-mails?\" (When it's very obviously him, not me.)\nWhen he decides not to do his work, she just gives his work to me.\nHonestly, I don't care if he quiet quits -- that's his business. But when his refusal to do work is falling on my table, that's where I start to see things getting problematic. How would you deal with this situation? Telling on him is not a good option, we are equals in the workplace and he considers me a friend.\nEDIT: Wow, so many responses! Yes perhaps my use of \"quiet quitting\" wasn't the right choice of words. My coworker came into my office on Friday and told me he doesn't \"give a f***\" about this job but he feels powerful because he feels \"unfireable\". He spends the entire day working on his own stuff (he has a few side jobs that he does). Our boss seems to be intimidated by him and takes the easy way out - instead of giving work to someone who's going to push back, she'll dump it on others instead. Firing someone is an extremely complicated and long process here, and probably not something she wants to go through. The boss is in her third trimester of pregnancy and getting ready to go on maternity leave. My coworker and I have similar job descriptions so it's easy to give his work to me. Addressing the \"friend\" issue: yeah, I don't really know if \"friend\" was the right word here either. But we're equals and I guess you could say \"friendly\" to each other. Coworker brings me baked goods sometimes, has invited me to get-togethers, things like that. Situation really sucks.', a user said: 'Make sure you hold yourself accountable to your job description and hours. You can only get so much done and if your boss is overloading you with work, give a realistic evaluation and return time to her. If she doesn’t like it, she can offload your plate.\nAlso go hunt for a new job. At the minimum use the new responsibilities to boost your resume. Come back and use the new job as a bargaining chip for higher pay to go with the increased responsibility.'",
        "In response to 'Do you mean 12 hours is what people normally do as “real work”?', a user said: 'For many white collar jobs, you aren’t paid for discrete labor but for the knowledge you bring to the table. Look at accountants. There are so many softwares at all types of maturation stages that can handle accounting. A vast majority of data entry is automated or handled by under paid clerks. Most accountants aren’t expended to balance books but instead review errors, look for discrepancies and do root cause analysis; effectively they are paid to find out why the balance sheets aren’t perfect. You need accountants to talk to sales and operations and etc when something goes wrong. This doesn’t take 40 hours of continuous labor. Most of your time will be spent waiting for your next meeting to describe the problem and review the data and come to an action item.'"
