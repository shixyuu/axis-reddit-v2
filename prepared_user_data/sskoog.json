        "In response to 'Original Post: Saw this posted on LinkedIn: “Quiet Quitting” [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/g2rczsex4xh91.jpg', a user said: 'Equating a low-but-still-(barely)-adequate performance level with “quitting” is, itself, a loaded codephrase marking a baaad precedent.\nGartner warned, back in the mid-2000s, that “chat would become the new email,” and time elapsed till answering [chat/email] would eventually see use as a performance/effectiveness metric.\nThis is more of that.  “You didn’t respond at 19:55 on a Thursday” — “Hey, I wrote an email at 5:59, so if you were really a committed employee, you would’ve picked up the ball and run with it” — “Well, So-and-So isn’t a REAL employee, (s)he only wears the minimum six pieces of flair.”\nIf late-night and weekend crises (assuming they ARE crises) are the expected norms, then state that in the job req, and perhaps factor it into the compensation schedule.  Otherwise trying to “bluff” or “psyche” workaholism into a 9-to-5 job description is dirty pool.'"
