        "In response to 'And given the polling done on young people - it is clear that the majority of Gen Z are against the current economic system. The raindrops are accumulating fast.\nWe have our first Gen Z congressman, Maxwell Frost. The green shoots are there that were absent in 2013 in the wake of Occupy Wall Street.\nMillenials gave our current movement a test run in 2011 - the fight for $15 came soon after. Then Bernie's two runs brought the concerns of OWS to a mass consciousness with Bernie's empathetic & concise framing.\nGen Z has seen how unfair the economy has been to their parents & siblings. Our movement is gaining strength, the reason it seems hopeless at times is because of how batshit the wealthy have become in response to our movement.\nThey have decided its better to destroy the planet, our ecosystems, any hope that young people have. If the alternative is to pay higher taxes & not have biggest house, biggest money, bestest sports car, etc. But they've gone too far and overshot - and they've set the stage for a much farther left future.', a user said: 'Gen Z doesnt vote or participate in local and state and federal elections.'"
