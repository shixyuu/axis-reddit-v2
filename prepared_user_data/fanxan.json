        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone “quiet quitting” this year? I’m curious if anyone else is doing this and how it’s going. My mental health was a mess after last year and my home life is messy— my daughter has a chronic illness that is not in remission. I decided at the end of last year that I was done overextending myself for this job.\nSince then, I’ve just said no, over and over. Can I help take tickets at a football game for four hours and $30? No. Can I lead a PLC? No. Can I mentor a new teacher for an extra plan bell? No, because I’ll just get called to sub for free every day— learned the hard way last year. I’m contracted to work from 7:45-3:15 and so that’s when I arrive and when I go home. If I have to stay extra for any reason— like my daughter’s late practice— I watch Netflix on my school computer and get a Pepsi.\nIt’s been a real relief so far— knowing there’s no pressure for what else may be lurking ahead. It doesn’t matter, because I’m not doing it anyway.', a user said: 'My first year as a licensed teacher but I've been in the classroom in some function for 7 years. At 2.20 I hit the bricks unless it's my late day, where I stay for 10 minutes to see if any students are staying after before I hit the bricks. I'm not trading preps for coverage, I'm not offering to take on any extra work, not running a club, not coaching, not doing night school, no nothing. I go home at 2.20, do about 90 minutes of prep at home where I don't have to fight the copier or the wifi, take a nap and when my husband gets home around 6 we have dinner. I do my best for 7 hours and that's it. Tank is empty, tomorrow is another day.'"
