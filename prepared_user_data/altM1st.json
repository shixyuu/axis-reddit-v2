        "In response to 'Work ethic?\nI spent 5 years living in Japan, and from what I saw in the white collar industry a lot of that ‘worth ethic’ is face time.\nWhy were all the workers taking random naps at their desk during the day instead of just getting a good nights sleep? Because it wasn’t socially acceptable to leave the office until their boss had left, and he didn’t leave until 9.  Then they all had an hour commute home. These were not super productive people. They were worn out for no good reason. There is no work life balance.\nYou’d occasionally have someone who dared have a hobby or a work life balance, you could easily point them out because they were well rested and happy. They were also social and workplace outcasts.\nA lot of Japans social issues would be eased by a better work / life balance. For that to happen it would mean a massive top down social change.', a user said: 'top down\nThe other way.\nUnless you mean top falling down.'",
        "In response to 'no, it in Japan this can only happen from the top down. if the boss goes home at 5pm, then the workers can do home at 5pm. seniority matters way too much and that will not change until the last Japanese person dies alone on a now deserted Island.', a user said: 'Or the winners in next revolution will wave dakimakura instead of a flag.'"
