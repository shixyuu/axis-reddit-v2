        "In response to 'Iâ€™ve been here before too. First month of the gig was pretty sweet, getting paid to watch shows and play video games with a bit of paperwork and phone calls in between. After that I was bored out of my mind! I would just walk in, sit for 8 hours, then leave. Accumulated weight like crazy too.', a user said: 'Had something similar in retail management for a highly seasonal store. As long as there wasn't anything to stock, organize, sweep or anything else my only requirement was opening/closing the store and being there in case anybody came in during the off season. I'd see maybe 1 or 2 people a week for 48 weeks a year.\nStarted sculpting at work, ended up grabbing a ps4 after a year because I got bored with sculpting. After another year I got bored with the ps4 unless something new had just come out and started walking around the shop while messing around on my phone. There were days I'd walk a marathon over the 10 hour shift.\nWent to the zoo and saw a stressed out jaguar pacing around it's cage that reminded me of me at work. Next day I counted how many laps it took to walk a mile, 28. I was taking 700+ laps around the store.\nI left shortly after.'"
