        "In response to 'Many older generations in the US still operate that working hard and going above what you are asked to do makes you look good. Bosses will give you more attention and thus a raise or better reviews. This culture is now used to control people.', a user said: 'I talked to my therapist about this a few years ago when I was putting in a lot of extra hours and miserable all the time. They said that I was burning myself out because I had internalized the protestant (puritan) work ethic and had convinced myself that suffering would build character/lead to reward (in this world, or the next, though I don't believe in an afterlife), at the expense of my own happiness and fulfillment. I've come to believe that too many people have the same problem, and am glad younger people are waking up to it and rejecting the concept, even if they don't know about the terminology.'"
