        "In response to 'Hold up though, wouldn’t they un-ironically solve a lot of problems from teaching?

It would incentivize maybe a more burned out teacher, and it would give teachers who have been trying really hard but are getting burnt out fair comp for the work they put in. Even if it was an extra $200 tax free it would be a step in right direction, no?', a user said: 'Iirc my professors had something like this in college, but they said the prep time they got paid for for each class was only a few hours, when in actuality they needed a lot more'"
