Why Gen Z, millennials are using 'quiet quitting' to cope [External Link]: https://moneywise.com/real-estate/real-estate/young-man-quiet-quitting-cope', a user said: 'I don't think anyone is denying or confused by the affordability issue.\nIt's not even really that complex. IMO, housing was perhaps somewhat inflated prior to covid, and I was saying in 2018/2019 that I wondered if there might be a small correction coming, or at least prices would stay leveled off. And in some areas back then, prices did sort of stagnate from like 2017-2020. At least in my area(the front range), that was more or less the case.\nBut then the insanity happened and prices jumped 40-50%.\nHomes were more or less affordable prior to 2020, with low interest rates and prices that weren't totally bonkers. Now both prices and interest rates are up. It's not confusing.\nWe'll see what happens over the course of the next few years. I suspect housing will probably continue a slow decline overall, but that also assumes the economy doesn't totally fucking implode, and it very well might.'"
