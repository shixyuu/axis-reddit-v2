        "In response to 'Ya. I love to cook. If that was the only chore, I would still be here for it. But then there is the clean up. So draining after a day of work. Plus all the extra groceries when your going to make a real meal. Like 10 plus ingredients. Now it’s like. Some chicken nuggets tonight for them, cucumber slices and ranch, a fruit. It’s not awesome but they don’t whine the whole meal either.', a user said: 'Veggies and fruit are always a perfect addition to literally anything. And chicken nuggets are awesome. We do the same. My kid (3) has just started liking hot sauce with them so that’s an adventure.\nETA forgot to say, I also love cooking and despise/am terrible at the clean up so I save real cooking for when I have the time to treat myself to a somewhat destructive activity.'"
