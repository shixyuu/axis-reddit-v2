        "In response to 'I've been watching a Japanese YouTuber that talks about the life of working in a manufacturing engineering role, and he gives countless examples of how getting an \"exceed expectations\" or being promoted is actually considered a penalty game. You work your ass off and you only get like a 3-5% wage increase and once you are promoted, you are given more work to do without getting much increase in pay.\nSome view the young people who are \"quiet quitting\" to be the smarter ones, where they reached the same enlightenment that many reached in their mid-years of working less is better.', a user said: 'Dunno about Japan but it's 100% true in the US. Working your ass off and giving things up for the company does nothing but show them that you're a sucker who will keep doing it for no reward. There are no downsides to operating with self-respect and working to your role and compensation.'"
