You will tell your boss to F off? lol\nGuys on the streets get direct order from higher ups to not get involved with bikers. What ya want them to do? Get in trouble for insubordination?', a user said: 'They don’t get orders though. It’s just easier to day “the case won’t go anywhere” (even though it’s not their call) than it is to actually work.\nIf they actually wanted something down, they’d be catching these guys, because it’s going to look bad on the DAs record if the cops keep catching these guys and the DA lets them go.'"
