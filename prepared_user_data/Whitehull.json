For some of them, 30 days didn't even pass before recruiter contracts went out to replace them as we had lost key skillsets we decided we once again required.', a user said: 'Lol, that happened with the bookkeeping company I worked at. Wasn't even April 2020 and they suddenly axed 60 new hires out of a work force of a 300. Month later they're recruiting and I had people reach out to me about rejoining. I don't even know why I was fired, since I had some of the best metrics on my team. Told them to fuck off and it felt fantastic.'"
