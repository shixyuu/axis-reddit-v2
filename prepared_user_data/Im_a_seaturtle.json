        "In response to 'That’s the whole point of America.\nAmerica in reality is just a breeding ground for people to be groomed to be the perfect workers to be exploited by businesses.\nThis message of worshipping “hard work” and making more $ is rammed down our throat in every facet of life the day we are born. Americans are brainwashed into this cult like mindset that all that matters in life is work.\nCorporations spend billions of dollars pumping this message into the culture, and our education system has also slowly been getting taken over by corporate control as well.\nThis is why the mentality of excessive spending is pushed, this is why Americans are loaded to debt up to their eyeballs. It makes them easily exploitable workers.\nIn America businesses have more rights and freedoms than human beings.', a user said: 'I’d like to add, there is currently hope. There are major cracks forming in the work culture of America, hence even the discussion of quiet quitting. Covid really disrupted an already strained society. With people dying, lockdowns, and many companies straight up telling people to keep working through it… the corporate sedation has worn off and most Americans are waking up.'"
