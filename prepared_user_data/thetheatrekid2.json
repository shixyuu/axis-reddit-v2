        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting Update: wow, the support!  Thank you all!\nWill now only refer to this as \"Just doing my job\"\nStarting today, I quit working for free.  I won't manage the school food pantry, sew for students or school programs ( uniform alterations, letter jackets, CTE jackets, prom dresses), work the gate or track meets, cover hall duty for others, support fundraisers, sponsor or coach teams, provide snacks to students, participate in staff potluck meals.\n I will arrive 2 minutes before my designated duty time and leave 2 minutes after hours.\nI will take off every Friday to help my family, and take off every PD because I have yet to attend a worthwhile PD (I have only been teaching since 2001, a valuable PD is unlikely to occur in the next year).\nI have 80+ days of leave accrued, and I will leave as few on the table as possible. \nThere is no union power in my state, so I am on my own.', a user said: 'Quiet quitting?
