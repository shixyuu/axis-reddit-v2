        "In response to 'I'm just saying, this is the ONLY experience I've ever had working in grooming salons. (I'm assuming grooming due to blades and what I assume is some fur!)\nIt's always a clique type who pushes one out, and it's never easy to just stop working there. They kick you out your last 2 weeks, they make your life hell, or they do this shit.', a user said: 'Just putting my two cents in, this is not my experience in grooming. The salon I work at is awesome. Everyone cares and no one is intentionally pushing people out, at least not anymore than any other job I’ve worked at outside of dog grooming. I even put a 2 week notice in, worked the full 2 weeks with nothing but positivity coming from the owner. She even hugged me and said good luck when I left, and ultimately welcomed me back with open arms when I came back. I know a lot of salons can be toxic, but there are good ones out there.'",
        "In response to 'This is not the norm. The grooming industry is full of people who peaked in HS and actively try to make the salon a real life mean girls drama. I am many many many years in and finally found a salon I like with the only drama being from clients. They exist, but are almost as rare as unicorns.', a user said: 'Yes, I’m aware it isn’t the norm, hence why I ultimately went back there. Find the good salons and stick with them! For me, the dogs are the ones I’m there for anyways, everything else rolls off my back more or less.'"
