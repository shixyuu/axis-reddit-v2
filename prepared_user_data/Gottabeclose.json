        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting, how many people are actually doing this ? I keep hearing this term, just wonder if people are actually doing it.', a user said: 'My current role came sans job description (maybe my bad but I think it’s on them).\nRole is broad and has huge variety which is great really, though it means I don’t necessarily have a BAU remit.\nBecause of this, I do what’s asked of me as we go. Obviously there are times where it’s clear what I need to do and that’s fine, but the majority of the time, I do only as directed.\nIt’s frustrating as I would rather be in a role I can really dig my teeth into and look to excel. Every previous role I’ve had, it’s taken me 2-3 months to get up to speed and by 6-8 months, I’m cruising on BAU and smashing value-add opportunities. I like to work hard but there needs to be clarity (and reward) in the role for that to be possible for me.\nThis job has sucked the life out of me. Have no coworkers my age… we all work remote, and, it’s not uncommon for me to go a week or two without a normal conversation with a co-worker/team member. Place is so shit, quiet quitting is necessary for me to keep my head any way right.'"
