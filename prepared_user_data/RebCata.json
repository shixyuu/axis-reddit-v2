        "In response to 'Original Post: Has anyone \"Quiet Quit\" as a response to RTO? I'm not in this position, so I don't need advice, but I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this.\nI work remotely, which is why I follow this sub. I've seen a lot of people in this sub who are being asked to RTO. I've been thinking about this the past few days as the sub has been full of people discussing how to respond to RTO mandates.\nLots of people, including myself, are speculating that the recent push for RTO is force people to quit their jobs. If they don't fire you then they don't have to pay out unemployment. And, you have to have significant savings to go without a job.\nWhat do you think about about returning to the office and quiet quitting so you can still draw unemployment? Anyone done this?', a user said: 'Being asked myself to go from full time WFH to hybrid. You better bet I am going to deliberately slow down my productivity on those office days, besides the fact it will naturally happen due to all the “collaboration”.\nAlso pulling way back on my flexibility with my hours when asked, no more jumping on for the odd thing for 5 mins after hours.\nI always thought my employment accommodations and compensation were a negotiation with my employer independent of my work colleagues. Apparently no it’s unfair to others who are hybrid if I’m WFH.'"
