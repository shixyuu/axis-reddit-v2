        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting I monitor the AP email at work and get a lot of strange solicitations but this one really pissed me off.  It was an add for a webinar about ways to combat quiet quitting but their definition was ridiculous.  \"Quiet Quitting is when employees only do exactly what is expected of them never more\" how is this quiet quitting and not just doing your job. I'm both engaged and confused.  I'd heard the term before but never had it defined and man the revolution can't come soon enough!', a user said: 'I just had a lovely conversation with my bobbleheaded, corporate Kool-Aid drinker manager about this sort of thing.\nThey informed me that due to staffing levels I'd be needed to cover other positions. I explained that unless I'm getting that position's wage in addition to my wage for the entirety of my shift, regardless of long I'm actually filling that secondary or tertiary role I won't be doing anything other than exactly what I've been hired for. Before she could object I reminded her that my position sat vacant for a year and if she speaks a single word to me I'll walk. I can have a different job in a day. She'll be stuck. She just fish mouthed.'"
