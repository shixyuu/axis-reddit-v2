        "In response to 'When I was 14, 15 & 16, I worked at a hot dog stand.  My boss paid us (all teens) cash out of the register.  If he came by and someone had done something above-and-beyond, he'd go buy them ice cream, or hand them an extra $20.  After particularly busy weekends he'd take us out to eat AND hand us extra cash.  He bought cases of drinks and a mini fridge for employee use only.  He closed for a holiday and took the entire crew to the beach (included breakfast at his house and meals all day, plus spending money).\nThat's the last boss I have had who was right at my elbow to fairly compensate me for extra effort.  I knew that if I took on a crappy task, I would see a decent reward.  I'd still work for him 30+ years later if I could, because he was a good boss who knew the value of every employee and was ready to pay us for doing jobs that he didn't want to do himself.', a user said: 'Before going self employed the last boss I had was like this. I can't remember the reason, but I had a problem where I basically needed to find an extra £700 a month to balance our house budget.\nI phoned him up, told him the problem and basically said I'll work OT and all that jazz but can he do anything for me, because I liked the company and the job and really didn't want to leave\nHe phoned me back the following day. He doubled my commission percentage and gave me a £350 a month increase, said they couldn't afford to lose me and to come to him again if it wasn't enough.\nI would have stayed there for life given the chance. It's the only job I have ever had where that F word they all like to bandy about actually felt applicable.'"
