[External Link]: https://i.redd.it/6357ek17i7w91.png', a user said: 'I mean honestly,  I started looking to leave my current job due to a new manager/vibe that is pure oppression. But after looking at \"entry level jobs\" that are asking for TEN YEARS experience- Do they ever realize that this is the reason they can't find anybody? After 10 years you world only want to move up.  I'm just hanging in there to see what happens. I'm not changing anything,  (I'm maybe tweaking my habits,  pokng the bear in different spots to see what slides under the radar, I'm obsessed with this,  the anti-metrics). I'm working on my resume, etc. I'm also starting focused and trying to make a point that I do quality work. But I frankly don't care what they think. My goal is to make them look petty,  and crazy and it isn't hard.'"
