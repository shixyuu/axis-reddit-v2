        "In response to 'Jfc I've been chaperoning at least one dance per year for 14 years and the only thing I ever got as compensation was a centerpiece from one prom lol.', a user said: 'My first school was a charter school and we were required to do three events in the contract. I chaperoned the homecoming dance, I helped with the Christmas concert, I helped with parents night in the spring, I did one refereeing of a volleyball game, and I chaperoned prom. If you count that, itâ€™s five events, I did five events. During my end of year review they were disappointed that I only did five events. That and some other stupid trivial things, like getting my paperwork in on the day as opposed to a few days earlier, and only being proficient in my lesson plans, were the reasons why I did not get a raise or the Teacher Advancement Program bonus. I switch districts and got a $12k/yr raise.'"
