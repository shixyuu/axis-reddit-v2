I can see his daily schedule, which is full of meetings, but I'm in half of those meetings with him and he doesn't do or say anything. He doesn't produce anything. He doesn't really supervise me. No idea why operations considers his role necessary, he's a professional meeting attender.'",
        "In response to 'Good for companies because the talent doesn't have to be colocated\nIf the company is paying market rate, 100% agree. But for small city / town employers, what I'm seeing now is them not getting applicants because their pay scales are far lower than any slightly larger city.\nThe end result of this will be location based pay ranges. Which may force all us workers to have to start lying about  where we live.', a user said: 'So spend a couple hundred dollars a year for a PO box and VPN and get thousands of dollars in extra pay. Works for me!'"
