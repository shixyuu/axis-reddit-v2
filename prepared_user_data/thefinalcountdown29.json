        "In response to 'For a student, “quiet quitting” would be getting C’s. Not going above, just doing average work.', a user said: 'This is the answer. What many are doing now is something else entirely. I’ve been teaching over ten years and this is the first year that I have to have a form for students to fill out when they refuse to take a test…multiple choice, could’ve guessed test. They are keenly aware they won’t be held back no matter how little they do. Something’s got to give.\nOh and that form? It’s just their “signature” on a sheet I read aloud to them stating they understand this grade is worth # to their grade and cannot be taken at a later time. It’s copied, sent home for signature, sent to parent email if one is available, and noted in the gradebook. Because, you know, I have to work harder than they do. And I still get cussed out if I call.'"
