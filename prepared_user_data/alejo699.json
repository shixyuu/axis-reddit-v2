        "In response to 'Original Post: Saw this posted on LinkedIn: “Quiet Quitting” [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/g2rczsex4xh91.jpg', a user said: '“Where are the go-getters? Where are the workers who are hungry for success?”\nYou drained them all dry, you dumb fucks. You thought you could continue to expect 110% when you give less and less every year? When there is no pension plan and layoffs can appear out of nowhere? \nFuck your “work ethic” and the casual paternalism it rode in on.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing. They just called it “mailing it in” and the movie Office Space is a commentary on this.', a user said: 'This GenXer has little patience for bullshit but I also realized I was more indoctrinated into the puritan work ethic nonsense than younger people are.  I remember at least twenty years ago hearing how millennials didn't want to wear business attire or work 9-5 hours and I thought, \"What's this shit?  I have to do it, why shouldn't they?\"\nUnlike many Boomers, I realized how stupid that sentiment was pretty quick.'"
