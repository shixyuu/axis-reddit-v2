        "In response to 'Original Post: Is anyone else “quiet quitting” or just completely burnt out? I’m just completely over it. I used to be so “hungry” and now I’m catching myself doing the bare minimum, and I genuinely don’t care if I get fired.\nI think the largest factor is that I’m not getting paid until equipment ships and we’ve been on a year+ lead-time, so the carrot is essentially gone.\nI don’t have an ounce of ambition left in me, and it sucks because I have “golden handcuffs” to this job because I have over $50k in commissions waiting for me.\nIs anyone else feeling the same?', a user said: 'I sleep all day and log in for teams meetings sometimes or go do errands. Nobody really notices and I don’t care.'",
        "In response to 'I need this', a user said: 'Do just enough email urgent emails but don’t really gotta be on the computer if you do it right'",
        "In response to 'Bruh you could almost do your whole sales job from your phone if you have all the apps connected  (SFDC, Slack, Email, Zoom, etc)', a user said: 'I be doing that. Only thing is if you get a video call and your at target lol'",
        "In response to 'Come to think of it…. People grind and destroy themselves daily for a fraction of what we get. We have it so good man, something tells me the world is changing fast and this won’t last forever…  let’s maximize the shit out of this', a user said: 'Oh no it’s gonna get better. I’m a recruiter and if I have a job where they have to show in person they ghost. Remote people are blowing me up for. Demand is remote and I think the next step is four day work week. I’ll never let a company run me to the ground again'",
        "In response to 'Hey you know what, that’s true. We’ve reached that point where we just won’t take that shit anymore. The world is changing. Fingers crossed - Only up from here.', a user said: 'Yea it’s not going back to how it was'"
