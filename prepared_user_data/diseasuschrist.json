        "In response to 'I had a teammate quiet quit at my last job. Essentially she quit about a year before she just stopped showing up. \nShe would tell people that she was working, she’d put in a good effort at meetings and because we were remote and adults, they assumed she was telling the truth. \nIt all started to unravel slowly and she started taking meetings in her car, at doctors appointments in the waiting room and eventually she just started showing up late & missing meetings. We slowly found out there was a huge backlog of work that wasn’t done for her clients even though she told them and us it was done. She b.s.ed all of us to cover her tracks so she didn’t have to actually do any work. \nTowards the end she was constantly out sick. She would sit in on meetings while leadership basically yelled at her and she would swear she would knock it all out in time, but she never did anything. \nEventually she “got sick” and went on disability- or so she said, so she couldn’t be fired. She never completed the paperwork apparently so the company had to continue paying her for months and months. \nThey couldn’t reach her. She didn’t answer the phone, wouldn’t answer messages on linked in… never called. \nWe found out later she went back to her old job and was most likely getting two paychecks for a while. \nI think the whole process was quiet quitting but eventually led to job abandonment.', a user said: 'My hero!'"
