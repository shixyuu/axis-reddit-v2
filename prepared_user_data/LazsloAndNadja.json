        "In response to 'Original Post: Robyn's been quiet quitting for yrs. I've just listened to Ace and Katelyn's pod and they hit the nail on the head about Robyn and Kody's main income coming from the Sisterwives show.\nIt's been annoying me for a while that Robyn's input in the show has slowly been regressing each season. She gives less and less every season. They won't even let the crew in the house now.\nShe has been quiet quitting the show for years. Puts in minimal effort because there's no other way she can earn $. Soon she'll just zoom her talking head into production. ðŸ˜†', a user said: 'Ace and Katelyn donâ€™t want to be on Reddit! Yâ€™all be nice to them, theyâ€™re going through it.\nI havenâ€™t finished todayâ€™s (last nights) podcast, but yeah, it does seem like Sobynâ€™s not been invested in the show. Or the family. Or anything other than junk journals and dolly clothes.\nSplish splash'"
