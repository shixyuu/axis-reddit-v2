        "In response to 'It's amazing how many men view the quiet quitting as a good thing. The Tiktoks consistently talk about how the male partners viewed the attempts at fixing the relationship as nagging, so they're happy when it stops. They think that things are finally good despite not making any meaningful changes themselves.\nThere was a Reddit post last year that talked about a \"tolerable level of permanent unhappiness\"... That phrase stuck with me, and I think it fed a lot of these conversations. The quiet quitting usually happens subconsciously in reaction to that permanent unhappiness. We don't give up all at once, we do it in steps.', a user said: 'I think the whole era of \"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\" did so much damage to the modern relationship. That book and it's spin offs were everywhere, and it seemed like everyone alive in the early 90s was drinking the kool-aid. Honestly, I never read more than a summation, but it seemed like what everyone culturally took away from it was \"men and women inherently act and think differently, and have different goals.\"\nThe result was a generation of men who came away believing they couldn't actually be friends with women, and women who were forced to turn a blind eye to poorly socialized behavior and say \"boys will be boys.\" That men and women needed to be tricked into supporting each other because the same things couldn't make them both happy. So plenty of men brought up in that enviroment (and now their kids) believe their friends are the guys they drink, game and watch TV with, and women are there to do the mother work and otherwise function as goaltenders to sex and \"fun.\" They really don't believe that women could get into sports, be fun to game with, like sci-fi, or actually enjoy sex.\nOn top of that, far too many men don't have friends they can talk to about anything that is emotional in nature. They are men and not emotional. That's what women do and are for. So, they dump their emotional baggage at home and go hang in the man cave, or wherever the fuck, with their friends. Friends that are almost purely topical. They rarely touch outside of mock or real violence and rarely discuss anything in a way that has any component of vulnerability. It would just be sad if it didn't cause so much strife with women who want true connection.'"
