        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'I did this shortly before retiring. I worked for a nonprofit for nearly 30 years and was the president of my union there.\nI was a dedicated employee who never let my union activities interfere with my job and in fact gave 120%. Not only was it not appreciated, an upline manager retaliated against me by failing to approve my well-deserved promotion three times. My manager was a nice person, but weak-kneed and didn’t have the courage to go to bat for me, even though he supported my promotion. The upline manager denied it was intentional or retribution, I couldn’t prove it and HR was, of course, unsupportive\nI gave 30 days notice to my manager, even though zero notice was required and told him I wanted only those people who absolutely needed to know,  informed. I wasn’t interested in any type of celebration because it just felt hypocritical and gave HR an earful in my exit interview.\nWhen I drove out of the parking lot the last time, it was the best feeling and I’ve never looked back. My only regret is not doing it sooner.'"
