        "In response to 'I actually got fired for this last week. A new sales manager was hired and had one on ones with the sales team. I let him know that this job isn’t my entire life and my family and life outside of work is my priority. I said I will do the job and I will do it well and make you money but I’m here to do a job and go home. He didn’t like that so a week later I was fired for “not a culture fit.”', a user said: 'I quit a job a few months back for something like this. There was a client shipment that we shipped out around midnight. My workday started at 8 am and always began with a team meeting. At 8:12, twelve minutes into the meeting, I was reamed out for not having provided an email update to the customer yet. On a shipment that went out at midnight.\nI told my boss I had no intention of answering customer emails at midnight and wasn't going to start. Boss snapped at me (still in front of everyone) that I was being ridiculous and that of COURSE I wasn't expected to send emails at midnight. I asked when exactly I was supposed to have provided the update then, since I'd be at work for twelve minutes, and in the meeting with the team the whole time. I was told I could have checked the messages from my company phone and sent an update before I left the house (I was salaried). I said that before my workday, my morning consists of taking care of pets, getting children ready and on the bus, and getting myself ready for the day, and because that is my personal time, I use it to handle my personal business so that when I'm at work, I can handle work.\nFrom that point on, they did everything they could to manage me out. Changed meeting times and told everyone but me so I missed them. Undid my work behind my back and then threw me under the bus to customers so I looked incompetent. Stuff like that.'"
