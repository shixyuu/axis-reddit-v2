        "In response to 'Original Post: Students refusing to do work because they're \"quiet quitting\" Has anyone experienced students not wanting to do any work (not necessarily \"extra\" work, but any work really) and mentioning something related to \"quiet quitting\" as a reason when asked?', a user said: 'Wow, a LOT here have no idea what “quiet quitting” actually means.\nIt does NOT mean “not doing any work.”\nIt does NOT mean “pretending to work.”\nIt does NOT mean “doing so little that you force someone to fire you.”\nWhat it DOES mean is that you do the job that you were hired for, no more, no less. It means no longer going “above and beyond” with no compensation.\nStudents that refuse to do the basic work required to earn a grade, aren’t “quiet quitting.”'"
