        "In response to 'Thanks! I have the appetite, just hadn’t heard of any of these before. I’ve been working in small companies. I appreciate the recommendations. I’ve started trying to learn Python. Do you have any suggestions on subreddits to follow or resources to start learning automation tools without a coding background? I’ll take any and all guidance!', a user said: 'For the easiest and most straightforward start, get the book Automate the Boring Stuff With Python. Make sure it's the last edition. It'll give you more or less step by step instructions to build basic programs to do basic tasks.\nIf you'd like more flexibility and ability to mix those blocks and to build more custom programs, do CS50P. It'll teach you basic Python in general. Do the basic exercises and try the advanced ones. It'll feel like you have no idea what you're doing. That's intended: a lot of programming is searching for solutions. Every question you get had likely already been answered a thousand times: you just have to find it.\nIf you like to understand things you do a bit better, I'd heavily recommend to start with the first three weeks of CS50 (without the P) before moving on to CS50P. It's for C, not Python, but it'll teach you some basics about how computers and code operate that Python sources like to gloss over because Python sort of handles that stuff automatically for you, but that will bite your ass at some point when you start doing more complex things with your data.\nAfter that, you just have to program stuff and learn as you go.'"
