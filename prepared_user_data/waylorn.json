        "In response to 'Original Post: Office Space Proves Gen X believed in quiet quitting too - it was called “mailing it in” I don’t want to hear any Gen Xer talk about Millennials or Gen Z “quiet quitting” when they 100% did the same thing. They just called it “mailing it in” and the movie Office Space is a commentary on this.', a user said: 'No Gen-Xers are talking about quiet quitting, we did and still do the same thing.  The media is trying to continue this bullshit line.  Quiet Quitting isn't a thing, its' called \"doing what you hired and pay me to do, no more, no less\".   MSM wants to make not going above and beyond without compensation or for intangible compensation back to being the standard.  Shit, Office Space wasn't the only Gen X movie to show that off (probably the best one though lol).'"
