Only give 100% on a temporary basis.', a user said: 'Because decades of sports really fucked up my work ethic. Constantly hearing \"give it 110%\" really pushed it deep to constantly work harder and harder. It wasn't until much later in life that i learned balance and that constantly pushing is just not physically or mentally possible'",
        "In response to 'And the phrase itself is culture war bullshit. My first time reading \"quiet quitting\" was in a publication that sells advertising to employers.\nThis is all about the moneyed class demonizing the working class for not handing over their lives for free when the rich demand it.', a user said: 'Exactly they just rephrased \"doing your job\" to make it seem like this nefarious thing'",
        "In response to 'Yeah I'm still working on that, cause I always give 110 percent for the things I'm passionate about, but then I keep doing that for things I shouldn't. Any advice for that?', a user said: 'I figured it out by years of being burnt out. I was in a dark place and finally stopped at therapy.'"
