        "In response to 'This is why when I made the switch to freelancing I got a virtual phone number for my business and set it up to go straight to voicemail outside of my office hours. If it comes in outside of regular business hours, it can wait. I also close the tab with my work email when I quit for the day. I might occasionally still check things outside those hours if I feel like it, but I never\nrespond\noutside of regular business hours.\nAll that being said, at my last salaried job I did entrust my cell number to my boss because she was a reasonable person and I trusted her. In my eight years there, she only called me after-hours once and it was when the building literally flooded and it was all hands on deck to carry out our emergency plan (it was a museum, so...kind of important). That's how it should be; after-hours contact should only happen if you're being paid to be on-call (and have time when you're not) or if it's a true emergency.', a user said: 'You have the right idea. Any time I take on a new job, I go and get myself a new Google voice number. When the job ends, I stop using the number. I also don’t add coworkers on social media. Maybe if I really like someone I will add them after I leave, but never while I’m still there. It’s worked pretty well so far.'"
