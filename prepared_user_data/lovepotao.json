        "In response to 'Original Post: Anyone Ever Quiet Quit a Trip? This has happened probably three times where I get close to the end of a trip and just become over it all and just end to get back home (the US). I don’t want to visit another church/palace/museum, I don’t want to wander anymore (my feet hurt). I’m tired of eating out and just done with it all. Doesn’t mean I’ve had a bad time, but I’m ready to be back in my comfort zone and bed. So when this feeling hits. I sort of find myself shutting down.\nThen, I feel guilty because I’ve flown across the world to be in a city people dream of visiting and I’m not soaking in every moment. I will say when my social connections are low, this quiet quitting happens faster. But despite 100 museums and sites. I have no energy to see anymore.\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nEdit: I’m trying to read all of these responses, on touchy airplane WiFi. But thank you for your responses!', a user said: 'Once I came home a few days early from a solo trip as I was too lonely to keep enjoying it- to this day I don’t regret doing that. It’s your time and money.\nThat being said, I thankfully haven’t had that happen since. However, that likely is at least in part due to the fact that I’ve never been able to travel for more than 2 weeks at a time (I prefer to stay at nice hotels so 2 weeks per year is what my trip budget allows). If I were to travel for longer than that I am positive I would become exhausted.'"
