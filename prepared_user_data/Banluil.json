        "In response to 'Yeah. I worked five minutes past when I’m supposed to log off to finish up a project yesterday. I’m salary so I don’t see how it would matter to anyone else, but my boss scolded me when she got an email notification that I had finished the project. She also keeps reminding me to hurry up and use all my PTO before the year ends. Love this woman.', a user said: 'I try to stay on top of the people that work for me, making sure that they use vacation time whenever they need it, or hell, even just need a mental vacation day.  Take the time off.  We can handle it when you are gone.\nOur PTO rolls over (up to a certain limit), and I do my best to make sure my people never hit that limit.  Yes, we need them here, or we would have never hired them, but we would rather them be mentally sound and working good while they are here.'"
