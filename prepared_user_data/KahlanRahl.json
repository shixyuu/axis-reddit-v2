        "In response to 'Still getting a \"satisfactory\" on that review tho because \"there's always room for improvement\"', a user said: 'Where I work, they grade you on 7-8 criteria on a 1-5 scale. If you get better than 3 on half or more, you automatically qualify for a ~5% raise. If you ever get 2 or more fives, you get put in the pool for management promotion. Needless to say, not a single person in our office of 20 has ever had more than two 4s on any review. No 5s. Why bother with the reviews if you’re just going to mandate that everyone gets an “average” score regardless of performance?'"
