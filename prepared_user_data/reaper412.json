        "In response to 'Thanks for a real answer! To summarize, you're saying that it's a bs term?', a user said: 'It's a buzzword. Quiet Quitting has existed for decades, the word for that has been \"coasting\" - just doing the bare minimum and putting in your 8 hours. What has changed is that as the previous poster said, the market has shifted to favor employees, you now have significantly more people coasting at their jobs, so HR decided to start calling it quiet quitting to make it sound like it's bad.\nDon't let companies take advantage of you and only do the work you're paid for.'",
        "In response to 'lolllllll “HR is calling it quiet quitting”. You have no idea how many times i have had to explain to managers that they can’t put someone on a performance improvement plan because they are meeting the expectations and not going above and beyond.\nManagement calls it quiet quitting cause they don’t know shit about people. HR calls it “equity theory”.', a user said: 'Sounds like you have some psycho boomer managers you work with. I honestly don't know where it originates from, but from my experience working as a manager in a corporate environment, campaigns like this are usually a joint effort between HR Directors and Managers, though not all companies are the same so there's that.\nMy expectations from anyone that worked for me has always been that meeting the minimum expectations is good enough for me, they get their bonus, I get their bonus and everyone's happy. The company doesn't give a shit about us as people so I see no reason to stress myself over making them richer, if I don't see any reward for it.'",
        "In response to 'Original Post: \"Quiet Quitting\" is henceforth returned to \"Working to Rule\". [External Link]: https://i.redd.it/zyuip9dwb68a1.png', a user said: 'Quiet Quitting is just a victim blaming term for \"Coasting\"'"
