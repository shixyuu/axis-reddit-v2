        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting, how many people are actually doing this ? I keep hearing this term, just wonder if people are actually doing it.', a user said: 'If you're using this definition:\nQuiet quitting refers to doing the minimum requirements of one’s job and putting in no more time, effort, or enthusiasm than absolutely necessary. As such, it is something of a misnomer, since the worker doesn’t actually leave their position and continues to collect a salary.\nThen I am 100% quiet quitting.\nI work in Statutory Planning and by virtue of the profession have to be somewhat of a generalist in all facets of development. The more knowledgeable you are, the higher the chance that you become the de-facto \"fixer\" for all related matters.\nNone of the above is recordable, measurable or assessed as part of my KPI's. \"Quiet Quitting\" is mostly an exercise in effective time management for me. Especially when promotions are based on \"selection criteria\" rather than demonstrated aptitude.'"
