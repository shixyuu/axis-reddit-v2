        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet quitting: why doing the bare minimum at work has gone global | Work & careers [External Link]: https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/06/quiet-quitting-why-doing-the-bare-minimum-at-work-has-gone-global', a user said: 'I regularly get to work an hour early and don’t have time for lunch breaks.\nMy boss said to me last month ‘I don’t want you to think that it hasn’t gone unnoticed that you’re always starting work early, or that it’s not appreciated…but what would be really helpful would be if you could also stay an hour later every day too’\nAll unpaid of course.\nI start work an hour early because the work my boss (micro company with only 4 people) expects me to do is enough work for 2+ full time people.  He actually had the audacity to say to me the other day that ‘if you’re not up to doing everything, then maybe we can look at removing some of your responsibilities, obviously that will involve a pay cut though’\nUnfortunately he’s one of those bosses that hasn’t got a clue how much work is involved in my job, adding in to that a constantly ringing phone that needs answering, constant phone calls and voice message after voice message from him each day on WhatsApp (most of the time 20+ per day) and thinks everything only takes 2 minutes to do!'"
