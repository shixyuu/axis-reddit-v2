        "In response to 'Teachers call this working the contract.  If your day is contracted 7:45a -2:45p you'd leave as close to 2:45p as possible.  Obviously you'll have to correct papers & do lesson planning. But do that at home before you get assigned more work from the school by staying late', a user said: 'My union calls is Work to Rule and we make a big show of it. We rally at the front of the building and walk in together when the bell rings. We walk out together at the end of the contracted day.'"
