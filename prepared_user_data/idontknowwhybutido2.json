        "In response to 'A lot of the TikToks in the video mention how men are usually \"blindsided\" when their partners just up and leave, when the reality is they didn't care to notice the signs since their partner's unhappiness wasn't directly affecting them.\nThere was a good post about how men think there is a tolerable level of permanent unhappiness that women are cool with staying in. They are fine with our suffering because they still get to do the things they want and not do the things women want them to do. When hetero women start to pull away, a lot of men are actually happy because they think they won. No longer are you \"nagging\" or telling them you are unhappy. Then when you dump them, they are shocked because to them, the relationship has never been better!', a user said: 'ðŸŽ¶You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)ðŸŽ¶'"
