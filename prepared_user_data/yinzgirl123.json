        "In response to 'Its seller greed.\nBuy a house in 1997 for 91k. Assessed value 315k in 2019 with 4.5% interest rates. Neighbors identical home sells for 650k in 2022 with 2.75% interest rates.\nInterest rates are now 6%. Should the value be 675k? 325k? Sellers are delusional and think their home is worth what it was at 2.25% + 10% appreciation/yr since. They don't actually have a 600k cost basis. That's if they're the smart ones and didn't take a huge cash out refinance / home equity loan during covid to buy a Ferrari and get their wife's tits redone.\nYou know why they can't drop the price? Because 60% of boomers have no retirement. If the value of the only thing they own drops, all of 'em are gonna be fucked.\nWe have to fund their retirement because they didn't save and plan accordingly.', a user said: 'Millennials are going to fund the retirement of Boomers through inflated housing costs and higher taxes while their own Medicare and Social Security will be highly cut or the programs will collapse entirely.\nShouldn’t have eaten all that Avocado Toast I guess'",
        "In response to 'Do you realize how much money was injected into the economy in 2020?  M1 money supply pre Covid was right around $4Trillion… now?  It sits around $19Trillion dollars.  That’s right,  money supply is almost 5x from what it was 3 years ago.  Now tell me you’re surprised housing prices have sky rocketed… The govt is printing our dollar to death, only way to fight it is to buy assets that don’t care how much a dollar is worth', a user said: 'And if they keep printing to support Boomer retirements inflation gets worse, if they stop printing they will need to cut entitlements and raise taxes. Millennials and Gen Z get screwed either way.'"
