        "In response to 'Original Post: Japan's historic work ethic is decliningâ€”45% of workers admit they're quiet quitting [External Link]: https://fortune.com/article/japan-work-ethic-declining-45-percent-of-workers-quiet-quitting/', a user said: 'Interestingly, this the same problem were seeing in the US, and it's likely to be the same problem China will see in the coming decades.\nWhen the economy is booming and people are able to advance up the social/economic ladder, living more prosperous lives than their parents, they are more willing to be stressed over work, and to work hard/long hours.\nBut sooner or later countries reach a tipping point and the quality of life stops improving or even starts declining from previous generations, and more and more people dont feel inclined to work as hard or as long if they dont feel like theyre reaping the benefits anymore.\nIn other words, people are becoming increasingly burnt out and are therefore less willing to shift their work/life balance more heavily towards work unless they are seeing direct benefits from it.\nAlso worth noting that many Asian nations with rather extreme \"work ethics,\" such as Japan, have some of the highest suicide rates on the planet.'"
