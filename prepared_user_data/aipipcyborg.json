        "In response to 'A mortgage payment is DOUBLE what it was four years ago. This is unsustainable. My mortgage payment 4 years ago was $1200. You're going to have a tough time convincing me that I should pay twice that for less house. This is not a normal or healthy housing market and interest rates aren't the problem.\nInterest rates are what caused payments to increase, so how can it not be interest rates?  Homes in most places went up around 30-40%, so that certainly canâ€™t explain it.', a user said: '130k to 400k for a similar home in my area. Old, small, and with a small lot.\nWages haven't even moved close to that. Meanwhile, people from out of town complaining on FB that they can't find a job that will support rent or mortgage.\nWelcome to the South.'"
