        "In response to 'Original Post: Quiet Quitting: What is it Really? Quiet quitting is a confusing term to me, but maybe I just don’t understand it. I have rarely ever given 120% to a job… maybe when I was fresh out of college when I had that mindset. But the years have jaded me. What people call “quiet quitting” (doing the minimum) is what I just call doing my job lol. It’s not like I refuse when they ask me to do more work (tho rarely do they ask), but I don’t SEEK more work out unless I’m just bored. For example, in my work, we work in Sprints and get assigned stories to do for those sprints. I just do those stories — not more or less — unless I’m just bored and have finished my stories weeks in advance, then I may grab a story for the next Sprint. I get paid by the hour so no work means no pay. But it’s not like I can ADD more stories to the current Sprint because someone else still needs to test them and THEY may not have capacity. So, a lot of times I just do things around the house since there always seems to be something to do at home. Have I been quiet quitting for years and just didn’t know it or is doing the minimum not really what quiet quitting is all about?', a user said: 'Maybe sometimes it's just the motivation as well, but yeah I do the minimum as well, used to go all out and work really hard In my previous jobs but never got recognised/rewarded more for it so that changed my mindset to be thinking it's not really worth it going above and beyond.\nBut yeah if I get asked to do something I'll happily do it without complaints and just get it done, if not I do what I need to do, get paid and go home'"
