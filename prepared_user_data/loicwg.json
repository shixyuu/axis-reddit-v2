        "In response to 'Original Post: It's NOT \"quiet quitting!!!\" \"Working your contract,\" \"working to rule\" and \"acting your wage\" are all MUCH better terms. Why would you use the word \"quit\" to describe you adhering to your contract and doing your job? It has nothing but negative connotations AND denotation.\nI highly encourage everyone here to lose that term. We're working our contracts. We're not quitting anything. Some may STOP giving away their physical and/or emotional labor, but that's not the same as quitting!\nEdit: For those of you saying \"It's called 'doing our job'\" The implications of teachers \"just doing our job\" are:  volunteering for events, grading/planning at home, taking over other  peoples' responsibilities, adding more to your plate every year, etc...  Admin considers this \"just doing your job.\"', a user said: 'This is 100% an attempt by the oligarchy to rebrand \"work to rule\" that started decades ago.  Their abuse if workers has just increased the rate at which people work to rule, so they needed to put a negative spin on it, in order to ostracize the growing number of dissatisfied labor.\nDon't be fooled by their PR bullshit, work how they pay you and give nothing to them for free.'"
