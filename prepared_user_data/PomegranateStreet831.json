        "In response to 'Original Post: What's your opinion on quiet quitting? Been doing it for almost a fortnight now, and it's changed my life (for the better).\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.', a user said: 'Employers buy into the bullshit spouted by those Get Rich book authors, the ones that are always telling us that the only way to be rich like them is to spend more time at the office, do more work, suck up to the boss etc etc…there is an obvious problem, only a very very small percentage of the population is going to be rich employers or rich managers.\nEmployers want you to believe that even though they are only paying you for 40 hours of work you should be grateful for that and want to do more just to show your gratitude, you should make yourself available 24/7, be constantly checking emails and messages, work your leave around business, don’t take sick days etc etc, and if you do all that well then maybe you might just be in line for the next promotion, or that massive 1-2% pay rise.\nHere’s a thought, if employers actually paid more,  made more effort and creating a better work/life balance, and incentivised productivity then maybe they would get employees who didn’t mind putting in more effort.\nBut for most employees working the minimum you have to, making sure you stick to office hours, don’t take calls, answer messages or reply to emails outside of office hours, don’t don’t do unpaid overtime, be only as involved as needed to actually get the job done, is all that is needed. It’s not quiet quitting, it’s working to your contract'"
