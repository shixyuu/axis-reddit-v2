        "In response to 'Original Post: What are your thoughts on “quiet quitting”? Is it something you’ve been doing for a while or something you’ve recently started implementing? For those who don’t know, quiet quitting refers to not over extending yourself and going above and beyond at work such as taking on more responsibilities or staying late. You do what’s asked of you then go home on time.', a user said: 'When I stopped working shitty serving jobs for $2.13 an hour and entered the corporate world I made hard boundaries for myself. I do my job, I do it well, and I leave my work at work. I take 100% of my PTO, every mandated break, and I refuse to allow my mental health or home life be negatively effected by a company that sees me as a number. In the last few years a big thing I’ve noticed is companies trying to have me install Teams or Zoom on my personal cell phone. At orientation or what not I’ll just say “my phone is for personal use so unless there’s some sort of reimbursement for the bill I will not be doing that”\nWhat I’ve seen over the last 15 or so years is that being this way has always worked in my favor. I have been respected by management, sometimes to an unfair degree compared to others, and I have a great work life balance.\nI am not sure why I am like this but I assume it’s that I entered the corporate world in early 2008 and immediately watched layoff after layoff during the housing crisis. I saw people who had worked for a multi billion dollar company for decades be laid off with maybe 2-4 weeks of severance. I realized that they do NOT give a fuck about you or your family or the work and dedication you’ve given to a company for over half your life.\nSo to answer your question, yes I’ve always done this and I’m really glad other people are waking up and realizing that collectively they need us more than we need them.'"
