        "In response to 'I did for a while earlier this year, I was a really hard worker at my company about a year ago and would always exceed my kpis. In January I found out I was going to be made redundant through my manager so I slowed down my pace with work to focus on my mental health and looking for other roles. On the 3 days from home where I wasn't in the office I would log on at like 10am, answer a few things then log off until 4pm when I would respond to some emails before clocking off and repeat. I wouldn't recommend this as I had clients and internal coworkers getting pretty pissed, however I was told I couldn't tell my coworkers about the redundancy.\nMentally I really didn't have the energy to be fucked working for a place that was letting me go. However, 3-4 months passed and the redundancy didn't happen since they realized they needed me, right after I found that out I ended up quitting. Luckily I just accepted a new role at what seems to be a better company.', a user said: 'ðŸ¥‡\nYou win!!!'"
