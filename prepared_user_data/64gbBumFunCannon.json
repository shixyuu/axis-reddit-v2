        "In response to 'Original Post: What do you think of \"Quiet quitting\"? This is a term thats been making the rounds on social media recently. Basically doing the bare minimum at work to not get fired.\nReminds me of the old Homer Simpson quote: \"If you hate your job you dont strike, you just go in every day and do it really half assed\".', a user said: 'Why is this called Quiet quitting? Being paid to do your job, and doing the minimum still means it's getting done.\nQuiet quitting would make sense if you left and never returned without a word.\nFuckin' fuckers making fuckin' bullshit phrasing to make it sound like you should be giving them your soul.'",
        "In response to 'The phrase “quiet quitting” needs to go.\nBeing paid to do what you do and not letting yourself get exploited isn’t quiet quitting.\nEdit: I appreciate the awards but rather than wasting your money on fake internet points I’d much rather you donate it to a charity which helps people still caught in the industry trap that I’ve talked about below.\nDonate or go any buy some gear from\nThe Burnt Chef Project\n.', a user said: 'Not that long ago the phrase \"act your wage\" was being thrown about, and suddenly I kept getting adverts for a BBC article about \"quiet quitting\" and I have to wonder, is this an active effort to change the wording to something negative? Because it sure feels it.'"
