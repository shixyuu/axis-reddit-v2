        "In response to '[Deleted or Empty Comment]', a user said: 'I understand your pain. I would love to live in a pedestrian friendly as well but those cities are far and between in the US.\nBeing priced out of your own city is definitely a punch in the gut but there are still many places where a single software developer can buy property. Not receiving money from family is a disadvantage but I ask you to put yourselves in their parents position, if you could give a leg up to your progeny would you do it or not do it because it is unfair to the other market participants? I think 100% of people would gift money if it was within their means.\nI am an immigrant who came here without money and I was able to carve myself a position in the software industry and a house but to achieve this I had to uproot my life to a different city.\nI know my advice is not a feel good advice but the reality is that life is unfair and you have to play with the cards you have at your disposition.'"
